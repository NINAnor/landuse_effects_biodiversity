AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize the main operational processes adopted by a shrimp aquaculture pond system in Brazil and to account the flows of energy use. The characterization was carried out via application of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRIMA) methodology. The accounting of the energy flows was made through the quantification of the energy coming from economically required resources. Based on the data and characteristics identified in Brazilian shrimp farms, a hypothetical farm consisting of four nursery tanks, nine ponds, feed, fertilizer and general deposits, a refectory, restrooms and dressing rooms, garage, and main and secondary access roads. In this hypothetical shrimp farm, the water pumping was performed by a 20 hp pump, and aeration was performed via 4 hp paddle-type aerators. A biphasic operating system and a semi-intensive production regime were adopted, with a initial stocking density of 43 shrimp m(-2) and harvest occurring when the shrimp reached an average weight of 12 g. The cultivation cycle lasted 90 days and include the pond preparation and curing period. The final yield was estimated to be 3500 kg ha(-1). The total energy cost was calculated as 835.597 MJ. The most energy inputs were feed, fuels and lubricants and electricity. Shrimp production in ponds is a very intensive activity relative to the energy demand and that increasing energy efficiency is one of the essential conditions for the truly sustainable production of long-term Brazilian shrimp farming not only for environmental but also mainly for economic reasons.

AB  - In Vietnam, fisheries play a key role in the national economy. Helminth infections in fish have a major impact on public health and sustainable fish production. A comprehensive summary of the recent knowledge on fish helminths is important to understand the distribution of parasites in the country, and to design effective control measures. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted, collecting available literature published between January 2004 and October 2020. A total of 108 eligible records were retrieved reporting 268 helminth species, among which are digeneans, monogeneans, cestodes, nematodes and acanthocephalans. Some helminths were identified with zoonotic potential, such as, the heterophyids, opisthorchiids, the nematodes Gnathostoma spinigerum, Anisakis sp. and Capillaria spp. and the cestode Hysterothylacium; and with highly pathogenic potential, such as, the monogeneans of Capsalidae, Diplectanidae and Gyrodactylidae, the nematodes Philometra and Camallanidae, the tapeworm Schyzocotyle acheilognathi, the acanthocephalans Neoechinorhynchus and Acanthocephalus. Overall, these studies only covered about nine percent of the more than 2400 fish species occurring in the waters of Vietnam. Considering the expansion of the aquaculture sector as a part of the national economic development strategy, it is important to expand the research to cover the helminth fauna of all fish species, to assess their potential zoonotic and fish health impacts.

AB  - Soil erosion control practices have been extensively conducted in the Chinese Loess Plateau, which is one of the most severe soil erosion regions in the world. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of these erosion control practices in this region is lacking. Thus, this systematic review examined the use of erosion control practices in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The key question addressed in this paper is: how soil erosion control practices have been used in the Chinese Loess Plateau? The assessment was based on (1) the categories of erosion control practice, (2) the spatial scales conducted by each erosion control practice, and (3) the costeffectiveness of each erosion control practice. One hundred peer-reviewed papers were selected, and our results highlighted: (1) 57% of the studies, 32% of the studies, and 11% of the studies evaluated the effectiveness or impacts of ecological restoration programs, engineering techniques, and soil management techniques on soil erosion, respectively, but multiple erosion control practices evaluation received a little attention. (2) The watershed scale assessment dominated the published studies (65% of the reviewed papers), followed by plot scale assessments (35% of the reviewed papers), but the cross-scale evaluation has received little attention. (3) Soil erosion control practices have enhanced most of the soil-related ecosystem services but partially damaged water-related ecosystem services. These control practices caused trade-offs between soil erosion control and water provision and synergies between soil erosion control and water use efficiency, water regulation, and crop production. These synergy and trade-off relationships among soil erosion control practices and ecosystem services might be changed as time passes. Then, three recommendations are suggested for future studies: (1) a combination of erosion control practice assessment needs to be developed, (2) a cross-scale assessment needs to be examined, and (3) a rational balance between soil and water conservation needs to be considered.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in eco-innovation among SMEs. So, there is a need to gain a better understanding of the most recent advances in academic research as well as recent practical organizational efforts. This was accomplished through a systematic review of the eco-innovation literature pertaining to small and medium businesses (published between 2002 and 2020). To conduct this systematic literature review, we used data from one of the most comprehensive databases, the Scopus database. This study analyzed 80 articles from a total of 205 articles. The data selected for this paper is guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagrams. This paper provides a descriptive overview of a selected article in the field of eco-innovation, analyzing the growth trend of published articles, popular methodologies used, most productive regions, top journals, and industries in which eco-innovation is studied mostly. This study also identifies the key research areas in the body of literature, classifying the main factors influencing and impeding the adoption of eco-innovations, the prevailing theories, as well as the effects and outcomes of eco-innovation adoption in SMEs. The findings of this study provide crucial information on eco-innovation for academicians and professionals, enabling them to advance the research agenda in the field.

AB  - Sustainable Intensification (SI) is a term that has been advanced to capture a concept that some consider as the 'third paradigm' for global agricultural development. However, the term has become subject to intense debates as well as scepticism and confusion regarding its meaning and the characteristics of production systems that could indicate SI (defined as "indicators"). This has resulted in a proliferation of literature. We have conducted a systematic review of a sample of this literature analysing the most commonly suggested indicators of SI in order to investigate the extent to which the critiques of SI are valid in their viewpoints that SI is an oxymoron, underpinned by a productivist agenda, and to identify the critical issues in the development of a comprehensive and unambiguous set of SI indicators. From 633 articles identified by a search of relevant databases, a sample of 75 articles were selected and analysed using the NVIVO (TM) software. The results were organised according to a Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) framework comprising seven sub-systems or components - resource system, resource units, governance system, resource users, interactions, outcomes, and environment. A total of 218 indicators (both positive and negative) were identified. Most of these indicators focused on the 'outcomes' of agricultural systems with the majority being related to agricultural production. Few indicators were identified as relating to the economic and societal dimensions of food systems. Whilst this potentially suggested a productivist bias in the current interpretation of SI it was difficult to draw a black and white conclusion, since for the other system components, the majority of the indicators suggested appeared to take a more holistic point-of-view and emphasised both productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems. Our analysis suggests that a key reason why SI may be viewed with scepticism is a lack of specificity and elucidation of the rationale, scale, and farm type for which SI is proposed. Moreover, a number of the indicators were so loosely defined that the interventions they imply could be enacted without due consideration of the social impacts of their adoption. We conclude that there is need to develop SI indicators according to specific farming types and scales and also with more consideration of the social and political dimensions of food systems in order to promote a constructive dialogue around the concept of SI to take place. Unless the concept of SI is described and measured in such a holistic and inclusive manner, it is unlikely to be accepted as a valid descriptor of sought-after agricultural practices by players in the Third Sector.

AB  - SWAT, a watershed modeling tool has been proposed to help quantify ecosystem services. The concept of ecosystem services incorporates the collective benefits natural systems provide primarily to human beings. It is becoming increasingly important to track the impact that human activities have on the environment in order to determine its resilience and sustainability. The objectives of this paper are to provide an overview of efforts using SWAT to quantify ecosystem services, to determine the model's capability examining various types of services, and to describe the approach used by various researchers. A literature review was conducted to identify studies in which SWAT was explicitly used for quantifying ecosystem services in terms of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural aspects. A total of 44 peer reviewed publications were identified. Most of these used SWAT to quantify provisioning services (34%), regulating services (27%), or a combination of both (25%). While studies using SWAT for evaluating ecosystem services are limited (approximately 1% of SWAT's peered review publications), and usage (vs. potential) of services by beneficiaries is a current model limitation, the available literature sets the stage for the continuous development and potential of SWAT as a methodological framework for quantifying ecosystem services to assist in decision-making.

AB  - Marine megafauna are critical for marine ecosystem health and their removal can cause food webs to collapse. Methods to reduce marine megafauna mortality can result in conflict between scientists, conservationists, fishers and fisheries management due to real or perceived effects on target catch, income and food security. Sensory deterrents have been used in attempts to mitigate bycatch and retain target catch quantity and quality. Here, we completed a systematic review of 116 papers, plus 25 literature reviews published between 1991 and 2022, to investigate potential for sensory deterrents to mitigate bycatch across four marine megafauna taxonomic groups (marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and elasmobranchs). Lights on gillnets are the only technology so far to result in significant bycatch reductions across all four taxonomic groups. It is difficult to make generalisations about the efficacy of sensory deterrents and their ability to deliver consistent bycatch reductions. The efficacy of each method is context dependent, varying with species, fishery and environmental characteristics. Further research is recommended for field studies assessing bycatch mitigation in all sensory deterrents, including combinations of deterrents, to assess effects on target and non-target species. The associated issues of habituation, habitat exclusion and foraging around fishing gear are important, although reducing mortality of vulnerable species should remain the highest priority for conservation and preserving ecosystems that fishers depend on. Multiple complementary measures will be required to achieve consistent bycatch reduction targets in many fisheries, of which sensory deterrents could play some part if implemented appropriately.

AB  - The literature concerning the evolution of the supply chain (SC) has highlighted that supply systems have undergone massive changes. The SC is a multi-objective system (economic, productive, strategic, environmental, social, etc.) crossed by a variety of flows (financial, material, information, technology, etc.). In such a complex system, the management of the processes of adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing and application of knowledge appears to be the necessary response to the new challenges posed to the SC by globalization and sustainability issues. This paper provides a systematic review of knowledge management (KM) in SCs in order to identify the state of the art in the literature, highlight research gaps, and define appropriate research questions to be addressed. To this end, eighty-two papers were selected and studied in detail. The paper shows that although there are a growing number of papers addressing KM in SC, many research issues are still neglected. In particular, the paper highlights eight main gaps in the SC literature. The first three gaps concern the factors affecting the adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing, and application of KM practices. The next three gaps address the systems to support knowledge management. The seventh gap considers the barriers to the adoption of KM practices. The eighth gap looks at.the impact of adoption of KM practices on performance. Starting from these eight gaps, nine research questions have been formulated. These research questions represent possible areas of investigation to improve the body of knowledge in the field of KM in SC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Male sexual dysfunctions (MSDs) often remain undiagnosed and untreated in Asia compared to Europe due to conservative cultural and religious beliefs, socioeconomic conditions, and lack of awareness. There is a tendency for the use of traditional medicines and noncompliance with and reduced access to modern healthcare. The present systematic review compared the incidence and factors of MSD in European and Asian populations. English language population/community-based original articles on MSDs published in MEDLINE from 2008 to 2018 were retrieved. A total of 5392 studies were retrieved, of which 50 (25 Asian and 25 European) were finally included in this review. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) (0%-95.0% vs. 0.9%-88.8%), low satisfaction (3.2%-37.6% vs. 4.1%-28.3%), and hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) (0.7%-81.4 vs. 0%-65.5%) was higher in Asian than in European men, whereas the prevalence of anorgasmia (0.4% vs. 3%-65%) was lower in Asian than in European men. Age was an independent positive factor of MSD. In European men over 60 years old, the prevalence of premature ejaculation (PE) decreased. The prevalence of MSD was higher in questionnaires than in interviews. The significant factors were age, single status, low socioeconomic status, poor general health, less physical activity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, lower urinary tract symptoms, prostatitis, anxiety, depression and alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. The prevalence of MSD differed slightly in Asian and European men. There is a need to conduct large studies on the various Asian populations for the effective management of MSD.

AB  - The rapid depletion of natural sources of energy, coupled with increasing global population has triggered the emergence of various techniques and strategies for building energy consumption prediction. According to information from existing body of knowledge, this paper systematically brings to fore the application areas of building energy consumption prediction (i.e. well-established and emerging), the relationships between these areas and the ways in which authors integrate the current spate of techniques. Based on direct implications of buildings on global energy consumption and CO2 emissions, this information makes it possible to identify trends, strengths and limitations in this context, thereby enabling the centralisation of activities required for future studies. This study follows several well-documented guides for conducting logical reviews of primary articles concerning main topics of building energy consumption prediction within popular online databases. The definition of articles' search keywords as well as inclusion/exemption factors were governed by a combination of principles stipulated by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews (PPSR). In comparison to existing review articles in the studied field, the current study is novel in the sense that it provides a very holistic view to building energy consumption prediction, thereby minimising the need to consult multiple individualised studies that are limited to specific techniques, data sets, regions or types of buildings. Another unique feature of this study is its interrelationship network of articles which depicts a quick glance at some of the most influential studies as well as under-represented areas, thereby aiding research planning, future directions and cross-disciplinary collaborations.

AB  - Green supply chain management (GSCM) has proven itself to be pivotal, including in the hospitality and hotel industries. Additionally, organizations cannot become eco-friendly without applying GSCM. Applying GSCM is very complicated due to the complex nature of the management relations with stakeholders involved and needs appropriate support and collaboration from all related parties in order to accomplish the wanted management results. This paper aimed to analyze and study the complicated roles and relations of GSCM and the hotel industry, identifying the main barriers that might be faced in its application and trying to present the full picture in a simple and comprehensive way in order to provide decision-makers with a wider vision. This can then be used to take the best actions. The analysis technique this study adopted to use to analyze the related scientific production was a systematic review technique. After the screening and cleaning processes, a total of 57 GSCM articles remained from the articles, which were extracted from scientific databases (WoS and Scopus) and analyzed using the three main levels of analysis groups. This study revealed that: (i) GSCM interferences and relations can be summarized into six main categories (external stakeholders, internal stakeholders, related management, the 4Rs, innovation and technology, and performance); (ii) the importance of GSCM goes beyond environmental objectives; and (iii) before applying GSCM practices, there are a number of primary barriers that should be considered regarding the hotel industry.

AB  - The success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends on solving the 'nexus' challenge: how can positive interactions between SDGs be optimised, and negative interactions minimised, in order to create co-benefits and reduce trade-offs? Due to their varying impacts on the SDGs, the economic activities undertaken by organisations present a key lever for operationalising this SDG-nexus. Yet the interactions between individual economic activities and the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development have not been systematically assessed, thus creating a vital operational bottleneck to achieving the SDGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of 876 articles published between 2005 and 2019 to study the nexus between individual economic activities, sustainable development in general, and the SDGs in specific. It finds that studies on agricultural, industrial, and manufacturing activities predominantly report negative impacts on environmental development, while literature on services activities highlight economic and social contributions. Overall, economic activities are expected to positively impact industrialisation, infrastructure, and innovation [SDG 9], economic productivity [SDG 8], housing and transport [SDG 11], energy [SDG 7], and waste management [SDG 6]. However, negative impacts are widespread, afflicting ecosystems [SDGs 14 and 15], climate change [SDG 13] and human health [SDG 3]. We synthesise positive and negative interactions between individual economic activities and SDG targets and discuss implications for: integrated (nexus) governance approaches to the SDGs; the role of the private sector in promoting sustainable development; and for improving statistical classifications to monitor economic activities' SDG impacts.

AB  - The agri-food market has shown a clear signal of "green" consumption that drives an increasing interest in studying consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for food products with environmentally sustainable attributes, such as eco-friendly and carbon neutral. Whilst many existing studies have focused on a general idea of green attributes or on-farm practices that are regarded to be most relevant to the attributes, the agri-food industry has started to address consumers' concerns about the negative environmental impacts of agri-food production across the whole supply chain, including the processing, transportation, and consumption process. It is therefore the purpose of this study to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on consumers' intentions of purchasing and WTP for food products with environmentally sustainable attributes, with a special interest in understanding the connections between consumer behaviours and different stages of the food supply chain. Results of the study revealed three main research gaps: the lack of clear definitions of environmentally sustainable attributes; ignorance of connections between the characteristics of environmentally sustainable attributes and different stages of the food supply chain; and lacking effective information processing among the key players along the supply chain, leading to inefficient communication between the supply and demand side. The findings of the study help form a conceptual framework for future studies to associate environmentally sustainable attributes to the whole food supply chain that helps the agri-food industry to effectively process market information, communicate with consumers, and satisfy the market demand.

AB  - Tallgrass prairie is among the most threatened ecosystems but is often fragmented and surrounded by human-modified landscapes. Small mammals are integral components of tallgrass prairies. However, little is known about how landscape composition, configuration, and management impact small mammals in tallgrass prairies.We conducted a systematic literature review to identify species-specific and community associations with three broad topics: landscape composition, landscape configuration, and management practices.We identified 61 studies that assessed our variables of interest. We categorised the location, species assessed, variables monitored, and results by species and for the community.The majority of studies (64%) were conducted in two states, Illinois and Kansas. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) showed specific associations with landscape variables, with deer mice preferring bare ground and recently burned plots, and prairie voles preferring thatch and negatively associated with prescribed fire. White-footed mice were frequently associated with wooded areas.Small mammal biodiversity was positively associated with patchy habitats containing greater diversity in vegetative composition and management regime. Management and land composition were both relatively well studied for several species; habitat configuration was understudied.We identified significant gaps in our understanding of small mammal landscape ecology in tallgrass prairies. With tallgrass prairie restoration a growing trend in this region, a greater understanding of drivers of small mammal populations will be crucial to successful restoration efforts. Future research should focus on understudied areas and species, and examine how habitat heterogeneity impacts small mammal biodiversity.
   A systematic review of the literature regarding small mammal habitat associations in tallgrass prairie identified both trends and gaps in our understanding. While well-studied species such as deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) have well-documented associations with cover type and management conditions, there are many understudied or cryptic species that are less well understood. Furthermore, much of the current literature on this topic originates from the same few research locations, with several states underrepresented or unrepresented in the literature at all.image

AB  - 1. The idea of which species are native, based on their biogeographic origin, is central to many policies and programmes. Yet definitions are contested and the meanings of 'nativeness' are often complex and confusing for many people. For example, a plant that would be considered 'native' in Australia might have a native bioregion that is thousands of kilometres from a given garden planting. The idea of nativeness is culturally constructed and connotes different meanings in different contexts. As conservation research and practice increasingly incorporate human values and behaviours, operationalising the social dimensions of abstract ecological concepts such as nativeness is needed to generate a more holistic evidence base and improve the management of native and non-native species.
   2. We used a sequential mixed-methods systematic review approach to review and synthesise literature on people's (including general publics, gardeners, conservationists) perceptions of nativeness of species and landscapes. A meta-synthesis of qualitative research identified six dimensions that underlie people's perceptions in relation to nativeness: Belonging (a sense that there is a right or wrong place for a species to exist); human influence (the role of humans in moving species outside of their historic ranges); functional compatibility (a species' alignment with the local environment and ecology); amenity (desirable and useful features provided by a species); negative impacts (risk and manageability of detrimental impacts caused by a species); and identity (species forming part of one's place-based identity).
   3. A systematic review of the quantitative urban literature found that most research on perceptions of native and non-native species and landscapes did not operationalise nativeness in a multidimensional way, focusing predominantly on the 'Negative impacts' dimension. This may often be inadequate for meaningfully capturing people's views.
   4. Our results also highlight the need to strengthen interdisciplinarity between natural and social sciences, and for better integration of social science theories to improve the interpretability and transferability of research findings.
   5. We provide recommendations for future research that operationalises nativeness using a broader range of meanings that will inform a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the human dimensions of conservation issues, especially within the contested and briskly evolving terrain of urban greening.

AB  - African large carnivores have undergone significant range and population declines over recent decades. Although conservation planning and the management of threatened species requires accurate assessments of population status and monitoring of trends, there is evidence that biodiversity monitoring may not be evenly distributed or occurring where most needed. Here, we provide the first systematic review of African large carnivore population assessments published over the last two decades (2000-2020), to investigate trends in research effort and identify knowledge gaps. We used generalised linear models (GLMs) and generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to identify taxonomic and geographical biases, and investigated biases associated with land use type and author nationality. Research effort was significantly biased towards lion (Panthera leo) and against striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena), despite the latter being the species with the widest continental range. African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) also exhibited a negative bias in research attention, although this was partly explained by its relatively restricted distribution. The number of country assessments for a species was significantly positively associated with its geographic range in that country. Population assessments were biased towards southern and eastern Africa, particularly South Africa and Kenya. Northern, western, and central Africa were generally under-represented. Most studies were carried out in photographic tourism protected areas under government management, while non-protected and trophy hunting areas received less attention. Outside South Africa, almost half of studies (41%) did not include authors from the study country, suggesting that significant opportunities exist for capacity building in range states. Overall, large parts of Africa remain under-represented in the literature, and opportunities exist for further research on most species and in most countries. We develop recommendations for actions aimed at overcoming the identified biases and provide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with priorities to help inform future research and monitoring agendas.

AB  - Windbreaks are an agroforestry practice used to provide simultaneous economic, environmental and social benefits that occur when trees are deliberately integrated into an agroecosystem. To date, no systematic review has been conducted on windbreak adoption in the U.S., which is needed to assess whether broader trends exist that may affect future research, extension delivery and policy development. This synthesis covers windbreak adoption studies in the U.S. from the earliest identified study in 1949 through 2020. A key finding from this synthesis is that producers use windbreaks on agricultural lands mostly for indirect economic benefits (soil erosion control, livestock protection, wind protection and snow control). This is followed by direct agricultural benefits (increased crop and livestock production) and intrinsic values (aesthetics and wildlife habitat). Direct economic benefits from forestry (timber and non-timber forest products) were often ranked last, despite most producers utilizing their windbreak trees for some economic gain. Windbreak satisfaction was also found to be high among U.S. producers (72-99%), with the beneficial functions varying by windbreak type (field, livestock, and farmstead). The main drivers causing producers to remove windbreaks were poor condition, age, and conflict with farming practices, while the primary reasons for non-adoption of windbreaks were lack of land and windbreak upkeep. Key information gaps needing further investigation include a greater understanding of producer-reported challenges and management activities associated with windbreak planting and maintenance, identifying and monetizing windbreak systems capable of producing marketable products, and valuation of ecosystem services provided by windbreaks over space and time and the potential for developing those markets.

AB  - Environmental justice (EJ) addresses the unequal distribution of environmental goods and harms and promotes people's right to be involved in environmental decision-making. In recent years, EJ considerations have expanded to the use of Nature-based solutions (NbS) in urban areas, mainly how their planning and imple-mentation can impact human well-being and social justice. However, what constitutes ajust solution and how the concept is treated in the literature can take many forms. This study reviews how EJ is conceptualised and analysed in urban NbS research and documents the potential outcomes of diverse interventions. We developed a conceptual framework for the review process, focusing on the EJ definitions transferable to NbS research. We then conducted a systematic review of 152 articles published between 2000 and 2021. Selected articles addressed urban NbS from the recognitional, procedural and distributional interpretations of justice. Publication trends, methods, and demographic variables were recorded for each article. Furthermore, we focused on the means for assessing EJ in empirical terms, such as the framing of justice-related challenges, assessment in-dicators, and the reported justice outcomes. Findings demonstrate the dominance of research themes, the skewness towards the distributive dimension of justice, and a large variety of metrics and indicators used to assess EJ implications. Our results also show that EJ outcomes have mostly been reported to be mixed or negative. The results are used to identify research gaps and issues that need to be addressed to enhance EJ effects in urban NbS.

AB  - Background: Semi-natural pastures are unfertilized grasslands with a long history of traditional low-input grazing management. This kind of pastures are recognized for their high species richness. However, as a consequence of modernization of agriculture, many of the semi-natural pastures have been lost during the last century, leading to a serious threat to farmland biodiversity. Semi-natural pastures are relatively low in productivity. Hence, to increase profitability, farmers may want to give the grazing animals access to additional nutrient sources. This can be done either as supplementary feeding, or by fencing the semi-natural pastures into the same enclosure as improved, more nutrient-rich, pastures. These practices are, however, controversial. It is argued that since semi-natural pastures are species-rich partly because they are nutrient-poor, introducing additional nutrients into the system should be avoided. Accordingly, in Sweden, these interventions are often prohibited while receiving financial subsidies for management of semi-natural pastures. However, since many farmers are dependent on such support to maintain their pastures, these prohibitions often cause problems. The question has been raised whether giving the grazers access to additional nutrient sources really affect the biodiversity in semi-natural pastures, as is assumed. The primary aim of the proposed systematic review is to answer this question.
   Method: Peer-reviewed and grey literature will be searched for using bibliographic databases, search engines, specialist websites and stakeholder contacts. The references will be screened for relevance according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. The criteria will be tested and clarified iteratively, until consistency in interpretations is achieved. Thereafter, the literature will be screened in two stages, first based upon title and abstract and then by examining full texts. Full text screening will be performed with blinded decisions by two independent reviewers. Each relevant study will then be critically appraised, based on a set of predefined validity criteria. A narrative synthesis will be provided, outlining the evidence base in terms of bibliographic information and study metadata. If possible, quantitative syntheses based on meta-analyses will be performed. Identified relevant knowledge gaps will be highlighted and discussed.

AB  - Humpback dolphins (Sousa spp.), throughout their distribution ranges, are often designated as flagship species for coastal ecosystem conservation. Most of the early research on humpback dolphins was carried out in Chinese waters, and in the last two decades, numerous studies have provided abundant conservation-valuable findings.In this study, a systematic review was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the distributional ecology of humpback dolphins in Chinese waters, to establish an updated national knowledge base about key conservation baselines on this flagship species.Currently, there are at least eight main distribution areas of humpback dolphins along the coast of southern China, representing a clear picture of place-based conservation units. However, the overall biogeographical distribution pattern is discontinuous, and existing marine protected areas are far from sufficient to protect these key areas for the survival of humpback dolphins.Based on the photo-identification technique, cross-matching of humpback dolphin individuals revealed extremely low inter-population connectivity among most of the known populations. Genetic studies suggested that several examined populations have low haplotype diversity levels, with limited inter-population gene flow. Morphological and behavioural evidence also supports population differentiation among geographical locations.These findings provide key baselines for the promotion of conservation management initiatives for humpback dolphins in Chinese waters. All recognizable geographical populations, together with each key habitat, should be considered as independent conservation units. With small distribution areas, low genetic diversity and unfavourable geographical isolation, several populations may be at a high risk of regional extinction.A country-led scheme with cross-regional collaboration is required for science-based, action-focused and timely conservation efforts. Future conservation management initiatives should aim to increase or at least maintain key habitats, inter-population connectivity, population-level genetic diversity and effective population size.

AB  - Urban planning and design can impact mental health, but it is unclear how ever-growing and changing cities can sustain the psychological wellbeing of vulnerable groups, who are among the most mentally sensitive to spatial inequalities. This systematic review synthesised quantitative and qualitative studies on urban design interventions and their impact on wellbeing in vulnerable groups. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched five online databases from inception to May 2020. A total of 10 papers were included. We found mixed evidence of benefits for wellbeing linked to urban regeneration projects or focused interventions (green spaces, transport, security). Interventions that were centred around participation, sustainable living, and quality of design (e.g., perceived sense of safety) were associated with increased residential satisfaction and wellbeing, particularly among low-income communities and women. Risk of bias was low to medium, but there was high methodological heterogeneity; studies were mainly from Western countries, and none of the included studies investigated the experiences of people with disabilities, migrants, or racial minorities. This review highlights the importance of inclusive and sustainable design interventions to create happy places for all strata of society, although further investigation is warranted.

AB  - Integrated coastal and marine management (ICM) holds considerable promise for addressing gaps in conventional sector-based approaches to the management of coastal and marine areas. Progress in operationalizing ICM has been hindered by a lack of appropriate governance arrangements (e.g., mechanisms for making collective decisions about the use and management of coastal systems). This paper develops a framework for analyzing ICM governance based upon a preliminary scoping review, and uses the framework to conduct a structured systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on ICM between 2010 and 2019 (n = 69). Results suggest that coastal stakeholders have struggled to fully operationalize ICM across many contexts, and that certain characteristics appear to enhance prospects for operationalizing ICM. These include formal governance structures, engagement with diverse actors and innovative mechanisms for coordination and cooperation among multi-actor groups. The paper concludes by revising the ICM framework, based upon the relative importance of topics discussed in the literature, with particular attention to monitoring, evaluation and adaptation stages. The resulting Elements and Characteristics of ICM framework summarizes the state of the field while providing a practical resource for planning and management.

AB  - The offshore wind industry is expanding rapidly around the world due to several factors enabling this source of renewable energy. Stronger wind resources in offshore areas, lack of social and geographical constraints related to onshore wind power, the evolution of technology, and increasing demand for electricity in coastal regions as a result of a massive increase in population are some of the factors favoring the use of wind energy. The assessment of the potential global capacity that considers the different economic, environmental, and social factors and the dynamics of market, policy, and technology are vital for estimating the competitiveness of offshore wind energy in the future energy profile. There are several studies and technical reports that evaluate the potential of offshore wind energy in different countries or regions. They used a different source of data, metrics, and quantitative approaches in appraising the potential offshore wind power capacity and its cost efficiency. The critical factors that have been considered are geographical, technical, economic, environmental, and social and market elements. This paper provides a systematic review for analyzing the studies that address the potential offshore wind energy around the world and published during the 2000-2016 period. This study highlights the key criteria for assessing the potential for offshore wind energy deployment and the related tools and methods. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB  - CONTEXT: Deferred cord clamping (DCC) saves lives. It reduces extremely preterm infants' mortality by 30%, yet a minority of eligible infants receive it. This may in part be due to lack of awareness or confidence in evidence, or conflicting or vague guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review clinical practice guidelines and other statements on DCC and cord milking. DATA SOURCES: Ten academic and guideline databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical practice guidelines and other statements (position statements and consensus statements) providing at least 1 recommendation on DCC or umbilical cord milking among preterm or term infants were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from included statements were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Guideline quality was appraised with modified Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Recommendation Excellence tools. RESULTS: Forty-four statements from 35 organizations were included. All endorsed DCC for uncompromised preterm infants, and 11 cautiously stated that cord milking may be considered when DCC is infeasible. Only half (49%) of the recommendations on the optimal duration of DCC were supported by high-quality evidence. Only 8% of statements cited a mortality benefit of DCC for preterm infants. LIMITATIONS: Because systematic reviews of guidelines are relatively novel, there are few tools to inform study execution; however, we used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Recommendation Excellence to assess quality and were methodologically informed by previous systematic reviews of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Statements worldwide clearly encouraged DCC. Their implementability would benefit from noting the preterm mortality benefit of DCC and more granularity.
   In reviewing 44 guidelines, we found worldwide endorsement for DCC and heterogeneity in key areas, including the optimal duration to defer clamping.

AB  - A scientific consensus has recently emerged suggesting that the dominant twentieth century paradigm of solving transportation congestion problems by building more freeways failed. The legacy of the freeway construction era is clearly visible in polluted and congested cities worldwide. To battle these ills, planning academics have been promoting more sustainable built form aligned with dedicated public/active transport provision. Partly as a result of the push coming from academia, a number of cities have sought to remove their freeways and replace the freed up space with alternate transport infrastructure, such as streets and boulevards. To discern if the transportation planning profession is currently undergoing a paradigm shift or whether freeway removal is merely a temporary fad, we have conducted a systematic review of the literature. In this article, we unpack the underlying reasons which have led some cities to removing their freeways. Results reveal that a paradigm shift has arguably not yet taken place in transportation planning. While many cities are creating human-scale and active transport spaces, currently these spaces tend to coexist alongside freeways. American cities, which were once the pioneers of freeway construction, appear to be lagging behind cities in Europe and Asia in this respect. If the current pace of freeway removal continues, it may take a few decades before the transportation planners, politicians, policy makers, and communities adopt radically different norms, methods, and goals. However, a radical approach may need to be taken sooner given alarming global warming predictions.

AB  - Green human resources management (GHRM) has proven its efficiency in many industries and services, including the hospitality and hostel industries. Additionally, applying green human resources management practices reflects an organization's environmental awareness and responsibilities. Given that the adoption of these practices cannot be accomplished without the appropriate support from decision makers, the aim of this paper is to analyze the relationships between green human resources management and the hotel industry, identify the possible barriers they may face and provide decision makers with the ability to choose the appropriate combination of GHRM practices based on an understanding the full picture presented in this study. This study depended on a systematic review technique to analyze the scientific production in this area. A total of 59 GHRM articles were extracted from Scopus and WoS and analyzed using three primary levels of analysis. This study revealed that: (i) Green human resources management practices can be summarized into four main categories (employees, marketing systems and corporate social responsibility, leadership and management, and organizational behavior and culture); (ii) the importance of green human resources management goes beyond environmental objectives; and (iii) there are significant barriers that should be taken into consideration when applying GHRM practices in the hotel industry.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Voluntary sustainability standards (VSSs) precede the SDGs and are a major governance tool for sustainability. Consequently, it is important to understand the role of VSS towards the achievement of the SDGs. This article contributes to answer this question through a systematic review of literature. Results revealed research gaps for key SDGs, such as SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Another relevant finding is that more than half of the studied variables showed no significant difference between intervention or control group, or no significant change over time. This article encourages VSSs and policymakers to work collaboratively towards the use of common indicators and increased data transparency.

AB  - The technologies of the Cellular Age are opening new roads to sustainable development. The aim is to create products with less environmental impact and to make tools and processes in line with this requirement. For this reason, a project was set up using the starting points of material recyclability, reduction or elimination of harmful substances and systematic mapping of materials. In addition, recycling and end-of-life treatment of components were included in parts selection criteria. This meant a systematic approach to enable the integration of environmental considerations in product creation and process design.
   At the outset, targets for DfE implementation were set. The primary objectives were a detailed definition of material balance, identification of harmful materials and their replacement through redesign, a careful analysis of components recyclability, design for easy disassembly, and definition and optimization of costs at the EoL stage.
   Significant gains have been made in DfE tools and processes, in methodologies, in the preparation of directions for environmentally conscious design and in the development Of metrics, i.e. coinpany-internal benchmarking. Nevertheless, to ensure continuous improvement, environmental reporting must be developed in line with the product creation project, as will be shown in this presentation.
   The results amply prove the advances made in implementing a holistic environmental management, in mapping out materials used in the product, in reducing the amount Of harmful substances and in circulating materials by adopting corresponding product design. In addition, the importance of holistic design principles for the reduction and minimization of harmful environmental impact and for the optimization of recycling costs are stressed.
   The conclusion supports Nokia in its attempts to create environmentally sustainable products in cooperation with supply line management, to implement such principles when making products on a global scale and to optimize product life cycle and end-of-life management in a cost-effective way.

AB  - Globally, indigenous knowledge (IK) has been shown to be a critical factor in economic growth and sustainable development and is as important as scientific knowledge. However, when it comes to the African narrative, IK research still seems to fall short, even with the great recognition and interest it is attracting. IK has always been underprivileged and marginalized, treated as an unsubstantiated type of knowledge that cannot provide any scientific solutions. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to provide an insight into the importance of IK research from a comparative African perspective from 1990 to 2020. The paper used a combination of bibliometric analysis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to provide a comprehensive view of IK research. The VOSviewer software was used to provide a visualization of the bibliometric analysis through network maps. The findings suggest that while IK is a globally recognized concept, the African narrative is missing and not told by Africans. Most researched studies on IK in Africa are on ethnobotany, customs, traditions, agroforestry, and agriculture. Moreover, most of the IK research is from Southern Africa. There is a need for the integration of IK and scientific knowledge to develop well-informed approaches, methodologies, and frameworks that cater to indigenous communities and resilient ecological development. The research outcomes provide valuable insights for future research trends; they further highlight opportunities for building research partnerships for strengthening policy generation and implementation.

AB  - Consumer's attitudes to, and acceptance of, emerging technologies and their applications, are important determinants of their successful implementation and commercialisation. Understanding the range of socio-psychological, cultural and affective factors which may influence consumer responses to applications of nanotechnology will help "fine-tune'' the development of consumer products in line with their expectations and preferences. This is particularly true of applications in the food area, where consumer concerns about technologies applied to food production may be elevated. This research applied systematic review methodology to synthesise current knowledge regarding societal acceptance or rejection of nanotechnology applied to agri-food production. The objective was to aggregate knowledge derived from different research areas to gain an overall picture of consumer responses to nanotechnology applied to food production. Relevant electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature were searched from the earliest date available, for peer-reviewed papers which reported primary empirical data on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology, using a formal systematic review protocol. Inclusion criteria for papers to be included in the review were: empirical peer-reviewed papers written in English; a population sample of adults aged 18 years and over used in the research; a research focus on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology; and research on attitudes towards, and willingness to pay for, different applications of agrifood nanotechnology. Two researchers independently appraised the papers using NVivo 10 QSR software. Studies examining consumer and expert acceptance were thematically analysed, and key information was collated. The results were synthesised in order to identify trends in information relevant to consumer acceptance of nanotechnology applied to food production. Eight key themes were identified from the 32 papers which were extracted from the literature. These themes were applied to understand the determinants of consumer acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is more likely to be accepted by consumers when applied to development of novel packaging with distinct benefits rather than when integrated directly into agri-food products. Trust and confidence in agri-food nanotechnology and its governance need to be fostered through transparent regulation and development of societally beneficial impacts to increase consumer acceptance.

AB  - Introduction: Single disease state led evidence-based guidelines do not provide sufficient coverage of issues of multimorbidities, with the cumulative impact of recommendations often resulting in overwhelming medicines burden. Inappropriate polypharmacy increases the likelihood of adverse drug events, drug interactions and non-adherence.
   Areas covered: A detailed description of a pan-European initiative, 'Stimulating Innovation Management of Polypharmacy and Adherence in the Elderly, SIMPATHY', which is a project funded by the European Commission to support innovation across the European Union. This includes a systematic review of the literature aiming to summarize and review critically current policies and guidelines on polypharmacy management in older people. The policy driven, evidence-based approach to managing inappropriate polypharmacy in Scotland is described, with consideration of a change management strategy based on Kotter's eight step process for leading sustainable change.
   Expert opinion: The challenges around promoting appropriate polypharmacy are on many levels, primarily clinical, organisational and political, all of which any workable solution will need to address. To be effective, safe and efficient, any programme that attempts to deal with the complexities of prescribing in this population must be patient-centred, clinically robust, multidisciplinary and designed to fit into the healthcare system in which it is delivered.

AB  - Rhodolith beds are benthic biogenic calcareous habitats formed by the aggregation of unattached, non-geniculate coralline algae. They have a worldwide distribution and, due to their 3D structural complexity and functioning, they provide several ecosystem services (i.e., provisioning and regulating). Recently, their importance and vulnerability have been internationally recognized by international policy and scientific research, and more attention has been drawn to their investigation and conservation. In this study, we conducted a systematic review integrated with a bibliometric analysis of the academic literature related to rhodolith beds. The analysis was based on published literature data over the period 1965-2022, and allowed the generation of maps based on network data displaying the relationships among countries, researchers, keywords, and scientific journals. A total of 853 publications were identified, revealing that scientific research on rhodolith beds is still relatively limited if compared to other coastal vegetated habitats (e.g., seagrass beds, kelp forests), although it has increased over time. Results showed that the scientific documents were published by 77 countries, 2255 researchers, and 279 journals. USA led the research production in this field with 159 documents and 4802 citations, and Amado-Filho was the most productive author with 36 documents and 1126 citations. The co-occurrence network map of keywords showed that the main research fields linked to rhodolith beds are geology, paleontology, algal tax-onomy, community ecology, conservation, and physiology. The results also highlighted that most focus on the subject is recently shifting from geological and paleontological aspects to molecular taxonomic, conservation, and ecophysiological ones, while studies on the current topics of ecosystem services and carbon sequestration are still very limited.

AB  - This document presents a systematic review of Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction. It shows how different types of interaction technologies (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality, force and vibration feedback devices (haptics), and tracking) are used in different domains (concepts, medicine, physics, human factors/user experience design, transportation, cultural heritage, and industry). A systematic literature search was conducted identifying 406 articles initially. From these articles, we selected 112 research works that we consider most relevant for the content of this article. The articles were analyzed in-depth from the viewpoint of temporal patterns, frequency of usage in types of technology in different domains, and cluster analysis. The analysis allowed us to answer relevant questions in searching for the next steps in work related to multimodal HCI. We looked at the typical technology type, how the technology type and frequency have changed in time over each domain, and how papers are grouped across metrics given their similarities. This analysis determined that VR and haptics are the most widely used in all domains. While VR is the most used, haptic interaction is presented in an increasing number of applications, suggesting future work on applications that configure VR and haptic together.

AB  - This study aimed to determine if implemented donor-funded health related-programs in Africa were sustained beyond the funding lifecycle and determine their facilitators and impeders. A systematic review was conducted after the documentation of a study protocol. A database search was done across three databases namely Google Scholar, PubMed, and Medline between January 27 and February 15, 2022. All peer-reviewed articles on sustainability of health interventions in Africa published between 2015 and 2021 that provided one or more context-relevant definitions of sustainability were included. Publications with no use of quantitative or qualitative methods and studies with no information on project evaluation after initial implementation were excluded. Screening of titles and abstracts was done, and the full texts of all relevant articles were retrieved. The risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the systematic review. Overall, 4,876 articles were retrieved, and only nine articles were eligible for inclusion in the review following the removal of duplicates. Overall, sustainability was described in only three of the five regions in Africa. Donor-funded projects were sustained beyond the funding lifecycle in seven (77.8%) studies. Facilitators of sustainability in Africa included community ownership of the project through the engagement of community stakeholders in the design and implementation of such projects, use of locally available resources, sound infrastructure, and the constitution of interdisciplinary team to facilitate capacity building. Impeders to the sustainability of donor-funded projects included weak health systems exemplified in poor documentation and integration of records, lack of financial leadership, shortage of resources, political interference, poor feedback mechanism, and weak donor-community interactions. From the ROBIS tool, a low risk of bias existed in the studies included in the review. Although the included studies appropriately considered the review's research question, seven studies had a low risk of bias in the domains one to three, and two studies had high risk of bias in domain four. To derive maximum benefits from donor-funded health interventions, sustainability of such projects is key. During program planning phase, context-based facilitators of sustainability should he promoted, while impeders are immediately addressed.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are important shallow coastal ecosystems due to their contribution to enhancing biodiversity, nu-trient cycling, carbon burial, and sediment stabilisation, but the maintenance of their integrity has been threatened by several anthropogenic disturbances. Active restoration is considered a reliable strategy to enhance recovery of seagrass ecosystems, and decision making for correct seagrass restoration management requires relying on valuable informa-tion regarding the effectiveness of past restoration actions and experimental efforts.Previous experimental efforts and human-mediated active restoration actions of the slow growing seagrass Posidonia oceanica have been collated here by combining a literature systematic review and questionnaires consulting seagrass ecol-ogy experts. Overall, the poor consistency of the available information on P. oceanica restoration may be due to the wide portfolio of practices and methodologies used in different conditions, that supports the need of further field manipulative experiments in various environmental contexts to fill the identified knowledge gaps. The current situation requires an in-ternational, collaborative effort from scientists and stakeholders to jointly design the future strategy forward in identify-ing the best practices that lead to efficient restorations of P. oceanica habitat and functioning.

AB  - Background: Use of the minimally invasive Ponseti method has been increasing in low and middle-income countries, where most of the world's children with clubfoot are born. This method requires a system of service delivery involving screening, serial casting with or without a tenotomy to achieve correction, and long-term use of an orthosis to maintain correction. The goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the barriers to service delivery and the solutions that have been proposed or implemented to address these barriers.
   Methods: A literature search of Medline, Embase, and SCOPUS produced 3251 results. Twenty-four papers were selected for final review. Barriers and their attempted solutions were organized into a previously described health barrier model. We reported on high-impact, sustainable solutions that are feasible for organizations to implement, as opposed to solutions that require major policy or country-wide infrastructure changes.
   Results: Common barriers found to have the most impact on patient care included financial constraints, transportation, difficulties with brace and cast care, self-perceived health status, lack of physical resources, and provider's lack of knowledge and skill. The most common solutions detailed were education of the provider or patient and financial assistance for patients.
   Conclusions: Recognizing that contextually relevant solutions to the challenges of setting up a system for clubfoot service delivery are required, several common barriers have emerged within this systematic review of papers from multiple countries, including spatial accessibility, affordability, and availability. Programs can best prepare for challenges by placing clinics close to population centers and/or allocating funds to subsidize transportation, ensuring that an adequate supply of materials are available for the casting and tenotomy, and enhancing the education of families and health providers. Strengthening communication and establishing partnerships between individuals and organizations promoting the Ponseti method will improve systems for service delivery.
   Level of Evidence: Level IV-prognostic study.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the importance of management in the health care sector. Positive correlations have been found between clinical and economic performance. Although there is still controversy regarding what kind of management and which managers should lead health care organizations and health systems, we now have interesting evidence to analyze. Starting with a systematic review of the literature, this article presents and discusses the streams of knowledge regarding how management can influence the quality and sustainability of health systems and organizations. Through the analysis of 37 studies, we found that the performance of health care systems and organizations seems to be correlated with management practices, leadership, manager characteristics, and cultural attributes that are associated with managerial values and approaches. There is also evidence that health care organizations run by doctors perform better than others. Finally, we provide a roadmap that indicates how the relationship between the management and performance of health systems and organizations can be further and more effectively investigated.

AB  - Bioenergy buffers are linear landscape elements cultivated with perennial herbaceous or woody biomass crops placed along arable field margins and watercourses. This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.

AB  - New planning approaches based on performance measures of the urban system are emerging to face the current challenges to the sustainability of cities. Through modelling, planners can understand the general behavior of the system and, consequently, decide the strategic allocation of land uses and human activities with respect to performances of the considered processes and the socio-ecological and economic uncertainties. Thus, model-based planning approaches present strong similarities with the performance-based planning (PBP) approaches and modelling can represent a valuable tool for the evolution and expansion of PBP. In this paper, a systematic review has explored a) the contribution of modelling within PBP approaches in moving cities towards sustainability; b) the applicability for modeling in PBP in urban contexts. Twelve operational examples of model-based urban planning and PBP have been identified in energy, water infrastructure, land use and ecological planning areas. A scoring system for potential model applicability in urban planning was tested in the sampled case studies. Moreover, several critical elements in the relation between modeling approaches and PBP have been identified. Finally, a discussion on the system performance concept as a new urban planning paradigm has been proposed.

AB  - Dry rivers (DR) are a non-perennial type of river that flows for only hours or a few days, primarily after heavy rain that often causes flash floods. Unlike intermittent and ephemeral rivers, they are disconnected from groundwater and do not support aquatic life. DR have often been undervalued by some scientific and social groups in terms of nature's contributions to people (NCP) because of the lack of an integrative perspective to encompass them and their high aridity and low flow. This study aims to provide the state of the art on DR in terms of geographic distribution, NCP, human well-being and drivers of change, and to identify knowledge gaps and the tools to bridge them. To this end, a systematic review of 79 scientific documents (26 case studies, 53 evidence-based works) published between 1995 and 2019 was conducted. Firstly, we analysed the main research trends using publication rates and bibliometric techniques. Secondly, we analysed DR distribution, NCP and drivers of change using mapping techniques, descriptive statistics and bibliographic analysis respectively. We especially identified regulating NCP but to a lesser extent, also material and non-material NCP affected by land use change, climate change, overexploitation, and demographic, political and economic changes. We found relevant gaps on NCP and how they affect the different components of well-being, and the effect of indirect drivers of change on them. Geographical information systems, international scientific collaboration, and basin and transdisciplinary approaches, could accelerate bridging gaps while new research, rehabilitation, management and conservation, and socio-economic opportunities are developed in parallel.

AB  - Background: Shoreline works include any unnatural alteration or human intervention to coastal areas such as infilling, armouring, aquatic vegetation removal or planting, actions altering coastal processes, embayment creation, etc. The Fisheries Act requires that projects avoid causing serious harm to fish unless authorized by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. This currently applies to work in or near water bodies that support or are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery. The Fisheries Protection Program, a decision-making body regulating the sustainability and ongoing productivity of these fisheries, utilizes various metrics of fish productivity to determine serious harm. The goal of this systematic review is to assess the type of shoreline alteration and their reported effects on fish productivity outcomes relevant to the temperate regions of Canada. The primary goal is to answer the question "how do the characteristics of shoreline works/alteration activities affect temperate fish productivity?" This review will assist Fisheries and Oceans Canada in determining future information needs, developing standards for evaluating serious harm, and providing an evidence base for decision making. Furthermore, this review will also result in a database that will provide access to information relevant for determining the impacts of shoreline alteration on fish communities.
   Methods: We will conduct a systematic search using multiple online scientific and government databases as well as specialist sites to gather literature relevant to the temperate region of Canada that examines the impacts of shoreline alteration and development on fish productivity. We will consider studies globally, but will focus our research on those that include freshwater, or estuarine environments that have a coastal impact. Study data will be extracted and appraised for quality and compiled for a meta-analysis to be completed should the available data be adequate to do so. Relevant research outcomes will be evaluated by a range of measures used by authors to define productivity and its surrogates, including but not limited to fish yield, abundance, recruitment, body size, community index, species richness or diversity, and species density. Effect size and magnitude, frequency and duration data from the relevant studies will be extracted and assessed through a meta-analysis to quantify or estimate the overall effects of shoreline alteration and development types on fish productivity. The impact of habitat alteration magnitude (e.g. project size, project duration) and fish population and community characteristics (e.g. fish taxonomy, thermal or habitat preferences) on effect size will also be assessed using sub-group analyses.

AB  - Regenerative agriculture (RA) is an approach to farming pursued globally for sustaining agricultural production and improving ecosystem services and environmental benefits. However, the lack of a standardized definition and limited bioeconomic assessments hinder the understanding and application of RA more broadly. An initial systematic review revealed a wide range of definitions for regenerative agriculture, although it is generally understood as a framework consisting of principles, practices, or outcomes aimed at improving soil health, biodiversity, climate resilience, and ecosystem function. To address existing gaps, we propose a working definition that integrates socioeconomic outcomes and acknowledges the significance of local knowledge and context to complement established scientific knowledge. A second systematic review identified indicators, tools, and models for assessing biophysical and economic aspects of RA. Additionally, a third literature review aimed to identify the potential integration of advanced analytical methods into future assessments, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Finally, as a case study, we developed a conceptual framework for the evaluation of the bioeconomic outcomes of RA in the mixed farming setting in Australia. This framework advocates a transdisciplinary approach, promoting a comprehensive assessment of RA outcomes through collaboration, integrated data, holistic frameworks, and stakeholder engagement. By defining, evaluating assessment methods, and proposing a pragmatic framework, this review advances the understanding of RA and guides future research to assess the fit of RA practices to defined contexts.

AB  - There have been increasing calls for a paradigm shift in urban water management to a water sensitive cities (WSC) approach. Although it is well recognised that development of water sensitive communities is key to sustainable urban water transitions, there is no established definition for the "water sensitive community." This study conducts a systematic review to understand how water sensitive communities are characterised in the literature and applies a complex adaptive systems perspective to the findings. The review identifies 16 attributes that define water sensitive communities, involving elements of participation, collaboration, liveability, shared ownership and responsibility in transition processes, and resilience. We add to this by linking WSC research with complex adaptive systems theory and propose a new definition of the water sensitive community as a complex adaptive system. This presents a realistic framework in which to study the complex interactions and dynamic aspects of a water sensitive community.

AB  - Growing social awareness of the need to adequately treat mining waste in order to protect the environment has led to an increase in the research in this field. The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of the research focused on mining waste and its sustainable management on a worldwide scale from 1988 to 2017. A systematic review and a bibliometric analysis of 3577 articles were completed. The results show that research into mining waste has increased, with studies focusing on waste management accounting for almost 40% of the total. The most productive journals in this field were Applied Geochemistry and Science of the Total Environment. The five most productive countries were the United States, Canada, Spain, Australia, and China. Works on the sustainable management of mining waste were in the minority, but it is an area of research that has considerable potential given the growing social awareness of the environmental repercussions of mining activities and the demands for increasingly sustainable practices. The findings of this study could prove useful for studies into mine waste, as they depict a global view of this line of research.

AB  - This article evaluates if the increasing use of the term urban transformations in academic research and the widely acknowledged importance of cities in sustainability transformations has led to a transformative turn towards sustainability and Global Environmental Change (GEC) in urban-related studies. This is done through a systematic review of the scientific literature on urban transformations for the last six decades. This way, the multiplicity of uses of the term urban transformations is identified and a contextualization of the urban transformations to sustainability-debate within the wider sphere of urban-related studies is achieved. Our findings show that until now the term is very heterogeneously used in the scientific literature and that the number of articles referring to urban transformations to sustainability has significantly increased during the last five years. While first steps towards a transformative turn can be identified, empirical cases of successful urban transformations towards sustainability hardly appear in the articles. A gap between the theoretical concept and the empirical cases of urban transformations is clearly visible, which also has implications for future research on urban sustainability.

AB  - Transit Oriented Development (TOD) encourages densification around transport nodes with a combination of work, educational facilities, commercial activities and other essential services. Implementing TOD in Ghana would, however, be faced with several challenges. The systematic review approach, which is based on published scholarly works was adopted. The paper aimed at exploring the significant characteristics, benefits, as well as the institutional and operational challenges of TOD in Accra. The paper identified the possible benefits of TOD in Accra to include a reduction in motorisation and congestion, promotion of walkability and other forms of non-motorised transport. It will also promote public transit ridership and improvement in the liveability of neighbourhoods. The challenges that would be associated with the implementation of TOD in Accra include the absence of a clear policy initiative of the concept in Ghanaian cities; inadequate budgetary support for strategic urban land use planning and development control; the existence of different ownership regimes within a sizeable stretch of land; and the existence of an ill-planned urban transportation system. Policy options suggested included a new housing policy that will encourage densification, mixed-income housing schemes with stronger government-private and sustainable financing schemes; and a planning regime that integrates transportation, land use and housing development.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution is the primary cause of reduced water quality in the United States. This pollution results primarily from fertilizer and manure application in farmland. One of the hydrological models most widely used to predict the effect of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application on nutrient loadings is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). While important advances have been made to improve the representation of biophysical processes within SWAT, modelers often fail to capture the complexity of human land management behaviors. Meanwhile, decades of social science research have demonstrated that farmers are not a homogeneous group, but rather exhibit complex and diverse behaviors. In this paper we present a systematic review of recently published papers that use SWAT to document how the modeling community typically represents fertilizer application behaviors. We compare these representations with findings from recent farmer surveys that captured information about fertilizer application rates. We found that most SWAT model applications assume that farmer field management behaviors are relatively homogeneous (e.g., all farmers behave in the same way), and that farmers generally apply fertilizer using rational agronomic or economic criteria. These simplifying assumptions conflict with the reality of farmers' fertilizer behavior. Farmer surveys in Minnesota and Ohio show considerable variability in N and P fertilizer application rates on corn (Zea mays L.) fields following soybeans (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). The disconnect between SWAT modeling approaches and results of farmer surveys point to opportunities to better represent the heterogeneity of farmers' fertilizer behavior in SWAT and other hydrologic models, which could improve our ability to link changes in land use and management to water quality and increase the effectiveness of conservation program interventions.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this systematic review was to describe what is known about the diabetes disparity affecting Puerto Rican identified adults living in the continental United States as well as illuminate areas that merit further investigation.
   Methods
   The CINAHL and PubMed databases were searched using the keywords Hispanic, Puerto Rican, and type 2 diabetes. Search limits included < 10-year-old, peer-reviewed, systematic reviews, available in the English language. The abstracts of 124 articles were reviewed, and 7 articles were reviewed in depth.
   Results
   The Puerto Rican identified Hispanic subgroup is disproportionately affected by diabetes-the diabetes disparity. Puerto Rican identified Hispanic adults are less affected by citizenship status, may be less affected by English proficiency, use health care services differently, and have contextually different fatalistic views of diabetes compared with other Hispanic identified people. Spiritual/ religious influences, associated mental health problems, and general cultural practices related to diabetes self-care are understudied in this group.
   Conclusion
   Ambiguous use of the term Hispanic should be avoided when describing Hispanic subgroups. Stronger, more robust studies are needed to understand the unique cultural forces influencing the poor diabetes outcomes and individual behaviors that contribute to generally suboptimal diabetes self-care for Puerto Rican adults with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - This study aimed to identify from the literature review whether agroforestry systems have been an agricultural practice adopted by indigenous peoples for income generation and food and nutritional security. For this, a systematic review was conducted in the period from 2010 to 2020 of 92 articles, dissertations, and theses. Thus, it is found that agroforestry practices are traditional indigenous forms of farming that provide food security, income generation, and medicines, in addition to preserving biodiversity. Indigenous agroforestry is fundamental to indigenous culture, strengthening spiritual practices and the relationship with nature. Women have vital importance in the management of agroforestry practices because, through this productive practice, they ensure the food consumption of the family, besides generating income. However, women still face many difficulties in the countryside because their working hours are longer than those of men; besides not participating in decisions on the choice of species and form of management, in some countries, they still face difficulty accessing and owning land. The studies provide evidence on the economic viability of agroforestry systems. However, research gaps are identified that verify the economic and financial analysis of agroforestry models, which address the concerns of indigenous communities, aiming at food security. These analyses are essential for the implementation and continuity of the production system.

AB  - Mass movements are one of the main causes of loss of people and environmental assets. Several factors contribute to mass movements, such as terrain morphology, rainfall regime, soil properties, land use and occupation. Studies showed that in the Northeast region of Brazil, between the years of 1991 and 2012, 38 events related to mass movements were recorded, resulting in 55,963,164 people affected by these events. Based on this information, the aim of this study was to build a systematic review of mass movement and erosion events that occurred in the northeast region of Brazil and were reported in Brazilian academic sources. The research was based on the articles published by the Soils and Rocks Journal and the proceedings of the Brazilian academic events: Brazilian Congress of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, the Brazilian Conference on Slope Stability and the Brazilian Congress of Engineering and Environmental Geology. A survey of all the articles involving the subject matter was conducted between the years of 1954 and 2019 using the key words Landslides, Mass Movements, Geomorphology and Engineering Geology. From the data found, it was possible to identify the main geotechnical characteristics of mass movement occurrences in the region and their causes.

AB  - Agriculture in South Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing variability in rainfall and rising temperatures leading to the incidence of extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, heat/cold waves, and storms. Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation.

AB  - The MesoHABitat SImulation Model (MesoHABSIM) is the preferred method to calculate spatio-temporal variation in the fish habitat availability in Italian rivers. With the aim of improving the applicability of the MesoHABSIM approach in the Italian territory, we carried out a systematic review of physical habitat preferences for 31 freshwater fish species and three freshwater lampreys, representing 75% of the total indigenous freshwater fish community of Italy. Information related to suitable ranges of depth, flow velocity, biotic/abiotic substrates, covers/shelters was collected and summarized for two critical life stages (adult and juvenile) and two bioperiods (rearing/growth and spawning). Overall, 250 publications were reviewed, classified as 206 peer-reviewed papers, 20 books, 7 PhD thesis, and 17 grey literature sources. Our analysis revealed substantial deficits of information about habitat requirements for more than 30% of Italian freshwater fish species. This information is particularly scarce for the most threatened endemic species, especially for their most critical bioperiod (i.e., spawning). With the aim of preserving freshwater fish biodiversity as required in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (European Commission, 2020), accurate information on physical habitat requirements for spawning is crucial. As an example application of MesoHABSIM, the collected habitat preference information was used to define and apply mesohabitat suitability criteria for one fish species (Telestes muticellus) in a regulated river reach of Argentina Creek (Province of Imperia, Italy). This analysis demonstrates the potential for applying information from the current review to other fish species.

AB  - Background: Heatwaves have received major attention globally due to their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. The frequency, duration, and severity of heatwaves have increased recently due to changes in climatic conditions, anthropogenic forcing, and rapid urbanization. Australia is highly vulnerable to this hazard. Although there have been an increasing number of studies conducted in Australia related to the heatwave phenomena, a systematic review of heatwave vulnerability has rarely been reported in the literature.
   Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic and overarching review of the different components of heatwave vulnerability (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) in Australia.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol. Peer-reviewed English language articles published between January 2000 and December 2021 were selected using a combination of search keywords in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Articles were critically analyzed based on three specific heatwave vulnerability components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
   Results and discussion: A total of 107 articles meeting all search criteria were chosen. Although there has been an increasing trend of heat-related studies in Australia, most of these studies have concentrated on exposure and adaptive capacity components. Evidence suggests that the frequency, severity, and duration of heatwaves in Australian cities has been increasing, and that this is likely to continue under current climate change scenarios. This study noted that heatwave vulnerability is associated with geographical and climatic factors, space, time, socioeconomic and demographic factors, as well as the physiological condition of people. Various heat mitigation and adaptation measures implemented around the globe have proven to be efficient in reducing the impacts of heatwaves.
   Conclusion: This study provides increased clarity regarding the various drivers of heatwave vulnerability in Australia. Such knowledge is crucial in informing extreme heat adaptation and mitigation planning.

AB  - Constantly changing and evolving social, economic, political, and environmental landscapes create new uncertainties in urban water supplies. These uncertainties surrounding urban water management have been captured using various scenario analysis techniques, which have been developed to envision plausible futures. Although past review papers have conducted broad reviews on water-related issues and water management generally, there has been a lack of attention to urban water management specifically. The growing uncertainty surrounding urban water management systems necessitates a focused review specifically aimed at the use of scenarios in urban water management. Using a comprehensive typology, a systematic review is presented to empirically investigate the necessary dimensions of urban water management scenario assessment. Urban water management scenario studies that exclusively employ qualitative methods, as well as urban water management studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques, are reviewed against the comprehensive typology. By aligning the reviewed scenarios with the dimensions in the typology, some important gaps in the current literature were identified. The need for: (i) transparency in scenario development and analysis processes, (ii) inclusion of surprises and extreme events, (iii) validation efforts and (iv) considering the impact phase of a scenario process. Recommendations are proposed to address the above gaps in current urban water scenarios literature, providing a path for future scenario analysis in urban water management.

AB  - Background: Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India.
   Result: There are six major forest types found in India consisting of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates are based on nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small-and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and Agrosilviculture also play an important role in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem.
   Conclusion: The systematic literature review was carried out to gather and summarize information from different studies conducted on forest ecosystems and quantification methods used for biomass estimation and carbon stock in different forests types and states of India. In general, great variability occurs in aboveground biomass and carbon stock on account of climatic and geographic differences. To obtain good and accurate estimations, following nondestructive approach, species-specific density-based equations are required from different habitats and also in relation to degradation status of forests. As such regional volume equations would increase error of estimations. The comprehensive account of data would be helpful to formulate strategies based on carbon sequestration in Indian forests for CO2 mitigation.

AB  - Riverine macrophytes play diverse and foundational ecological roles, directly influencing ecosystem properties from local biodiversity to flows of water, energy, nutrients, and sediment, many of which in turn are central to river management. Numerical modeling is thus a crucial tool for understanding macrophyte and ecosystem responses to environmental, ecological, or management changes. However, riverine macrophytes have received relatively limited modeling attention compared to plants in many other aquatic or terrestrial systems. We conducted a systematic review of riverine macrophyte growth models, focusing on mechanisms of macrophyte growth, biomass loss, and feedback effects on river ecosystems. Processes such as light availability, thermal tolerance, nutrient limitation, and mortality were widely included in almost all models meeting the review criteria. However, models varied widely in their inclusion of processes such as shading, scour, and the roles of macrophytes in stream nutrient cycles. There has been relatively little consideration of factors such as dispersal, carbon sources, herbivory, burial, desiccation, and competition for space or nutrients, indicating directions for future modeling work. In light of this, we present a conceptual framework to help guide future macrophyte growth modelers through a thorough consideration of macrophytes' myriad interactions with their ecosystems. We also emphasize the importance of modularity and accessibility toward improving efforts to model, and in turn manage, riverine ecosystems.

AB  - Background: To develop the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (AT9), the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) assembled a panel of clinical experts, information scientists, decision scientists, and systematic review and guideline methodologists.
   Methods: Clinical areas were designated as articles, and a methodologist without important intellectual or financial conflicts of interest led a panel for each article. Only panel members without significant conflicts of interest participated in making recommendations. Panelists specified the population, intervention and alternative, and outcomes for each clinical question and defined criteria for eligible studies. Panelists and an independent evidence-based practice center executed systematic searches for relevant studies and evaluated the evidence, and where resources and evidence permitted, they created standardized tables that present the quality, of the evidence and key results in a transparent fashion.
   Results: One or more recommendations relate to each specific clinical question, and each recommendation is clearly linked to the underlying body of evidence. judgments regarding the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were based on approaches developed by the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group. Panel members constructed scenarios describing relevant health states and rated the disutility associated with these states based on an additional systematic review of evidence regarding patient values and preferences for antithrombotic therapy,. These ratings guided value and preference decisions underlying the recommendations. Each topic panel identified questions in which resource allocation issues were particularly important and, for these issues, experts in economic analysis provided additional searches and guidance.
   Conclusions: AT9 methodology reflects the current science of evidence-based clinical practice guideline development, with reliance on high-quality, systematic reviews, a standardized process for quality assessment of individual studies and the body of evidence, an explicit process for translating the evidence into recommendations, disclosure of financial as well as intellectual conflicts of interest followed by management of disclosed conflicts, and extensive peer review.

AB  - Material recycling and thermal treatment are the two most common recycling methods employed for plastic waste management. Thermal treatment for energy recovery is more widely applied compared with material recycling because the latter requires a high efficiency of separation and a high purity of products. Unfortunately, certain plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are unsuitable for thermal treatment because they contain additives like chloride (Cl-) that have adverse effects on refractory materials used in boilers. As a result of this, mixed plastic wastes containing PVC generally end up in landfills. PVC-bearing mixed plastics, however, remain valuable resources as championed by the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs): Goal 12 "Responsible production and consumption", and their recycling after the removal of PVC is important. In this paper, recent studies (2012-2021) related to the separation of PVC from other types of plastics were systematically reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 66 articles were selected, reviewed, and summarized. The results showed that various separation technologies conventionally applied to mineral processing-selective comminution, gravity separation, magnetic separation, electrical separation, and flotation-have been studied for PVC separation, and the majority of these works (>60%) focused on flotation. In addition, more advanced technologies including sorting and density-surface-based separation were introduced between 2019 and 2021.

AB  - A growing body of research has investigated the experiences of parents of children treated for cancer. Until recently, a qualitative review has not been possible because of the lack of qualitative studies in this area. However, this has changed in recent years. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the findings from qualitative studies on the experiences of mothers and fathers from different countries and cultures. Twenty-eight qualitative studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Key findings included the parents' desire to feel in control, the need to continuously adjust to the unpredictable nature of cancer treatment, the adoption of various coping styles, emotional and practical support being valued, and gender and cultural differences being reported. Clinical implications include the need for health care professionals to provide clear information and aid the sense of control, care to be individualized with gender and cultural backgrounds taken into account, and fathers' needs to be acknowledged and met. Other implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Since 2000, the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, which included a goal to improve maternal health by the end of 2015, has facilitated significant reductions in maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, despite more focused efforts made especially by low-and middle-income countries, targets were largely unmet in sub-Saharan Africa, where women are plagued by many challenges in seeking obstetric care. The aim of this review was to synthesise literature on barriers to obstetric care at health institutions in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: This review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus databases were electronically searched to identify studies on barriers to health facility-based obstetric care in sub-Saharan Africa, in English, and dated between 2000 and 2015. Combinations of search terms 'obstetric care', 'access', 'barriers', 'developing countries' and 'sub-Saharan Africa' were used to locate articles. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies were considered. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to synthesise the evidence and explore relationships between included studies.
   Results: One hundred and sixty articles met the inclusion criteria. Currently, obstetric care access is hindered by several demand-and supply-side barriers. The principal demand-side barriers identified were limited household resources/income, non-availability of means of transportation, indirect transport costs, a lack of information on health care services/providers, issues related to stigma and women's self-esteem/assertiveness, a lack of birth preparation, cultural beliefs/practices and ignorance about required obstetric health services. On the supply-side, the most significant barriers were cost of services, physical distance between health facilities and service users' residence, long waiting times at health facilities, poor staff knowledge and skills, poor referral practices and poor staff interpersonal relationships.
   Conclusion: Despite similarities in obstetric care barriers across sub-Saharan Africa, country-specific strategies are required to tackle the challenges mentioned. Governments need to develop strategies to improve healthcare systems and overall socioeconomic status of women, in order to tackle supply-and demand-side access barriers to obstetric care. It is also important that strategies adopted are supported by research evidence appropriate for local conditions. Finally, more research is needed, particularly, with regard to supply-side interventions that may improve the obstetric care experience of pregnant women.

AB  - Health and well-being outcomes in communities living in proximity to mining activity may be influenced by a broad spectrum of factors including population growth, economic instability or land degradation. This review aims to synthesise broader outcomes associated with mining activity and in doing so, further explore possible determinants in communities of low- and middle-income countries. Four databases were systematically searched and articles were included if the study targeted adults residing in proximity to mining activity, and measured individual or community-level health or well-being outcomes. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Twelve articles were included. Mining was perceived to influence health behaviours, employment conditions, livelihoods and socio-political factors, which were linked to poorer health outcomes. Family relationships, mental health and community cohesion were negatively associated with mining activity. High-risk health behaviours, population growth and changes in vector ecology from environmental modification were associated with increased infectious disease prevalence. This review presents the broader health and well-being outcomes and their determinants, and strengthens the evidence to improve measurement and management of the public health implications of mining. This will support the mining sector to make sustainable investments, and support governments to maximise community development and minimise negative impacts.

AB  - Background: Adaptations of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) often occur. However, little is known about the reasons for adaptation, the adaptation process, and outcomes of adapted EBIs. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review to answer the following questions: (1) What are the reasons for and common types of adaptations being made to EBIs in community settings as reported in the published literature? (2) What steps are described in making adaptations to EBIs? and (3) What outcomes are assessed in evaluations of adapted EBIs?
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English language publications that described adaptations of public health EBIs. We searched Ovid PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycNET, and CINAHL and citations of included studies for adapted public health EBIs. We abstracted characteristics of the original and adapted populations and settings, reasons for adaptation, types of modifications, use of an adaptation framework, adaptation steps, and evaluation outcomes.
   Results: Forty-two distinct EBIs were found focusing on HIV/AIDS, mental health, substance abuse, and chronic illnesses. More than half (62%) reported on adaptations in the USA. Frequent reasons for adaptation included the need for cultural appropriateness (64.3%), focusing on a new target population (59.5%), and implementing in a new setting (57.1%). Common adaptations were content (100%), context (95.2%), cultural modifications (73.8%), and delivery (61.9%). Most study authors conducted a community assessment, prepared new materials, implemented the adapted intervention, evaluated or planned to evaluate the intervention, determined needed changes, trained staff members, and consulted experts/stakeholders. Most studies that reported an evaluation (k = 36) included behavioral outcomes (71.4%), acceptability (66.7%), fidelity (52.4%), and feasibility (52.4%). Fewer measured adoption (47.6%) and changes in practice (21.4%).
   Conclusions: These findings advance our understanding of the patterns and effects of modifications of EBIs that are reported in published studies and suggest areas of further research to understand and guide the adaptation process. Furthermore, findings can inform better reporting of adapted EBIs and inform capacity building efforts to assist health professionals in adapting EBIs.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to review the eco-innovation literature involving manufacturing firms and to offer a comprehensive insight on strategic considerations from a manufacturing context. Applying the systematic review methodology, this review involves 134 journal articles published from 2006 to 2020. Using a thematic analysis, this review finds five main topics for manufacturing research: (i) eco-design and engineering, (ii) firm characteristics and performance, (iii) decision-making behaviour and options, (iv) industrial trends and indicators, and (v) energy intensity and efficiency. Eight main targets also serve as eco-innovation strategies for manufacturing practice: (i) industrial clusters and collaborations strategy, (ii) eco-engineering standards and skills strategy, (iii) green knowledge sharing and sourcing strategy, (iv) energy pricing and costing strategy, (v) innovation incentives and investments strategy, (vi) environmental regulations and protection strategy, (vii) energy structures and systems strategy, (viii) competitive and creative design strategy. Guided by these findings and an awareness of internal, external, and bilateral factors, this review proposes a multi-level strategic framework identifying design, organisational, and regional networks as central to the management of manufacturing eco-innovation. Additionally, premised on network and symbiotic framings for manufacturing eco-innovation, this article sets an agenda for future eco-innovation research involving manufacturing firms.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is a multifaceted and constantly evolving process that is often marked by various challenges, such as environmental uncertainty, resource constraints, intense competition, and ambiguous roles. These complexities can give rise to ethical dilemmas, including conflicts of interest and unethical behavior, which can further be compounded by the incorporation of digital technology in entrepreneurship. Despite the growing recognition of the significance of entrepreneurial ethics, research in this area remains limited and fragmented. Therefore, this study aims to navigate the complexity of entrepreneurial ethics and address knowledge gaps by conducting a systematic review of the extant literature in the field of entrepreneurship, ethics, and management between 2003 and 2023 using the PRISMA protocol. The review focuses on three key aspects: (1) factors that shape entrepreneurial ethical perception and climate, (2) factors that influence entrepreneurial ethical decision making and behavior, and (3) the consequences of entrepreneurial ethical decisions and behavior. This study proposes future research avenues that can deepen our understanding of the interplay between digital technology and entrepreneurial ethics, stakeholder influence on ethical decision making, and the relationship between ethical leadership and entrepreneurial performance. Ultimately, the findings from this study provide a comprehensive framework for examining and comprehending the critical domain of entrepreneurial ethics, which can effectively address ethical dilemmas and establish socially conscious ventures that positively impact both the economy and society.

AB  - Bioeconomy is an emerging concept and no commonly accepted definition has been given so far. Bioeconomy strategies attempt to cover every aspect of this emerging concept from a different perspective, depending on the country, region, or organisation issuing them. For these reasons, each strategy has its own priority fields depending on the economic, geomorphological, social, ecological, and technological conditions of each country. In this review, an attempt is made to study the priority fields of bioeconomy strategies through a systematic review of the literature. PRISMA analysis was used to review the literature on the priority fields of bioeconomy strategies. The review examined the issue in the rich academic literature of two databases, Scopus and AgEcon. Using a repeatable search process to identify relevant studies in the literature, only 68 publications met the eligibility criteria that were included in the review. The results show that there are trends in the priority fields of bioeconomy strategies in the years 2013-2022. Moreover, the economic and technological development of the respective countries foreshadows their priorities. A successful transition to a bioeconomic model requires the participation of society as a whole, because a sustainable society as a whole requires sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. The study concludes that governance with global coordination and stakeholder training is needed for successful implementation of bioeconomy strategies.

AB  - The psychology of sustainability and sustainable development emphasizes the value to ensure health and well-being in different environments, including workplaces. Chronic exposure to noise can cause several extraordinary effects and involve all the systems of the human organism. In addition to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune effects, the data in the literature show alterations in behavioral disturbances, memory capacity, and cognitive performance. Through this systematic review, the authors try to find out the main neurobehavioral alterations in the case of occupational exposure to noise. The literature review included articles published in the major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase), using a combination of some relevant keywords. This online search yielded 4434 references; after selection, the authors analyzed 41 articles (4 narrative reviews and 37 original articles). From this analysis, it appears that the main symptoms are related to psychological distress, annoyance, sleep disturbances, and cognitive performance. Regarding tasks, the most frequent employments concern school staff, followed by employees from various industrial sectors and office workers. Although the causes are still widely debated, it is essential to protect these workers against chronic exposure to noise. In fact, in addition to a hearing loss, they can manifest many other related discomforts over time and compromise their full working capacity, as well as expose them to a greater risk of accidents or absences from work.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to clarify the relationship between sustainability-oriented innovations (SOI) and smart city development based on the systematic review of existing literature in the field. As an outcome of the review process, 159 articles were carefully selected for the in-depth analysis of the inter-linked concepts of smart city and sustainability-oriented innovations. The results show a growing trend of research papers in this field, especially in the last five years. The findings show the significance of a systemic multi-dimensional view of innovations for the smart sustainable development of cities. We have identified four main perspectives through which the scholars discourse the SOI dimensions in the smart city context: technology perspective, organizational perspective, social innovation perspective with citizen engagement, as well as system-level changes with innovation ecosystems. Second, we have recognized various focused themes under each main perspective. The various types of innovations also have impacts on different components of smart cities. Although the technological innovation perspectives dominate, and governance aspects are also paid attention to in recent studies, the increasing amount of research outputs also report on the developments of other components and perspectives, such as new human-centric approaches like citizen engagement.

AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a rapid review of the literature on gender and coastal climate adaptation. The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) highlighted some of the major ways in which gender inequality interacts with coastal climate change. However, the report does not consider how gender interacts with adaptation interventions. This review was driven the need to understand these dynamics in more detail as well as deepen the understanding of how coastal climate adaptation affects the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Our analysis is based on a screening of over 1,000 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2020. The results were strongly populated by natural science publications leading to very low coverage of gender as a social dimension of adaptation. Of the papers reviewed, a mere 2.6% discussed gender and often only in a cursory manner. While the literature surveyed does not allow us to close the gap present in the SROCC in any meaningful way, the results do provide important new insights from the literature that does exist. Of particular note is the fact that adaptation measures may have positive and negative gender outcomes currently invisible under the SDG5 framework. We conclude that there is a need to collect gender-disaggregated data on coastal adaptation efforts and to review SDG5 targets and indicators to ensure that the gender dimensions of climate adaptation are fully captured and accounted for.

AB  - Background Ankle fractures are painful and debilitating injuries that pose a significant burden to society and healthcare systems. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are commonly used outcome measures in clinical trials of interventions for ankle fracture but there is little evidence on their validity and reliability. This systematic review aims to identify and appraise evidence for the measurement properties of ankle specific PROMs used in adults with an ankle fracture using Consensus Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) methodology. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL online databases for evidence of measurement properties of ankle specific PROMs. Articles were included if they assessed or described the development of the PROM in adults with ankle fracture. Articles were ineligible if they used the PROM to assess the measurement properties of another instrument. Abstracts without full articles and conference proceedings were ineligible, as were articles that adapted the PROM under evaluation without any formal justification of the changes as part of a cross-cultural validation or translation process. Two reviewers completed the screening. To assess methodological quality we used COSMIN risk of bias checklist and summarised evidence using COSMIN quality criteria and a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data for a sample of articles. Results The searches returned a total of 377 articles. From these, six articles were included after application of eligibility criteria. These articles evaluated three PROMs: A-FORM, OMAS and AAOS. The A-FORM had evidence of a robust development process within the patient population, however lacks post-formulation testing. The OMAS showed sufficient levels of reliability, internal consistency and construct validity. The AAOS showed low quality evidence of sufficient construct validity. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of a particular PROM for use in adult ankle fracture research based on COSMIN methodology. Further validation of these outcome measures is required in order to ensure PROMs used in this area are sufficiently valid and reliable to assess treatment effects. This would enable high quality, evidenced-based management of adults with ankle fracture.

AB  - Background: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder diagnosed from the laboratory blood test results of otherwise asymptomatic patients. It has been associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes, mortality and progression to overt thyroid hormone deficiency. Current guidelines on the management of subclinical hypothyroidism differ because of conflicting evidence on long-term treatment benefits. Even though there are several existing systematic reviews on its clinical outcomes, no definitive conclusion has been reached yet. As such, a new synthesis could help provide more insight and consensus on this topic. To this purpose, this umbrella review will evaluate and synthesise current evidence on the long-term clinical outcomes of the different management strategies for subclinical hypothyroidism.
   Methods: This is a protocol for an umbrella review on the management strategies for subclinical hypothyroidism. We will conduct literature searches in multiple electronic databases (from inception onwards), namely MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, Epistemonikos database, PDQ Evidence and the PROSPERO register. There will be no restriction on the date or language of publication. Additional material will be identified through grey literature searches and citation chaining. Review inclusion criteria will be patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, receiving treatment or monitoring, no restrictions on the comparators used and with cardiovascular events, frailty fractures, quality of life and all-cause mortality as primary outcomes of interest. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data on a pre-piloted form in duplicate. Methodological quality (or bias) of included studies will be appraised using AMSTAR-2. Any conflicts that arise will be resolved through discussion or involving a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis will be provided with information presented in the main text and tables to summarise and explain the characteristics and findings of the included reviews. Even so, it is not expected that a meta-analysis will be performed due to review variability. Study limitations and methodological quality assessments will also be reported to provide context for the overall summary of evidence.
   Discussion: This review will provide a comprehensive summary of the effects of the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of subclinical hypothyroidism on specific long-term clinical outcomes. It is anticipated that the findings of this umbrella review will aid in the development of consensus-based clinical recommendations for subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as highlight areas for future research. Review findings will be disseminated primarily through peer-reviewed publications.

AB  - Alternative medicine preparations represent a significant industry worldwide. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), a buttercup plant grown in North America, is one such popular preparation for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Because the proportion of women experiencing climacteric symptoms is high, black cohosh merits further study as to its efficacy and safety. Convincing evidence for its efficacy in this setting remains to be demonstrated. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the current literature on the benefits of black cohosh for women experiencing climacteric symptoms. To this end, a PubMed search was conducted on I November 2007 using the search terms 'black cohosh' AND 'menopause'. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials in the English language involving adults. Several additional reviews dealing with alternative therapies for menopause were included to capture additional older and non-English language literature. Ultimately, 16 studies eligible for review were identified. Many of the studies had conflicting results. Methodological flaws included lack of uniformity of the drug preparation used, variable outcome measures and lack of a placebo group. The benefits of black cohosh in the management of climacteric symptoms remain to be proven. Case studies suggest an additional unexplored area of adverse events that also needs to be addressed.

AB  - Purpose - This paper examines the status and evolution of green innovation research from 1948 to 2018.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a systematic review of 293 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, the authors classify journal outlets, publication trends, research methods (research type, approach, design), themes/topics focus, country and regional distribution and theoretical perspectives, identifying main trends. They apply mixed methodologies, integrating both content and descriptive analyses.
   Findings - Results reveal the following critical conclusions: (1) publication trends disclose a steady growth of interest in green innovation research in the last decade (2011-2018), with most of the articles appearing in top-ranked journal outlets; (2) empirical studies involving quantitative surveys dominate the field over other methods like experiments, case studies (qualitative) and conceptual models; (3) research themes/topics are multi-perspectives, covering management and strategic dimension of green innovation (e.g. green innovation integration and adoption strategy; collaboration and networking in green innovation; green innovation management systems, green supply chain management, etc.), performance (financial, non-financial and both), drivers/antecedents and consumer green behavior; however, the "management and strategy" papers are by far higher; (4) studies are preponderately multi-country focused, concentrated in Europe and Australasia, with a low concentration in emerging markets like Africa and South America; And (5) the field lacks the adoption and development of novel theories. So far, the research fields principally focus on the "Porter hypothesis" and resource-based view in terms of the theory-driven studies. Based on these findings, knowledge gaps are identified, as are limitations and actionable agenda for future research.
   Originality/value - As the first systematic review to adopt a comprehensive, holistic approach in synthesizing and summarizing research vis-a-vis the phenomenon of green innovation, the study offers practitioners and researchers an insightful understanding of the relevant issues that have been investigated on green innovation, thereby anchoring the evolutions for further sustainable-oriented research and improvement in management practices.

AB  - This systematic review assembles evidence for rights-based approaches-the right to food and food sovereignty-for achieving food security and adequate nutrition (FSN). We evaluated peer-reviewed and gray literature produced between 1992 and 2018 that documents empirical relationships between the right to food or food sovereignty and FSN. We classified studies by literature type, study region, policy approach (food sovereignty or right to food) and impact (positive, negative, neutral, and reverse-positive) on FSN. To operationalize the concepts of food sovereignty and the right to food and connect them to the tangible interventions and practices observed in each reviewed study, we also classified studies according to 11 action types theorized to have an impact on FSN; these included "Addressing inequities in land access and confronting the process of land concentration" and "Promoting gender equity," among others. We found strong evidence from across the globe indicating that food sovereignty and the right to food positively influence FSN outcomes. A small number of documented cases suggest that narrow rights-based policies or interventions are insufficient to overcome larger structural barriers to realizing FSN, such as inequitable land policy or discrimination based on race, gender or class.</p>

AB  - Experimentation has been proposed as a key way in which governance drives sustainability transitions, notably by creating space for innovative solutions to emerge. In seeking to bring greater coherence to the literatures on climate and sustainability governance experiments, this article reports on a systematic review of articles published between 2009 and 2015. Based on these results a new definition and typology of climate governance experiments is suggested. The typology distinguishes between the various purposes experiments can have, including niche creation, market creation, spatial development, and societal problem solving. It deepens the understanding of the diversity in experimenting by highlighting the salient features of different types of governance experiments. It can therefore guide future research to generate more cumulative research findings contributing to a better understanding of the role and outcomes of experiments in societal transitions. The findings also suggest that real transitions towards low-carbon and climate-resilient societies will require a systematic deliberate combination of different types of experiments.

AB  - Trees contribute greatly to urban environments and human well-being, yet relatively little is known about the extent to which a rising incidence of tree insect pests and pathogens may be affecting these contributions. To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of the diverse global empirical evidence on the impacts of urban tree insect pests and pathogens, using bibliographic databases. Following screening and appraisal of over 3000 articles from a wide range of fields, 100 studies from 28 countries, spanning 1979-2021, were conceptually sorted into a three-part framework: (1) environmental impacts, representing 95 of the studies, including those reporting on tree damage, mortality, reduced growth, and changes in tree function; (2) social impacts were reported by 35 of studies, including on aesthetics, human health, and safety hazards; and (3) economic impacts, reported in 24 of studies, including on costs of pest management, and economic losses. There has been a considerable increase in urban impact studies since 2011. Evidence gaps exist on impacts on climate-regulating capacity, including temperature regulation, water retention, soil erosion, and wind protection, but also on specific hazards, nuisances, human well-being, property damages, and hazard liabilities. As a knowledge synthesis, this article presents the best available evidence of urban tree insect / pathogen impacts to guide policy, management and further research. It will enable us to better forecast how growing threats will affect the urban forest and plan for these eventualities.

AB  - The aim of this review was to update the recommendations for optimal pain management after open and laparoscopic or robotic prostatectomy. Optimal pain management is known to influence postoperative recovery, but patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy typically experience moderate dynamic pain in the immediate postoperative day. Robot-assisted and laparoscopic surgery may be associated with decreased pain levels as opposed to open surgery.
   We performed a systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) with PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English language, from January 2015 until March 2020, assessing postoperative pain, using analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions, were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases. Of the 1797 studies identified, 35 RCTs and 3 meta-analyses met our inclusion criteria. NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors proved to lower postoperative pain scores. Continuous intravenous lidocaine reduced postoperative pain scores during open surgery. Local wound infiltration showed positive results in open surgery. Bilateral transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block was performed at the end of surgery and lowered pain scores in robot-assisted procedures, but results were conflicting for open procedures. Basic analgesia for prostatic surgery should include paracetamol and NSAIDs or COX-2 selective inhibitors. TAP block should be recommended as the first-choice regional analgesic technique for laparoscopic/robotic radical prostatectomy. Intravenous lidocaine should be considered for open surgeries.

AB  - The increasing awareness about sustainable development has led to growing literature in this research area. Since the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), companies have started to focus on the environment, people, and planet with the belief that it will lead to better financial performance. Thus, the relationship between sustainability practices and financial performance of companies has attracted much attention among researchers. This study identified the trends and issues highlighted in previous studies concerning the relationship between these two variables. Content analysis was adopted in this study to examine the literature comprising a total of 56 articles indexed in Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. About 96% of the publications reported a positive relationship between sustainability practices and the financial performance of companies. This research area should be explored in all countries, especially developing countries, to facilitate the understanding of sustainability practices and their impact on financial performance.

AB  - Introduction: Community Resource Referral Systems delivered electronically through healthcare information technology systems (e.g., electronic medical records) have become more common in efforts to address patients' unmet health-related social needs. Community Resource Referral System connects patients with social supports such as food assistance, utility support, transportation, and housing. This systematic review identifies barriers and facilitators that influence the Community Resource Referral System's implementation in the U.S. by identifying and synthesizing peer -reviewed literature over a 15-year period.Methods: This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A search was con-ducted on five scientific databases to capture the literature published between January 2005 and December 2020. Data analysis was conducted from August 2021 to July 2022.Results: This review includes 41 articles of the 2,473 initial search results. Included literature revealed that Community Resource Referral Systems functioned to address a variety of health -related social needs and were delivered in different ways. Integrating the Community Resource Referral Systems into clinic workflows, maintenance of community-based organization inventories, and strong partnerships between clinics and community-based organizations facilitated implementation. The sensitivity of health-related social needs, technical challenges, and associated costs presented as barriers. Overall, electronic medical records-integration and automation of the referral process was reported as advantageous for the stakeholders.Discussion: This review provides information and guidance for healthcare administrators, clini-cians, and researchers designing or implementing electronic Community Resource Referral Systems in the U.S. Future studies would benefit from stronger implementation science methodological approaches. Sustainable funding mechanisms for community-based organizations, clear stipula-tions regarding how healthcare funds can be spent on health-related social needs, and innovative governance structures that facilitate collaboration between clinics and community-based organiza-tions are needed to promote the growth and sustainability of Community Resource Referral Systems in the U.S.Am J Prev Med 2023;65(6):1142-1152.

AB  - The digital transformation of engineering assets has been receiving increased attention from the scientific community in the last few years. In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) have been widely applied in the industry and are now reaching the civil infrastructures domain. At the same time, infrastructure managers face an increasing need to improve the sustainability and resilience of their assets. This paper aims firstly to map and present the current extent of DT application in rail and road networks, and secondly to perceive how these applications can contribute to increase their sustainability and resilience. To achieve this, the authors propose a systematic review on the DT literature related to rail and road infrastructure networks. The results show that the DT research in this domain is still scarce and that only a few use cases have attracted the attention of the scientific community. The results also indicate that most applications in rail and road networks focus on their operation and maintenance, and that there is a considerable unexplored potential for DT applications in this sector. More DT-related studies within this scope are expected to emerge in the coming years, and further research regarding its contribution to sustainability and resilience is needed.

AB  - Ecotourism is growing rapidly in biodiversity hotspots because of its promise to achieve both economic growth and environmental conservation. We reviewed the literature for empirical evidence that ecotourism protects forests. Our conclusions are at once both sobering and encouraging. Ecotourism, as it is typically practiced, leads to deforestation. However, when accompanied by conservation mechanisms (e.g. protected area, Payment for Ecosystem Services, monitoring/enforcement), ecotourism can protect forests. Ecotourism sometimes leads to forest regeneration in agrarian landscapes, but trade-offs, for example old-growth deforestation or water pollution, may occur. From a methodological perspective, we found a dearth (only 17) of articles that empirically analyzed ecotourism impacts on forests, and no studies that used counterfactual impact evaluation approaches. We conclude that there is an insufficient evidence base for inferring effects of ecotourism on forests, and we identify research priorities to build knowledge about how, when, and where to implement ecotourism.

AB  - BackgroundFunders encourage lay-volunteer inclusion in research. There are controversy and resistance, given concerns of role confusion, exploratory methods, and limited evidence about what value lay-volunteers bring to research. This overview explores these areas.
   MethodsEleven databases were searched without date or language restrictions for systematic reviews of public and patient involvement (PPI) in clinical trials design. This systematic overview of PPI included 27 reviews from which areas of good and bad practice were identified. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of PPI were explored through use of meta-narrative analysis.
   ResultsInclusion criteria were met by 27 reviews ranging in quality from high (n=7), medium (n=14) to low (n=6) reviews. Reviews were assessed using CERQUAL NICE, CASP for qualitative research and CASP for systematic reviews. Four reviews report risk of bias. Public involvement roles were primarily in agenda setting, steering committees, ethical review, protocol development, and piloting. Research summaries, follow-up, and dissemination contained PPI, with lesser involvement in data collection, analysis, or manuscript authoring. Trialists report difficulty in finding, retaining, and reimbursing volunteers. Respectful inclusion, role recognition, mutual flexibility, advance planning, and sound methods were reported as facilitating public involvement in research. Public involvement was reported to have increased the quantity and quality of patient relevant priorities and outcomes, enrollment, funding, design, implementation, and dissemination. Challenges identified include lack of clarity within common language, roles, and research boundaries, while logistical needs include extra time, training, and funding. Researchers report struggling to report involvement and avoid tokenism.
   ConclusionsInvolving patients and the public in clinical trials design can be beneficial but requires resources, preparation, training, flexibility, and time. Issues to address include reporting deficits for risk of bias, study quality, and conflicts of interests. We need to address these tensions and improve dissemination strategies to increase PPI and health literacy.

AB  - Economic Development highlights the growth and progression of every nation towards prosperity, and South Africa is not an exception to this phenomenon. Present article reviews economic progression in South Africa for last 25 years of time by applying systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis (1,241 articles) on Scopus extracted database (1994 to 2019; until 06 June). Inferences evidence significant work contributed by top universities, authors, funding sources, journals and citation statistics. Noticeably, implementation of a concept solely will not fetch real situation; however, a systematic review extends good to excellent understanding of the considered research agenda. Findings reveal the contradictory inter-connectivity of Cluster 1 Economic Inequality and Poverty, Cluster 2 Developing Country and Corruption and Cluster 6 Economic Development and Economic Policy. It is very important to understand that if a nation is facing economic inequality, corruption, and poverty; how it can achieve the status of economically developed nation. Identification of Cluster 3 Industrialization and Industry 4.0, Cluster 4 Unemployment and Entrepreneurship Education and Cluster 5 Sustainable Development and Economic Growth signifies scope of improvement. Conclusively, the researcher has proposed a conceptual model to address above stated concerns.

AB  - A growing number of soundscape studies involving audiovisual factors have been conducted; however, their bimodal and interactive effects on indoor soundscape evaluations have not yet been thoroughly reviewed. The overarching goal of this systematic review was to develop the framework for designing sustainable indoor soundscapes by focusing on audiovisual factors and relations. A search for individual studies was conducted through three databases and search engines: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. Based on the qualitative reviews of the selected thirty papers, a framework of indoor soundscape evaluation concerning visual and audiovisual indicators was proposed. Overall, the greenery factor was the most important visual variable, followed by the water features and moderating noise annoyance perceived by occupants in given indoor environments. The presence of visual information and sound-source visibility would moderate perceived noise annoyance and influence other audio-related perceptions. Furthermore, sound sources would impact multiple perceptual responses (audio, visual, cognitive, and emotional perceptions) related to the overall soundscape experiences when certain visual factors are interactively involved. The proposed framework highlights the potential use of the bimodality and interactivity of the audiovisual factors for designing indoor sound environments in more effective ways.

AB  - Context Anthropogenic changes (e.g., climate change, land-use change, species introductions, etc.) are reshaping ecosystems processes and patterns and causing an intense reorganization of the Earth's biotic systems. As a result, unprecedented combinations of species are emerging, forming "novel ecosystems". Objectives The goals of this work are: (1) to examine the history and relevance of the novel ecosystems concept in non-urban and urban contexts, and (2) to evaluate what has been the focus of the research about the novel ecosystems concept in non-urban and urban contexts. Methods Through an extensive systematic review, we collected 548 records published between 1997 and 2018. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria the final database comprised 255 relevant records that were further examined and classified according to the scope of this review. Results Our results demonstrated that research referring to the novel ecosystems concept has been mainly focused on non-urban areas. Still, there is a growing interest in exploring this concept in the urban domain. The definition and criteria used to describe novel ecosystems have been transforming over the years. Research has been mainly targeted on multiple taxonomic groups and plants, on terrestrial ecosystems, and conducted in North America. Overall, restoration ecology, conservation, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and climate change have been the most discussed topics in the novel ecosystems' literature. Conclusions Our review confirms that the application of the novel ecosystems concept to urban areas is pertinent and auspicious. Future research should seek to understand the limits and differences of novel ecosystems in non-urban and urban contexts.

AB  - This systematic review explores patterns in the peer-reviewed literature related to the integration of multiple values in coastal/marine SES in indigenous settings. We extract metadata from 109 papers across five domains: 1) general study characteristics, 2) transdisciplinarity, 3) methodology, 4) SES elements (and their relationships), and 5) values. We use latent class analysis, descriptive statistics, and different visualization tools to elicit, synthesise and highlight the identified research patterns. Our results suggest that the peer-reviewed literature can be categorised across two main research approaches, contextual research and causal research. The former mainly uses qualitative techniques to study the drivers and pressures in such coastal/marine SES, providing a rather comprehensive understanding of these issues. The latter tends to engage better relevant stakeholders as a means of explaining relationships/impacts within such SES. Furthermore, causal research studies employ a more robust methodological portfolio. We argue that cross-fertilization between these distinct research approaches can contribute towards a more effective integration of different knowledge systems and values in indigenous coastal/marine contexts. In particular, contextual research can point "where we need to go", while causal research can employ novel tools to assess in depth the multiple values related to the ecosystem services provided by indigenous coastal/marine SES.

AB  - Systematic review is usually used to reveal the change characteristics of the quantity and law of the citations focus on one research theme. The paper investigated the research status, development trend and hotspots of water ecological environment protection using bibliometric analysis. Based on bibliometric, mathematics and statistics, articles related to the water ecological environment protection in Web of Science for the period of 2008-2019 were selected. CiteSpace software was used to conduct the annual frequency analysis of papers, countries and research institutions analysis, co-occurring keywords analysis, clustering analysis and research frontier. Results show that: (1) The number of published papers and cited papers have increased for the past 12 years. Especially, the number of published papers has increased sharply since 2015, indicating that the research on water ecological environment protection has been transferred from the exploration stage to rapid development stage, which needs to be analyzed from the aspects of national policy. (2) China has more publications than other countries. The research institutions are mainly concentrated on universities, the cooperation among them is not close. It shows the characteristics of small distribution and large concentration. Keywords such as "model" and "water quality" are research hotspots. (3) The results of clustering analysis show that water ecological environment quality assessment, water and soil conservation, ecosystem services and aquatic ecosystem are four main research directions of water ecological environment protection. (4) Using method of burst detection, nine keywords are obtained, which indicate that water ecological environment protection has rich research perspectives. The burst strength of land use is high, it will become the research hotspot of water ecological environment protection in future. The results should be beneficial to systematically understand research progress and future trends of water ecologic environment under changing environment, and therefore it promotes ecological civilization construction.

AB  - Recently, the notion of a smart city, which includes smart well-being, smart transit, and smart society, has attracted much attention due to its impact on people's quality of living. Data in smart cities are characterized by variety, velocity, volume, value, and veracity that are the well-known characteristics of big data. The fast pace expanding of IoT devices and sensors in smart cities generates a huge volume of data that can help decision-makers and managers in city management. The aim of this article is to wholly and systematically review big data handling approaches in smart cities, in which we analyze research efforts published between 2013 and February 2021, where these techniques are categorized based on their algorithms and architectures. Further, the main ideas, evaluation techniques, tools, evaluation metrics, algorithm types, advantages, and disadvantages are explored. Additionally, essential evaluation factors are introduced in which scalability and availability by 16%, time by 15% and accuracy by 11% are more in focus, and finally, some of the challenges, open issues, and future trends that are valuable for further research are suggested in big data handling approaches in smart cities.

AB  - Introduction: Over the past decade, there has been mounting recognition that opioid use and related mortality and morbidity is a significant public health problem in rural, non-urban areas across the globe. Taking what has been termed the 'opioid crisis' as a starting off point, this article aims to systematically review the qualitative literature on the ways in which rurality shapes the risk for opioid-related harm.
   Methods: A systematic review was undertaken using database searches and secondary reference list searches for qualitative literature on rural and non-urban opioid-related harms. A total of 32 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed in NVivo 12 using a codebook based on the 'risk environment' framework.
   Results: The findings explore how rurality shapes the risk environment for opioid-related harms through four environment influences: (1) economic conditions, including economic transition and deindustrialisation that has occurred in many rural areas, and the high levels of economic distress experienced by rural residents; (2) physical conditions, including a lack of infrastructure and recreation opportunities, larger geographic distances, and limited transportation; (3) social conditions, where social networks could be both protective but also amplify risk through a lack of knowledge about treatment and risk behaviours, a lack of anonymity and stigmatisation of people who use opioids in rural areas; and (4) policy conditions including limited coverage and availability of harm reduction and drug treatment services, and stigmatising service provider practices.
   Conclusions: The impact of rurality on risk of opioid-related harm is multifaceted. We suggest that future research on rural opioid use would benefit from drawing on the theoretical toolkit of rural criminology to attend to the ways the 'rural crisis', and attendant insecurities, anxieties and strains, impacts upon rural communities and shapes risk, along with how socio-cultural characteristics of the rural 'organise' risks of drug use.

AB  - The innovative technologies developed in the different fields of science (nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, genetic modification, etc.) opened new and infinite possibilities for the several stakeholders that carry out their activities in the different economic sectors. For agriculture, these new approaches are particularly relevant and may bring interesting contributions, considering the specificities of the sector, often dealing with contexts of land abandonment and narrow profit margins. Nonetheless, the question in these unstopped evolutions is about the interlinkages with sustainability. In this context, the objectives of this study are to highlight the main insights from the available scientific literature about the interrelationships between the new trends in the agriculture and the sustainability. To achieve these aims, a search on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) and Scopus databases was carried out, on 15 May 2021, for the topics 'smart agriculture' and 'sustainability'. A total of 231 documents (102 from WoS and 129 from Scopus) were obtained, remaining 155 documents after removing the duplicated, which were surveyed through systematic review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. As main insights, the concerns of the researchers with the impacts on the sustainability from the transformations in the farming organization are highlighted. On the other hand, it was shown the relevance and the new opportunities, including in terms of food supply, arising from the precision agriculture, agricultural intelligence, vertical/urban farming, circular economy, internet of things, and crowdfarming. We suggest the new and wider concept of 'integrated-smart agriculture', better than 'climate-smart agriculture'.

AB  - Fire is a natural agent with a paramount role in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity maintenance. Still, it can also act as a negative force against many ecosystems. Despite some knowledge of the interactions of fire and vegetation, there is no clear understanding of how different components of fire regimes (i.e., severity, history, or frequency) influence known patterns of animal communities. Therefore, we performed a systematic review on the global responses of arthropods, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians to different fire regimes. Specifically, we focused on assessing how fire severity, history, and frequency modulate the effect of fire on the richness and abundance of faunal communities. We conducted a systematic review of 566 papers retrieved from the Scopus database. We also scrutinized all the documents included in the meta-analysis of Pastro et al. (Pastro et al. Glob Ecol Biogeogr 23:1146-1156, 2014). Our selection criteria excluded studies without data on species richness or abundance. We also excluded studies without adequate controls and those without information about the fire regime of the study zone. After careful examination, we used data from 162 studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis. From the 162 studies meeting our selection criteria, nearly 60% of the studies are from North America, 25% from Australia, 11% from Europe, and 4% from the tropics. According to the ecological role of fire, 90% of the studies were carried out in fire-dependent ecosystems (i.e., conifer forests, natural savannas, pastures). Finally, 40% of the studies analyzed birds, 22% mammals, and 20% arthropods. The meta-analysis of the available evidence indicates that fire history is an important modulator of animal richness and abundance. Whether negative or positive, animal responses depended on the time since the last fire event. Considering that short-term studies may not capture such a long-term effect on fauna, this translates to more challenges at implementing fire management strategies. Whether or not we can anticipate the impact of the fire will then depend on future efforts to implement long-term research.

AB  - Purpose Innovation in rural tourism and hospitality (RT) is a complex process that involves the exchange of knowledge and resources between many actors and the interrelationships between those actors in the business environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide structure to this "knowledge and resource ecosystem" through a thorough systematic review of the extant literature. Design/methodology/approach The current study uses a time-tested and reproducible systematic literature review process to identify and analyse 79 research papers that have discussed innovation in RT. Findings Through content analyses, this review identifies critical stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem, as well as the enabling and hindering roles these stakeholders play in innovation. The thematic analysis uncovers three key research foci: stakeholders and their roles, outcomes of innovation and business model innovation. The review also identifies types of innovation and critically analyses the bibliographical research profile. The authors summarise the findings in an RT innovation ecosystem model, which includes the various actors and their knowledge and resource sharing roles within the business environment. Originality/value This is one of the first systematic reviews to concentrate on RT innovation and, within that focus, on knowledge and resource networks in particular rather than on innovation in tourism in general, which was the focus of prior reviews. The authors encourage cross-pollination of ideas by introducing theories from the strategic management, innovation, knowledge management and business model innovation literature wherever appropriate. To consolidate and present the findings on the innovation process's antecedents and outcomes, the authors present an ecosystem of innovation within the RT framework.

AB  - The need to produce an ever-increasing quantity of material products and food resulting from the planet globalization process has contributed to the spread of modern agriculture based on a linear production resulting in the generation of tons of waste. This huge amount of waste is generally accumulated in landfills, causing different environmental problems. Hence, researchers moved on to study the processes used to recover agro-industrial by-products within a circular and sustainable bio-economy concept. A systematic quest on Scopus and PubMed databases was performed to identify the data available to date on recycling agro-industrial by-products of Olea europaea L. This systematic review summarizes the knowledge regarding the use of olive trees by-products for producing animal feed, biocomposites, bioethanol, cellulose pulp, activated carbon, and as a fuel source for energy production. Furthermore, the data regarding the potential biological activity of extracts from olive roots, wood, bark, and pruning were analyzed. Olive trees by-products are, indeed, rich in molecules with antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, and anticancer activity, representing a promising candidate for treat several human diseases.

Purpose: As enterprises are directed through corporate governance, the integration of corporate sustainability is a necessary step to secure long-term firm success and react to recent social and environmental developments. Against this background, this paper investigates the following research question: Which internal corporate governance mechanisms drive corporate sustainability? Findings: The results gained from a sample of 56 articles show findings for different internal corporate governance mechanisms such as board diversity, board independence, the board size, the board-level sustainability committee, the role of the CEO, ownership concentration, and the disclosure and transparency practice, which play a role in guiding a firm in a sustainable direction and achieving sustainability integration. The role of board diversity is discussed the most throughout the literature. Practical implications: The results suggest that boards should be designed diversely and independently while having an appropriate size to work effectively. Furthermore, the sustainability strategies of CEOs should be motivated by incentives. Nevertheless, there has to be a consideration of the interrelations of the investigated mechanisms. Social implications: The results suggest that being more transparent and showing non-financial performance at least compliant to sustainability regulations increases the orientation on stakeholder interests and long-term focus. Originality/value: The paper systemizes the research field related to internal corporate governance mechanisms and corporate sustainability to give an overview of the current research landscape and discuss the identified drivers. Overall, this research comprehensively sketches of what is known and unknown about the questions addressed in the systematic review.

AB  - From farm to fork, food and beverage consumption can have significant negative impacts on energy consumption, water consumption, climate change, and other environmental subsystems. This paper presents a comprehensive, critical and systematic review of more than 350,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 701 studies, on the topic of greenhouse gas emissions from the food and beverage industry. Utilizing a sociotechnical lens that examines food supply and agriculture, manufacturing, retail and distribution, and consumption and use, the review identifies the most carbon-intensive processes in the industry, as well as the corresponding energy and carbon ?footprints?. It discusses multiple current and emerging options and practices for decarbonization, including 78 potentially transformative technologies. It examines the benefits to sector decarbonization?including energy and carbon savings, cost savings, and other co-benefits related to sustainability or health?as well as barriers across financial and economic, institutional and managerial, and behavioral and consumer dimensions. It lastly discusses how financing, business models, and policy can be harnessed to help overcome these barriers, and identifies a set of research gaps.

AB  - The paper is devoted to building up a comprehensive model of the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability practices based on the analysis of their main predictors to ease the process of managing CSR and sustainability activities and provide practical recommendations for businesses regarding successful realization of their business, social and sustainable development goals. Currently, businesses integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability practices into their strategies to enable the fulfillment of sustainability goals and gain competitive advantages. Therefore, to achieve the aim of the study, a systematic review methodology was used in six stages: (1) defining the benchmarks; (2) extraction of papers from the two most cited databases: Web of Science and Scopus; (3) Manual content analysis of all extracted papers; (4) Identification of the dominant categories of this research topic; (5) The development of a comprehensive model of the relationship between CSR and sustainability, and(6) Discussion and control of obtained results and provision of recommendations for future studies. The model suggested is seen as a roadmap for organizations in different sectors of the economy and includes a variety of determinants that were divided into two groups depending on their relevance to an organization: the components of human and social capital, the technical characteristics of an organization and financial dimensions, and the outside business environment, which is determined by the political system and the level of corruption.

AB  - There has been rapid global dissemination of parenting interventions, yet little is known about their effectiveness when transported to countries different from where they originated, or about factors influencing success. This is the first systematic attempt to address this issue, focusing on interventions for reducing child behavior problems. Stage 1 identified evidence-based parenting interventions showing robust effects in systematic reviews; Stage 2 identified trials of these interventions in a new country. Systematic review/meta-analysis of transported programs was followed by subgroup analyses by trial-and country-level cultural, resource, and policy factors. We found 17 transported trials of 4 interventions, originating in United States or Australia, tested in 10 countries in 5 regions, (n = 1,558 children). Effects on child behavior were substantial (SMD -.71) in the (14) randomized trials, but nonsignificant in the (3) nonrandomized trials. Subgroup analyses of randomized trials found no association between effect size and participant or intervention factors (e.g., program brand, staffing). Interventions transported to "western'' countries showed comparable effects to trials in origin countries; however, effects were stronger when interventions were transported to culturally more distant regions. Effects were higher in countries with survival-focused family/childrearing values than those ranked more individualistic. There were no differences in effects by country-level policy or resource factors. Contrary to common belief, parenting interventions appear to be at least as effective when transported to countries that are more different culturally, and in service provision, than those in which they were developed. Extensive adaptation did not appear necessary for successful transportation.

AB  - Water conservation is essential to sustainable development, and among human activities, buildings are responsible for a significant portion of total water consumption. Therefore, we present a systematic review that aims to search for valuable contributions from benchmarking and their potential significance to water conservation. The relevance of performing such a review is to support the research in the field, organise information, and highlight both the lack of data and valuable results in specific building types. Benchmarking highlights best performance buildings, while it also classifies performances, which allows developing interventions for different buildings. Seventy-two documents on the environmental performance of buildings were reviewed, and a variety of methods, metering procedures, and indicators were found as valuable data for water-saving initiatives. In addition to a systematic search in SCOPUS, searches were made in Science Direct and Google Scholar databases. Although the main challenge in this matter lies in the lack of procedures standardisation, it was found that performing benchmarking is relevant for accurately developing water conservation initiatives. Gains of over five million m(3) per year in a set of buildings or above 151 thousand m(3) per year in a single factory were found, which indicate the existing potential for water conservation.

AB  - Background: The impact of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality risk reduction remains unclear due to conflicting study findings. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published between 1983 and 2022, that reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation in adults versus placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-cardiovascular mortality (non-CVM), and cardiovascular morbidities. Only studies with a follow-up period longer than one year were included. The primary outcomes were ACM and CVM. Secondary outcomes were non-CVM, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and major or extended adverse cardiovascular events. Subgroup analyses were performed according to low-, fair- and good-quality RCTs. Results: Eighty RCTs were assessed, including 82,210 participants receiving vitamin D supplementation and 80,921 receiving placebo or no treatment. The participants' mean (SD) age was 66.1 (11.2) years, and 68.6% were female. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a lower risk of ACM (OR: 0.95 [95%CI 0.91-0.99] p = 0.013), was close to statistical significance for a lower risk of non-CVM (OR: 0.94 [95%CI 0.87-1.00] p = 0.055), and was not statistically associated with a lower risk of any cardiovascular morbi-mortality outcome. Meta-analysis of low-quality RCTs showed no association with cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular morbi-mortality outcomes. Conclusions: The emerging results of our meta-analysis present evidence that vitamin D supplementation appears to decrease the risk of ACM (especially convincing in the fair- and good-quality RCTs), while not showing a decrease in the specific cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Thus, we conclude that further research is warranted in this area, with well-planned and executed studies as the basis for more robust recommendations.

AB  - Background: Human resource for health crisis has impaired global efforts against malaria in highly endemic countries. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended scaling-up of community health workers (CHWs) and related cadres owing to their documented success in malaria and other disease prevention and management. Evidence is inconsistent on the roles and challenges they encounter in malaria interventions. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on roles and challenges of CHWs and related cadres in integrated community case management for malaria (iCCM).
   Methods: This systematic review retrieved evidence from PubMed, CINAHL, ISI Web of Knowledge, and WHO regional databases. Terms extracted from the Boolean phrase used for PubMed were also used in other databases. The review included studies with Randomized Control Trial, Quasi-experimental, Pre-post interventional, Longitudinal and cohort, Cross-sectional, Case study, and Secondary data analysis. Because of heterogeneity, only narrative synthesis was conducted for this review.
   Results: A total of 66 articles were eligible for analysis out of 1380 studies retrieved. CHWs and related cadre roles in malaria interventions included: malaria case management, prevention including health surveillance and health promotion specific to malaria. Despite their documented success, CHWs and related cadres succumb to health system challenges. These are poor and unsustainable finance for iCCM, workforce related challenges, lack of and unsustainable supply of medicines and diagnostics, lack of information and research, service delivery and leadership challenges.
   Conclusions: Community health workers and related cadres had important preventive, case management and promotive roles in malaria interventions. To enable their effective integration into the health systems, the identified challenges should be addressed. They include: introducing sustainable financing on iCCM programmes, tailoring their training to address the identified gaps, improving sustainable supply chain management of malaria drugs and diagnostics, and addressing regulatory challenges in the local contexts.

AB  - Nurses are key to the delivery of global primary health care services. However, there appears to be a lack of evaluation of primary health care nursing delivery models in the published literature. This evaluation is vital to the improvement of patient experiences, national and global health outcomes, and the justification of future investment in primary health care nursing services. The purpose of this review was to explore and analyze the literature that reports on the evaluation of primary health care nursing services, to ascertain the nature and utility of these evaluation methods, and identify opportunities for future research in this area. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using the databases CINAHL, Joanna Briggs Institute, MEDLINE, and Proquest. Thirty-two articles published between 2010 and 2022 were selected. Results were organized using the Donabedian model. A paucity of research into the evaluation of nurse-led primary health care services was noted. Where evident, evaluation of primary health care nursing services tended to reflect the medical model. Medical outcomes measures dominated evaluation criteria including diagnosis rates, prescription costs, and disease outcomes. Primary health care principles such as service accessibility, cultural appropriateness, and availability were rarely used. The perspectives and experiences of nurses were not sought in service evaluation, including most of the nurse-led services. Development of an evidence-base of nursing primary health care services that are informed by the nursing experience and apply a framework of universal primary health care principles across the structure, process, and outcomes aspects of the service is recommended.

AB  - Functional diversity is an emergent approach in ecology that has been applied globally to better understand the relationships between organisms and the environment. However, assessing the functional diversity of freshwater fish is a challenge for scientists. Aiming to summarize the evolution of scientific knowledge on fish functional diversity, we performed a systematic review of the literature published from 1945 to 2021 using the Web of Science. Based on the 101 articles reviewed, we found that publications about functional diversity of fishes have increased over time, mainly in Neotropical, Indomalayan and Palearctic regions. Most studies were conducted in lotic ecosystems, especially to assess environmental impacts such as biological invasions and land use. Functional diversity has been assessed mainly by morphological traits that reflect feeding and locomotion dimensions. Functional richness was the most common index used in the studies. Our findings suggest that political neglect and lack of investments may hamper the research development in several places. The missing information about the functional traits of many species may limit the use of the functional approach. We also highlight the need for the incorporation of functional diversity in conservation programs once functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity to maintain freshwater ecosystem functioning.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to present a review of published academic work on art and tourism. A distinction between papers researching tourism and mentioning art just as one of tourism activities and papers covering "art tourism" specifically is proposed. Design/methodology/approachThe review is grounded on a content analysis of studies containing the words "art" and "tourism" published in the Scopus database. Moreover, to analyze papers specifically consisting of the term "art tourism" a theory-context-characteristics-methods structure was used - the authors call these papers art-tourism-specific papers. FindingsWhile the number of "art and tourism" papers has been increasing in the past 40 years, little is known about "art tourism" as an independent form of tourism. This study finds limited work on art tourists' characteristics, preferences and behaviors as costumers. No art-based research and little research with visual representations was found. Artists are very rarely participants of art tourism research. Research limitations/implicationsMost research is conceptual, and little applied research can be identified. Importantly, besides synthesizing and critically assessing the current corpus of knowledge on art tourism, this review presents a final roadmap with directions for future research. One of the limitations of this review is that only studies included in the Scopus database and published in English were considered. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive systematic review of published academic research on art and tourism in the past 40 years. The results of this study offer directions to future art tourism researchers.

AB  - Relevant research has investigated how predictive modeling algorithms, deep-learning-based sensing technologies, and big urban data configure immersive hyperconnected virtual spaces in digital twin cities: digital twin modeling tools, monitoring and sensing technologies, and Internet-of-Things-based decision support systems articulate big-data-driven urban geopolitics. This systematic review aims to inspect the recently published literature on digital twin simulation tools, spatial cognition algorithms, and multi-sensor fusion technology in sustainable urban governance networks. We integrate research developing on how blockchain-based digital twins, smart infrastructure sensors, and real-time Internet of Things data assist urban computing technologies. The research problems are whether: data-driven smart sustainable urbanism requires visual recognition tools, monitoring and sensing technologies, and simulation-based digital twins; deep-learning-based sensing technologies, spatial cognition algorithms, and environment perception mechanisms configure digital twin cities; and digital twin simulation modeling, deep-learning-based sensing technologies, and urban data fusion optimize Internet-of-Things-based smart city environments. Our analyses particularly prove that virtual navigation tools, geospatial mapping technologies, and Internet of Things connected sensors enable smart urban governance. Digital twin simulation, data visualization tools, and ambient sound recognition software configure sustainable urban governance networks. Virtual simulation algorithms, deep learning neural network architectures, and cyber-physical cognitive systems articulate networked smart cities. Throughout January and March 2023, a quantitative literature review was carried out across the ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, with search terms comprising "sustainable urban governance networks" + "digital twin simulation tools", "spatial cognition algorithms", and "multi-sensor fusion technology". A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow diagram was generated using a Shiny App. AXIS (Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies), Dedoose, MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool), and the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) were used to assess the quality of the identified scholarly sources. Dimensions and VOSviewer were employed for bibliometric mapping through spatial and data layout algorithms. The findings gathered from our analyses clarify that Internet-of-Things-based smart city environments integrate 3D virtual simulation technology, intelligent sensing devices, and digital twin modeling.

AB  - Background and Objectives Despite acknowledged benefits of residents in nursing homes spending time outdoors, little is known about factors related to their use of outdoor space. This systematic review summarizes reported barriers and enablers to nursing home residents' use of outdoor spaces. Research Design and Methods Multiple databases were searched to May 2018. Qualitative or mixed methods studies describing barriers/enablers to use of outdoor areas by residents of nursing homes (aged 65 years and older), as reported by residents, staff, or family members were included. Study quality rating, thematic analysis, and stratified analyses were performed and confidence in findings assessed using GRADE-CERQual. Results Twenty-four studies were included. Nineteen collected data from residents, 15 from staff/caregivers, 7 from families. Major themes and key findings concerned: design of the outdoor area (importance of garden greenery and built features), safety concerns and staffing issues, weather and seasons (appropriate shade and shelter), design of the main building (easy to open doors and nearby access points) and social activities. Conclusions and Implications Providing gardens with seasonal plants and interactive features, weather protected seating, manageable doors at accessible thresholds, planned social activities, and appropriate clothing are fundamental to facilitate nursing home residents' access to the outdoors. Cultural change at an organizational level, addressing perceptions of safety as a barrier is important. Incorporation of the recommendations in this review by architects, facility managers, and policy makers in the design and management of nursing homes, may increase use of outdoor areas and improve the quality of life of residents. Registration The protocol is registered in Prospero (CRD42018100249).

AB  - Agriculture in China is undergoing a swift transformation to modify labour relocation. This change is spearheaded by commercial farms and other Chinese government interventions thereby promoting agricultural production and rural growth. The input-dependent industrial model of agriculture is also considered in conflict with attaining a safe and healthy environment for its inhabitants. The current approaches initiated in the tea sector have witnessed several enriched sustainable agricultural technologies (SATs). The SATs seek to increase yield while ensuring agricultural sustainability via ecological strategies. However, reports have shown farmers have low desire resulting in a lower acceptance rate of SATs among Chinese farmers. We provide a systematic review with a focus on the key determinants of SATs adoption rate in tea production in China from 2000 to 2022. The results revealed the significance and suitability of different approaches in establishing farmers' adoption behaviour. The specificity of farmers' SAT adoption behaviour is essentially not compromised by any codified variables but the interrelationship among the determinants, including socio-demographic, agroecological and environmental, technological, institutional, and social networks, and informational, and farmer behavioural factors. We recommend that the government increase awareness of SATs to promote public demand for agricultural sustainability, particularly in developing countries.

AB  - Effective, accountable and transparent institutions, that engage in inclusive and participatory governance, are crucial for the sustainability of global development investments. However, there is a debate about whether effective approaches to improving governance processes operate from the bottom up (e.g. by enabling citizens to hold service providers accountable) or the top down (by enabling service providers to be held accountable by the State). This paper systematically reviews participation and accountability mechanisms in a range of sectors, drawing on principles of realist evaluation to develop and test middle-range theory using framework synthesis and statistical meta-analysis. We show that interventions promoting citizen engagement through participatory priority setting or accountability mechanisms are often effective in stimulating active citizen engagement in service delivery and realising improvements in access to services, where they facilitate direct engagement between service users and front-line service providers, such as in health care. However, citizen engagement interventions alone are not effective where services are accessed independently of service provider staff, for example road infrastructure. Interventions promoting participation by increasing citizens' pressures on politicians to hold providers to account are also not usually able to influence service delivery.

AB  - In West Africa, climate variations and droughts have always affected livelihoods but have also triggered adaptation strategies. A better understanding of the impacts of drought and the responses of West African populations is indispensable for researchers and decision makers in the current and future context of multiple socioeconomic and environmental changes, including climate change. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on drought in West Africa. In this paper, we highlight controversial issues and identify knowledge gaps. Although drought has been widely considered as a major problem in West Africa, there is a need to frame it within a set of multiple threats faced by local populations and to understand how droughts act as a trigger in economic, societal, and environmental contexts. The literature on responses to drought focuses on agricultural and individual responses, while diversification, migration, and tree-based or livestock-based responses are less frequently addressed. More research is needed on the effectiveness and on the unexpected effects of responses of populations, states, and NGOs, as well as on the interactions between different responses. To understand the complexity of impacts and responses, the context in which they occur and how individual and collective actions interact within households or communities needs to be taken into account. Ecosystems and agriculture offer many goods and services that are suitable for adaptation and the different landscape components should be analyzed together. Such historical, contextual, and integrated analyses would better inform new policies and projects for adaptation to climate change.

AB  - It is expected that by 2030, 5 billion of the earth's population will live in cities. This growth in urbanisation results in significant challenges pertaining to environmental and social sustainability. Most of the cities are located near coastal areas and thus under the threat of sea rise. This paper explores sustainable floating cities with the key sustainable factors as an alternative to meet the requirement of future urbanisation. The purpose of this paper was to find the key sustainability factors and then explore the solutions to achieve them in the sustainable floating cities. A mixed research strategy using qualitative and quantitative approaches was adopted to achieve the aims of this research. The key sustainability factors were derived from the existing literature using a systematic review approach and then ranked using a questionnaire administrated among selected respondents. The top-ranked factors that include energy, water, food, waste, mobility and habitat regeneration were considered and were further explored using a systematic review method. The review suggests that there are different arrangements and techniques available to meet the requirement of future sustainable floating cities. The discussion reveals that the concept of floating cities is at its initial stage and has the potential for multidisciplinary research.

AB  - The use of technology in the healthcare sector and its medical practices, from patient record maintenance to diagnostics, has significantly improved the health care emergency management system. At that backdrop, it is crucial to explore the role and challenges of these technologies in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this study provides a systematic review of the literature on technological developments in the healthcare sector and deduces its pros and cons. We curate the published studies from the Web of Science and Scopus databases by using PRISMA 2015 guidelines. After mining the data, we selected only 55 studies for the systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. The study explores four significant classifications of technological development in healthcare: (a) digital technologies, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) blockchain, and (d) the Internet of Things. The novel contribution of current study indicate that digital technologies have significantly influenced the healthcare services such as the beginning of electronic health record, a new era of digital healthcare, while robotic surgeries and machine learning algorithms may replace practitioners as future technologies. However, a considerable number of studies have criticized these technologies in the health sector based on trust, security, privacy, and accuracy. The study suggests that future studies, on technological development in healthcare services, may take into account these issues for sustainable development of the healthcare sector.

AB  - This paper reviews literature relating to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and human well-being. It finds that explicit studies on human well-being from MPAs are limited and empirical studies quantifying these relationships are rare. Most MPA papers, including those examining MPA effectiveness, focus on just a few aspects of well-being in the context of a sub-set of stakeholders, and consider only a single type of MPA. They mostly focus on conventional objective measures that are not comprehensive or systematically selected. This review argues for a systematic and integrative framework to ensure future MPA assessments are equipped to capture MPAs' contributions to human well-being more adequately and comprehensively. Such a framework can also allow for cross-MPA comparisons that can capture differences in well-being across different types of MPAs, and information gained can be useful for MPA practitioners and policy makers, particularly in reaching current global targets, such as the CBD, Aichi Target 11.

AB  - Background The Syrian Civil War has caused over 400 000 traumatic deaths. Understanding the nature of war casualties is crucial to deliver healthcare improvement. Historic regional conflicts and Syrian mortality data have been characterised by blast injuries. The aim of this novel review is to assess the trauma epidemiology of Syrian Civil War casualties from the perspective of healthcare facilities. Methods This review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method. Studies addressing Syria, trauma and war were investigated. Eligibility criteria included being conducted from a healthcare facility, published in English and peer reviewed. The outcomes were demography, mechanism of injury and anatomical injury site. Results 38 papers satisfied the eligibility criteria. 13 842 casualties were reported across the entire data set. Casualties were 88.8% male (n=4035 of 4544). Children contributed to 16.1% of cases (n=398 of 2469). Mortality rate was 8.6% (n=412 of 4774). Gunshot wound was the most common mechanism of injury representing 66.3% (n=7825 of 11799). Head injury was the most common injured site at 26.6% (n=719 of 2701). Conclusions This conflict has a distinct trauma profile compared with regional modern wars. The prevalence of gunshot wounds represents a marked change in mechanism of injury. This may be related to higher mortality rate and proportion of head injuries identified. This review cannot correlate mechanism of injury, demographics or injuries sustained to outcomes. The quality of data from the included studies lacked standardisation; future research and consistent reporting tools are required to enable further analysis.

AB  - Purpose - Digital twin (DT) and building information modeling (BIM) are interconnected in some ways. However, there has been some misconception about how DT differs from BIM. As a result, industry professionals reject DT even in BIM-based construction projects due to reluctance to innovate. Furthermore, researchers have repeatedly developed tools and techniques with the same goals using DT and BIM to assist practitioners in construction projects. Therefore, this study aims to assist industry professionals and researchers in understanding the relationship between DT and BIM and synthesize existing works on DT and BIM.Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review was conducted on published articles related to DT and BIM. A total record of 54 journal articles were identified and analyzed.Findings - The analysis of the selected journal articles revealed four types of relationships between DT and BIM: BIM is a subset of DT, DT is a subset of BIM, BIM is DT, and no relationship between BIM and DT. The existing research on DT and BIM in construction projects targets improvements in five areas: planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning. In addition, several areas have emerged, such as developing geo-referencing approaches for infrastructure projects, applying the proposed methodology to other construction geometries and creating 3D visualization using color schemes.Originality/value - This study contributed to the existing body of knowledge by overviewing existing research related to DT and BIM in construction projects. Also, it reveals research gaps in the body of knowledge to point out directions for future research.

AB  - Forest ecosystems provide various services that are crucial to human beings, in which carbon sequestration and storage is one of them with the most market potential and is usually governed by market-based instruments (MBIs). MBIs do not operate alone but in the hybrid governance arrangements. While the importance of public institutions has been identified, there is still a need to examine the specific role of public institutions in the market-oriented mechanism. Our work seeks answers to this question. This meta-study presents an up-to-date picture of MBIs targeted at forest carbon, in which 88 mechanisms are synthesized in a quantitative database. We analyze and discuss policy design features of these mechanisms and group them into nine types of MBIs. We find that many instruments coexist and/or interact with other instruments. In light of these results, we introduce the concept of policy mix and argue that the interplay among policy instruments can be complementary or interdependent. Using cluster analysis to identify underlying patterns, we reconfirm previous findings that there are distinct differences between public and private PES schemes, but also recognize a new cluster and label it as a 'legally binding mechanism'. We discover that the role of public institutions is pronounced in the forest carbon mechanisms, and they can be the buyer, seller, regulator, coordinator, intermediary, and facilitator. Besides, public institutions tend to play an increasing role in the future climate policy arena. We believe that public institutions should stand out and create enabling conditions for private governance and finance.

AB  - This paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature to understand current trends in the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus for development-oriented policy support. The paper follows three steps: (a) a bibliometric analysis of FEW nexus research, (b) a content analysis of FEW nexus research, and (c) development of a framework that fills existing gaps in FEW nexus research. The review found that FEW nexus approaches have gained ground in academia as a resource management tool and policy guide; however, the process does not have a robust conceptualization. The current FEW nexus approaches focus on national, regional, and international scales of analysis to understand the three sectors' interactions. Further, these approaches underline the nexus processes, which have been researched in detail, including synergies and tradeoffs. However, research on the FEW nexus has not adequately explored the social factors that form part of the nexus, especially at the local household scale. Factors such as the gender dynamics of resource ownership, work roles at different scales, household incomes, and culture are essential components that are yet to be explored in FEW nexus research. Most of the existing frameworks on the FEW nexus overemphasize models and the quantitative measurement of processes while paying limited attention to social aspects. Still, these social aspects are crucial, especially on the household scale; therefore, to overcome these gaps, this paper proposes a FEW nexus framework at the local household scale that includes socio-economic determinants.

AB  - South America sustains an important part of the world's terrestrial biodiversity and its population is highly urbanized. Global syntheses have revealed a paucity of urban ecological research in the region; however, local research might be overlooked due to language barriers. As a contribution to disseminating local knowledge, we conducted a synthesis of Spanish-language literature on bird species richness in the Southern Cone of South America - an area of high diversity, endemism, and more than half of the world's terrestrial biome types. In this systematic review, we identified patterns and trends in the literature, and the variables that influence bird species richness. Research has focused on national capital cities and green areas (large urban parks). Most studies covered short periods of time (1 year or less) and involved one season only (reproductive). The most studied biomes were temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands, and Mediterranean and temperate forests, and no studies were found in mountains or deserts. Bird species richness in cities from the Southern Cone was positively influenced by vegetation cover and plant and habitat diversity; whereas variables associated with urban cover and disturbance exhibited negative effects. Important gaps in knowledge include: research in small and medium size cities, in overlooked biomes (deserts, xeric shrublands, and montane grasslands and shrublands), long-term research comprising different seasons, the inclusion of green spaces other than urban parks, and interdisciplinary studies that consider environmental, social, and economic components of urban ecosystems. By filling these key knowledge gaps, researchers from South America can contribute to the development of science-based actions to preserve nature in an urbanizing world.

AB  - 1. A systematic review was conducted to gather empirical evidence on movement rates of invertebrates associated with woodland.
   2. Eight scientific literature databases were systematically searched for relevant studies on invertebrates associated with woodland habitat.
   3. Twenty-five studies were identified that met the search selection criteria, which provided estimates of movement rate for 30 invertebrate species associated with woodland habitat. These 30 species represented insect species only, including 17 carabid (ground) beetle, eight butterfly, two bark beetle, two ant, and one moth species. From 2000 to 2008, only six studies were identified, indicating a current lack of dispersal-related studies for woodland invertebrates.
   4. A meta-analysis of studies on ground-dwelling species indicated that carabid beetle species that were strongly associated with woodland habitat were found to move more slowly than more generalist species (median: 2.1 m day(-1) vs. 11.0 m day(-1)). Furthermore, for carabid beetles it was found that body size was positively correlated with movement rate.
   5. The lack of field measurements of movement and dispersal ability for all but a tiny minority of woodland invertebrates indicates a substantial knowledge gap that should be addressed by future research, which might usefully test whether the patterns identified for carabid beetles are generally applicable.

AB  - Indoor farming applications have recently been identified as a potential alternative to contribute to sustainable food production in the urban context. Anyhow, the social impacts of these technologies are still uncertain. The first purpose of this study is to analyse the public perception of indoor farming products and to identify the factors that influence it. The second aim is to assess the positive and negative impacts that these new technologies could have on society. A systematic review of the literature on indoor farming applications was performed to answer these research questions. Following this approach, 40 publications were selected and analysed. The results show that consumers are still uncertain about indoor food production, mainly due to the lack of naturalness. Anyhow, effectively communicating the benefits of these technologies to the public can help to increase their acceptability. Social benefits found in the literature include increased fresh food supply, social integration, revaluation of urban areas, educational opportunities, and added value in terms of the local economy and job creation. To successfully develop from a social point of view indoor farm projects must integrate different functions and carefully evaluate the context in which they are set. The main challenges will be the increase of accessibility, inclusion, and transparency of this production process, as well as gaining financial and political support. Given consumers' uncertainty around these technologies, it seems essential for managers to increase sustainability potential while effectively conveying these benefits to the public. Further quantitative research in this field, as well as policies and regulations, will be needed for market development.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the relationship between a wide range of physical environmental characteristics and different contexts of active transportation in 6- to 12-year-old children across different continents.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted in six databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Cinahl, SportDiscus, TRIS and Cochrane) resulting in 65 papers, eligible for inclusion. The investigated physical environmental variables were grouped into six categories: walkability, accessibility, walk/cycle facilities, aesthetics, safety, recreation facilities.
   Results: The majority of the studies were conducted in North America (n = 35), Europe (n = 17) and Australia (n = 11). Active transportation to school (walking or cycling) was positively associated with walkability. Walking to school was positively associated with walkability, density and accessibility. Evidence for a possible association was found for traffic safety and all forms of active transportation to school. No convincing evidence was found for associations between the physical environment and active transportation during leisure.
   General safety and traffic safety were associated with active transportation to school in North America and Australia but not associated with active transportation to school in Europe.
   Conclusions: The physical environment was mainly associated with active transportation to school. Continent specific associations were found, indicating that safety measures were most important in relation to active commuting to school in North America and Australia. There is a need for longitudinal studies and studies conducted in Asia, Africa and South-America and studies focusing specifically on active transportation during leisure.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as a critical technology for reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere and combating global warming. Public perceptions play a crucial role in shaping the successful deployment of CCS, as individuals hold varying opinions toward implementing novel energy technologies and associated infrastructure. However, compared to established energy systems such as wind power, people's knowledge about CCS remains generally limited. Consequently, a large body of CCS acceptance papers analyze the effects of information on public attitudes and acceptance toward this low-carbon energy solution. Based on 23 identified articles, we conduct a systematic review encompassing the type of study, information provided (baseline and experimental information), information content, the studies' experimental design, information source (written or other), and the effect of information on individuals' perception of CCS. Seven studies find negative information effects, while twelve find positive effects. Information about climate change and natural carbon dioxide fluxes emerge as key drivers for positive CCS information effects. Moreover, we find mixed results regarding the impact of risk information on public attitudes toward CCS across the reviewed studies. Informing about existing CCS projects tends to stimulate public acceptance while providing details on monitoring and safety procedures seems to reduce CCS acceptance. However, only eight of the 23 studies apply a randomized controlled trial design, reducing the causal interpretation of the estimated information effects. Additionally, the focus of the reviewed studies primarily centers on immediate information effects, neglecting the influence of information on long-term attitude development. Furthermore, most studies do not account for possible impacts of information-related factors, e.g., communication mode, framing, and scope. Discussing these limitations underscores the potential of further research to disentangle and explore the multifaceted effects of information provision on public CCS acceptance. Such insights can guide policymakers in developing effective communication strategies for novel low-carbon energy technologies.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide a broad range of ecosystem services, which can be used to justify habitat conservation. The cultural ecosystem services of coastal ecosystems are generally underappreciated, and this is particularly the case when quantifying their scientific value. We created a tiered set of indicators to quantify scientific value spatially, and tested them using the case study of the island nation of Singapore. We conducted a systematic review of research papers, book chapters, conference reports and academic theses produced across 10 coastal ecosystems in Singapore, including mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs, beaches and artificial coastal structures. At least 656 articles have been produced on Singapore's coastal zone, with 2201 unique observations, showing that scientific value is spatially variable along Singapore's coastline. Novel indicators such as the Site Impact Factor are able to differentiate scientific value between sites. This method has shed light on an underrecognised, but important cultural ecosystem service, and is applicable to other spatially-bounded coastal, marine and terrestrial landscapes.

AB  - Safety assessment of road sections and networks have historically relied on police-reported crash data. These data have several noteworthy and significant shortcomings, including under-reporting, subjectivism, post hoc assessment of crash causes and contributing factors, limited behavioural information, and omitted potential important crash-related factors resulting in an omitted variable bias. Moreover, crashes are relatively rare events and require long observation periods to justify expenditures. The rarity of crashes leads to a moral dilemma-we must wait for sufficient crashes to accrue at a site-some involving injuries and even death-to then justify improvements to prevent crashes. The more quickly the profession can end its reliance on crashes to assess road safety, the better.
   Surrogate safety assessment methodologies, in contrast, are proactive in design, do not rely on crashes, and require shorter observation timeframes in which to formulate reliable safety assessments. Although surrogate safety assessment methodologies have been developed and assessed over the past 50 years, an overarching and unifying framework does not exist to date. A unifying framework will help to contextualize the role of various methodological developments and begin a productive discussion in the literature about how the various pieces do or should fit together to understand road user risk better.
   This paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly mapping traffic conflicts and surrogate safety methodologies. A total of 549 studies were meticulously reviewed to achieve this aim of developing a unifying framework. The resulting framework provides a consolidated and up-to-date summary of surrogate safety assessment methodologies and conflict measures and metrics.
   Further work is needed to advance surrogate safety methodologies. Critical research needs to include identifying a comprehensive and reliable set of surrogate measures for risk assessment, establishing rigorous relationships between conflicts and crashes, developing ways to capture road user behaviours into surrogate-based safety assessment, and integrating crash severity measures into risk estimation.

AB  - The need to integrate non-market ecosystem services into decision-making is widely acknowledged. Despite the exponentially growing body of literature, trade-offs between services are still poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review of published literature in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) on the integration of non-market forest ecosystem services into decision-making. The aim of the review was two-fold: (1) to provide an overview of coverage of biophysical and socio-economic assessments of non-market ecosystem services in relation to forest management; (2) to determine the extent of the integration of biophysical and socio-economic models of these services into decision support models. Our findings reveal the need for wider coverage of non-market ecosystem services and evidence-based modelling of how forest management regimes affect ecosystem services. Furthermore, temporal and spatial modelling of ecosystem impacts remains a challenge. We observed a few examples of multiple non-market services assessments. Integration of non-market services into decision support was performed with either biophysical or socio-economic models, often using proxies and composite indicators. The review reveals that there is scope for more comprehensive and integrated model development, including multiple ecosystem services and appropriate handling of forest management impacts.

AB  - Objective To identify and characterize the interventions that aimed to improve cancer treatment and follow-up care in socially disadvantaged groups. To summarize the state of the art for clinicians and researchers. Methods We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with a control group (usual care or enhanced usual care) conducted in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries and published until 2016. Results Thirty-one interventions were identified, the majority of which were conducted in the United States in patients with breast cancer. Most interventions aimed to decrease social inequalities based on ethnicity/race and/or socioeconomic level, with fewer interventions targeting inequalities based on geographical area. The most frequently assessed outcomes were quality of life (n = 20) and psychosocial factors (n = 20), followed by treatment adherence or satisfaction (n = 12,), knowledge (n = 11), pain management (n = 10), and lifestyle habits (n = 3). Conclusions The impact of interventions designed to improve cancer treatment and follow-up care in socially disadvantages groups is multifactorial. Multicomponent-intervention approaches and cultural adaptations are common, and their effectiveness should be evaluated in the populations of interest. More interventions are needed from outside the Unite States and in patients with cancers other than breast cancer, targeting gender or geographical inequalities and addressing key outcomes such as treatment adherence or symptom management.

AB  - Background: Cancer remains the second leading cause of mortality in the United States. Special events such as health fairs, screening days or cultural festivals are employed often for community education about cancer screening. A previous systematic review of the published literature was conducted in 2012-2013. The purpose of this study was to conduct a grey literature component of special events that promote breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening in the U.S.
   Methods: We conducted a grey literature search of dissertations/theses and conference abstracts. The theses/dissertations were restricted to those: 1) written in English, 2) published from January 1990 to December 2011, 3) examined at least one of the predefined categories of special events, 4) involved cancer screening for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer, 5) included outcome data, and 6) conducted in the United States. A review of U.S. public health and cancer conference abstracts, that were readily available and had focused on at least of 3 cancer types and included outcome data, was conducted. Data were abstracted on the purpose, location, primary audience(s), activities conducted, screening provided onsite or referrals, and evaluation results.
   Results: The grey literature review found 6 special events. The types of events found added to the numbers found in the systematic review, especially receptions or parties and cultural festivals/events. All focused on increasing breast and cervical cancer screening except one that focused on breast cancer only. The reach of these events was targeted at mostly minorities or underserved communities. Common evidence-based strategies were group education, small media, and reducing structural barriers. Group education involved presentations from physicians, lay-health advisors, or cancer survivors, while reducing structural barriers included activities such as providing screening appointment sign-ups at the event or providing transportation for event participants. Mammogram screening rates ranged from 6.8% to 60% and Pap tests from 52% to 70%.
   Conclusions: Further evaluation of special events to promote cancer screening will prove their effectiveness. A grey literature review can augment a systematic review of published literature. Additional data about these events through the grey literature offered additional insights into the goals, intervention components and outcomes of interventions.

AB  - Background: Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For fish that require substrate for spawning, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement.
   Methods: Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine, through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews. All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a database. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed quantitatively.
   Review findings: A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percentage (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6 data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on intervention effectiveness for fish abundance.
   Conclusions: The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which spawning habitat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners to improve the quality of evidence being generated.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether perioperative fascia iliaca compartment blockade (FICB) decreases mortality in patients with hip fracture.
   Methods: MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid platforms), Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews were screened for "fascia iliaca compartment block, hip fracture" articles in English, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, from January 1, 2005, to March 1, 2020. All relevant randomized controlled trials and cohort and case-control studies were included for analysis. Relevant article titles were identified, and their corresponding abstracts were independently reviewed by two authors for inclusion. The full-text articles were then obtained for all relevant identified abstracts and assessed for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Conflicts in quality assessment between the two independent reviewers were resolved by a consensus vote of all authors.
   Results: Study quality was assessed objectively using the Jadad and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This meta-analysis was done in accordance with the PRISMA () and QUORUM guidelines. Quantitative synthesis analysis was done using Cochrane Reviews Review Manager (version 5.3). All analyses were completed using random-effects models and comparing the individual effect sizes within each study.
   Discussion: Management of hip fracture pain with FICB does not markedly decrease short-term mortality. Our findings support the continued use of FICB for the management of hip fractures in geriatric patients and suggest the need for future prospective randomized controlled trials to further determine FICB's effect on short-term and long-term mortality and functional status.

AB  - Purpose Cabozantinib is an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been approved in Europe for advanced renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, locally advanced and metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and highly aggressive cutaneous malignant neuroendocrine tumour that usually presents in sun-exposed skin areas of immunosuppressed patients. Conflicting data exist about cabozantinib for MCC and this TKI is currently under investigation in several onco-endocrine frameworks.Methods We herein report a case of an 83-year-old man who was diagnosed with MCC during the treatment of an advanced metastatic MTC. The diagnosis of MCC was established based on clinical, histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry. A systematic review of the literature on cabozantinib use for advanced endocrine and neuroendocrine tumours has been performed.Results The patient was initially treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Cabozantinib was therefore started to control both MTC and MCC. After 24 months, no sign of local or metastatic MCC relapse was evidenced.Conclusion Promising data on cabozantinib treatment for endocrine and neuroendocrine neoplasms is recently emerging in the literature. In our clinical case, we reported that, besides the good response for the MTC, cabozantinib also seems to effectively control metastatic MCC, along with efficient surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Further investigations are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in MCC patients and in off-label endocrine tumours.

AB  - BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests that HbA1c levels, a common clinical indicator of chronic glucose metabolism over the preceding 2-3 months, are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. However, conflicting evidence obscures clear cutoffs of HbA1c levels in various heart failure populations. The aim of this review is to assess the possible predictive value and optimal range of HbA1c on mortality and readmission in patients with heart failure.MethodsA systematic and comprehensive search will be performed using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases before December 2022 to identify relevant studies. All-cause mortality is the prespecified primary endpoint. Cardiovascular death and heart failure readmission are secondary endpoints of interest. We will only include prospective and retrospective cohort studies and place no restrictions on the language, race, region, or publication period. The ROBINS-I tool will be used to assess the quality of each included research. If there were sufficient studies, we will conduct a meta-analysis with pooled relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the possible predictive value of HbA1c for mortality and readmission. Otherwise, we will undertake a narrative synthesis. Heterogeneity and publication bias will be assessed. If heterogeneity was significant among included studies, a sensitivity analysis or subgroup analysis will be used to explore the source of heterogeneity, such as diverse types of heart failure or patients with diabetes and non-diabetes. Additionally, we will conduct meta-regression to examine the time-effect and treatment-effect modifiers on all-cause mortality compared between different quantile of HbA1c levels. Finally, a restricted cubic spline model may be used to explore the dose-response relationship between HbA1c and adverse outcomes.DiscussionThis planned analysis is anticipated to identify the predictive value of HbA1c for mortality and readmission in patients with heart failure. Improved understanding of different HbA1c levels and their specific effect on diverse types of heart failure or patients with diabetes and non-diabetes is expected to be figured out. Importantly, a dose-response relationship or optimal range of HbA1c will be determined to instruct clinicians and patients.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO registration details: CRD42021276067

AB  - Background Physical inactivity is a global problem that increases the risk of many chronic diseases and shortens life expectancy. The built environment contributes to physical inactivity through accessibility of amenities and transportation patterns. With better urban planning, cities could be designed to enhance active transportation and population health on a permanent basis.
   Purpose We conducted a systematic review to identify determinants of the built environment associated with physical activity and to evaluate how changes in the built environment are associated with changes in physical activity.
   Methods We searched six databases, from the inception of each until December 2015, for studies that were written in English, used longitudinal before-and-after design and assessed changes in both the built environment and physical activity. A total of 21 prospective cohort studies and 30 natural experiments were included in the review.
   Results The review showed that changes in the built environment and in physical activity were related. A higher objective accessibility and new infrastructure for walking, cycling and public transportation were associated with increased overall and transportation-related physical activity. Some evidence was found for perceived aesthetics and safety as determinants of physical activity.
   Conclusions Improved objectively measured accessibility of different type of destinations and public transportation and land use mix were associated with increased physical activity. Creating new infrastructure for walking, cycling and public transportation could induce demand for walking and cycling. The results support the creation of compact and diverse residential areas and investments into infrastructure that encourage active modes of transportation.

AB  - This systematic review sheds light on the link between community-based rehabilitation (CBR) approaches and outdoor settings. The aim was to examine and synthesise qualitative knowledge on people with disabilities' and professionals' experiences and perceptions regarding facilitators and barriers to CBR approaches in outdoor settings. The Interpretive Description methodology guided the interpretive synthesis. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The synthesis revealed four themes: Ability to Overcome Challenges, Outdoor Adaptive Activities, Inclusive Social Communities and Culture of Reciprocal Interaction. The link between CBR approaches and outdoor settings seemed to empower participation opportunities and social inclusion of people with disabilities, which stimulated equality among all people involved. However, to transfer potential benefits into society, beyond the formalised programme contexts, more focus is needed on creation of inclusive environments. These inclusive environments entail cultural as well as physical changes together with political commitment.Points of interest People with disabilities are often restricted by physical barriers and misconceptions about their abilities when they attempt to participate in the community. This systematic review found that rehabilitation based in the community with focus on outdoor adaptive activities, gave people with disabilities an opportunity to learn how to overcome challenges of everyday living. Outdoor adaptive activities serve as a social gathering point, where people of all abilities can share experiences and be equally included in social communities. Professionals play a key role to ensure safety and provide social support, but they express a lack of experience and shared direction on what this approach to rehabilitation involves. This study recommends that inclusive environments and political commitment are necessary for a cultural development towards more equality in relations between all people in society.

KW  - Social-environmental systems
KW  - Resource extraction
AB  - Background: Since the 1960s, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and recently, social impact assessments (SIAs), have been conducted during the planning stages of large development projects to identify potential adverse effects and propose mitigation measures to ameliorate these impacts. EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible positive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, including biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
   Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https://osf.io/cvh3u/) and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text. Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts, and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitigation measures from practitioners' knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges including scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners' knowledge.

AB  - Urban areas are growing worldwide and alter landscapes in a persistent fashion, thereby affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination in a little understood way. Here we present a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to identify the drivers of urban pollinator populations and pollination. A total of 141 studies were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed. Pollinator responses to urbanization were contrasting. We contend that positive responses were often associated with urban sprawl, i.e. moderate levels of urbanization of rural, mostly agricultural land below 50% impervious surface, whereas high levels of densification with high percentages of sealed and built-up area (above 50%), largely led to pollinator declines and loss of pollination services. Further, urbanization generally reduced pollinator diversity when compared to natural or semi-natural areas, but enhanced it when compared to intensified agricultural landscapes. In addition, pollinator responses were commonly highly trait- and scale-specific. Cavity nesters and generalist species usually profited more from urbanization than ground nesters and specialists. Overall, urban pollinator communities still seem to provide sufficient pollination services to wild vegetation and crops. Pollinator diversity generally increased with the amount of urban green spaces at the landscape scale, and locally with availability of nesting resources and flowering plants. Positive effects of floral additions were largely independent of the plant's origin, whether native or non-native. Only a few studies included landscape configuration. Likewise, abiotic urban drivers, e.g. heat island effects and air and light pollution, remain little studied. Tropical and developing regions, most heavily impacted by current and future urbanization, are strongly underrepresented. We conclude that biodiversity-friendly urbanization can make a valuable contribution to pollinator conservation, in particular in face of the continued intensification of rural agriculture.

AB  - The red panda is a unique species taxonomically known for its peculiar biological and ecological characteristics, and extreme attractiveness. Despite being highly significant from conservation, scientific and economic perspectives, this species has experienced a declining population in the wild. Thus, to direct further research priorities and conservation actions and assess gaps in the current research trend of this species, a systematic literature review was conducted covering 175 journal articles published in English over 193 years (1827-2020). This review revealed that (1) the biological aspect was highly studied compared to other thematic areas of red panda (2) captive-based studies are relatively higher than the studies based in wild populations (3) China is leading the red panda studies amongst all red panda range (4) The universities were found contributing more to red panda studies than other institutions. Surprisingly, we found that the researchers from the non-range country were leading red panda study than those from range countries. Our review highlighted the need of prioritising studies in underrepresented locations and understudied thematic areas focusing on the assessment of climate change impact, bamboo distribution status, ecosystem services of red panda habitat, behavior and movement ecology, population estimation, and metapopulation dynamics. We urge landscape-level studies and long-term population monitoring. Besides, we also suggest the documentation and evaluation of the effectiveness of ongoing red panda-focused conservation programs. We also stress the need for strengthening the capacity of institutions and people from range countries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smart and sustainable agricultural practices are more complex than other industries as the production depends on many pre- and post-harvesting factors which are difficult to predict and control. Previous studies have shown that technologies such as blockchain along with sustainable practices can achieve smart and sustainable agriculture. These studies state that there is a need for a reliable and trustworthy environment among the intermediaries throughout the agrifood supply chain to achieve sustainability. However, there are limited studies on blockchain technology adoption for smart and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, this systematic review uses the PRISMA technique to explore the barriers and enablers of blockchain adoption for smart and sustainable agriculture. Data was collected using exhaustive selection criteria and filters to evaluate the barriers and enablers of blockchain technology for smart and sustainable agriculture. The results provide on the one hand adoption enablers such as stakeholder collaboration, enhance customer trust, and democratization, and, on the other hand, barriers such as lack of global standards, industry level best practices and policies for blockchain adoption in the agrifood sector. The outcome of this review highlights the adoption barriers over enablers of blockchain technology for smart and sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, several recommendations and implications are presented for addressing knowledge gaps for successful implementation.

In healthcare, the perioperative area has been a leading field in the development of a wide range of checklists. However, clinical literature on this subject is still sparse and heterogeneous, producing results that are sometimes conflicting. This systematic review assesses the current literature on perioperative routine and crisis checklists. Literature searches did not use a date limit and included articles up to March 2019. The methodological heterogeneity precluded combining data from the individual studies into a quantitative meta-analysis. Data are presented by means of a qualitative comparison with the reference groups based on a content analysis approach. Of the 874 identified articles, 25 were included in this review. Most identified studies (23, 92%) have shown that the use of checklists in anaesthesia can decrease human error, improve patient safety and teamwork, and increase quality of care. Beyond the WHO surgical time-out, anaesthesia-specific checklists have been shown to be useful for provider handoffs, emergencies, and routine anaesthesia procedures. However, literature on anaesthesia-specific checklists is still limited and very heterogeneous. More large-scale studies are necessary to identify an ideal anaesthesia checklist and its most appropriate implementation method. (C) 2019 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et de reanimation (Sfar).

AB  - People in developing countries face the difficult task of coping with climate change impacts given their socioeconomic struggles. Gender, along with other social factors, plays divisive roles to regulate people's capacities to respond to climate crises. This paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature to explore the trends of research in developing countries on gender and adaptive capacity concerns. Leximancer was employed to undertake textual analysis of research articles (n = 59) published from 2010 to 2020. Thematic and concept analysis indicated that agriculture-related concerns were the key topic to prompt discussion on gender and adaptive capacities of vulnerable people. Concepts of power, social norms, control over assets, and decision-making processes were found to have a joint effect on the capacity building of vulnerable people, particularly women. The findings suggested that while discussing vulnerability and adaptive capacity of women, the associated subjects of discussion such as income, organization, community, water, food, farming, security, and land vary in African and Asian countries. The growing attention in adaptation research to better understand the opportunities to adequately support women's adaptive capacities will require focusing on a collective approach of incorporating social, cultural, situational, locational and historical contexts of gendered climate vulnerabilities in society.

AB  - Data science and big data analytics (DS & BDA) methodologies and tools are used extensively in supply chains and logistics (SC & L). However, the existing insights are scattered over different literature sources and there is a lack of a structured and unbiased review methodology to systematise DS & BDA application areas in the SC & L comprehensively covering efficiency, resilience and sustainability paradigms. In this study, we first propose an unique systematic review methodology for the field of DS & BDA in SC & L. Second, we use the methodology proposed for a systematic literature review on DS & BDA techniques in the SC & L fields aiming at classifying the existing DS & BDA models/techniques employed, structuring their practical application areas, identifying the research gaps and potential future research directions. We analyse 364 publications which use a variety of DS & BDA-driven modelling methods for SC & L processes across different decision-making levels. Our analysis is triangulated across efficiency, resilience, and sustainability perspectives. The developed review methodology and proposed novel classifications and categorisations can be used by researchers and practitioners alike for a structured analysis and applications of DS & BDA in SC & L.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) is an essential approach to the development of sustainable cities and must be incorporated into urban planning to be able to improve humans' life quality. This paper aimed to identify remote sensing (RS) data/techniques used in the literature in five years (2013-2017) for UES investigation and to analyze the similarity between them. For this purpose, we used the Scopus database of scientific journals, and a set of appropriate filters were applied. A total of 44 studies were selected, being 93.18% of them located in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in Europe. The most common dataset used was the secondary data, followed by the Landsat family products. Land use and land cover (LULC) was the most common approach utilized, succeeded by radiometric indexes and band related. All four main classes (provision, regulation, supporting, and cultural) of ecosystem services (ES) were identified in the reviewed papers, wherein regulating services were the most popular modality mentioned. Seven different groups were established as having 100% of similarity between methods and ES results. Therefore, RS is identified in the literature as an important technique to reach this goal. However, we highlight the lack of studies in the southern hemisphere.

AB  - The Amazonia is suffering consequences due to deforestation, since it is located on the considered path of the advance of the Deforestation Arc, becoming one of the regions that most stands out in deforested areas in Brazil, since it presents vast alterations in natural landscapes due to the agricultural expansion. This work aimed to carry out a systematic bibliographical review on the importance in the production of seedlings that provide forest essences for the Amazon. The bibliographic research was carried out in the following electronic databases: Periodicals Capes, SciELO and Academic Google. It was used as inclusion criterion: original articles and review article, published in international and national periodicals, in the period of the last 10 years. The total of 20 articles were found and from the analysis, the articles were categorized into: Amazon Region, deforestation, production of forest seedlings in the Amazon and reforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, 15 plant species showed potential for the production of seedlings of forest essences. The practice of deforestation causes major environmental impacts on the Amazon ecosystem and the ecosystems that are directly influenced by it. Therefore, the Amazon region has great ecosystemic importance, as it presents great diversity of species. The result of this research will help new works that can mitigate the effects of the practice of deforestation.

AB  - Background: Human wastewater biosolids, hereafter referred to as biosolids, are produced in significant quantities around the world and often applied to an extensive land mass including agricultural fields, forests, mine lands, and urban areas. Land-application of biosolids has been reported in peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed work to change soil organic carbon stocks in varying amounts. Determining the potential of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change and sequestration from biosolids land application is critical for biosolids producers and users to gain access to carbon credit markets. Our review question is, "what is the impact of biosolids application on long-term soil carbon sequestration rates?"We look to explore this main question with the follow-up, "does biosolids processing methods and characteristics, application method, soil properties, land management and other modifiers affect rates of carbon accumulation from land-applied biosolids?"
   Methods: Searches will be conducted using online databases (i.e., Web of Science Core Collection, CAB Abstracts, Scopus, Pro Quest Dissertations &Theses Global), search engines (Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic), and specialist websites to find primary field studies and grey literature of biosolids land-application effects on soil organic carbon stocks. We will use English search terms and predefined inclusion criteria of: (1) a field study of at least 24 months that reports soil organic carbon/matter (SOC/SOM) concentrations/stocks; (2) has two types of treatments: (i) a control (non-intervention AND/OR synthetic fertilizer) AND (ii) a biosolids-based amendment; and (3) information of amendment properties and application dates and rates to estimate the relative contribution of the applied materials to SOC changes. We will screen results in two stages: (1) title and abstract and (2) full text. A 10% subset will be screened by two reviewers for inclusion at the title and abstract level and use a kappa analysis to ensure agreement of at least 0.61. All results in the full text stage will be dual screened. Data will be extracted by one person and reviewed by a second person. Critical appraisal will be used to assess studies' potential bias and done by two reviewers. A meta-analysis using random effects models will be conducted if sufficient data of high enough quality are extracted.

AB  - Conceptual and empirical progress have failed to keep up with growing industry interest in leadership, green innovation, and green creativity in the service industries. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by reviewing the literature on the relationship between leadership and green innovation/creativity. A total of 65 studies indexed in the Scopus database are analyzed. A systematic review and thematic analysis are performed utilizing Leximancer mixed analysis software. Descriptive findings are provided under eight categories: (1) studies by journal, (2) by method, (3) by time, (4) by country, (5) correlations between leadership and green innovation/creativity, (6) commonly used scales of green innovation and creativity, (7) summary of moderators, and (8) summary of mediators between leadership and green innovation/creativity. The findings show that there is a growing interest in the causal relationships among leadership and green innovation/creativity, and that Asian countries dominate the study domain. This study proposes a taxonomy of mediators and moderators. A concept map illustrating the main themes and concepts is also presented, and the study concludes by offering an agenda for future research. This study contributes to a deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying green innovation/creativity in the service context as well as extending research on the leadership-green-innovation/creativity nexus.

AB  - Human societies derive economic benefit from marine systems, yet these benefits may be modified as humans drive environmental change. Here, we conducted the first systematic review of literature on the potential economic effects of ocean acidification. We identified that while there is a growing literature discussing this topic, assessments of the direction and magnitude of anticipated economic change remain limited. The few assessments which have been conducted indicate largely negative economic effects of ocean acidification. Insights are, however, limited as the scope of the studies remains restricted. We propose that understanding of this topic will benefit from using standard approaches (e.g. timescales and emissions scenarios) to consider an increasing range of species/habitats and ecosystem services over a range of spatial scales. The resulting understanding could inform decisions such that we maintain, or enhance, economic services obtained from future marine environments.

AB  - Countries in the developing world are increasingly vulnerable to climate change effects and have a lesser capacity to adapt. Consideration can be given to their indigenous knowledge systems for an integrated approach to education, one which is more holistic and applicable to their context. This paper presents a systematic review of the indigenous knowledge systems (IKSs) deployed for climate change adaptation in the developing world and advances implications for climate change education. A set of inclusion criteria was used to screen publications derived from two databases and grey literature searches, and a total of 39 articles constituted the final selection. Postcolonial theory's lens was applied to the review of the selected publications to highlight indigenous people's agency, despite IKSs' marginalization through colonial encounters and the ensuing epistemic violence. The categories of social adaptation, structural adaptation, and institutional adaptation emerged from the IKS-based climate change adaptation strategies described in the articles, with social adaptation being the most recurrent. We discussed how these strategies can be employed to decolonise climate change education through critical, place-based, participatory, and holistic methodologies. The potential outcome of this is a more relatable and effective climate change education in a developing world context.

AB  - Climate sensitive primary industries including pastoral farming, high-value horticulture and viticulture are central to Aotearoa-New Zealand's economy. While advances have been made in understanding the impacts and implications of climate change critical knowledge gaps remain, particularly for adaptation. This study develops and applies a novel methodology to identify and characterise adaptation knowledge for primary industries. The basis for the review is ten years' of research and action under the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change (SLMACC) program, supplemented with a systematic review of the published literature. Reports (n=32) and literature (n=22) are reviewed and assessed using the Adaptation Knowledge Cycle to characterise analytical and empirical foci. The detailed assessment of knowledge for Impacts, Implications, Decisions or Actions enables a robust and rigorous assessment of existing knowledge, identifies critical research gaps and emerging needs. Results show research to date has focused almost exclusively on understanding the impact of climate variability and extremes on land management. There are significant empirical (e.g. location and sector) and methodological (e.g. integrated assessments, scenarios, and vulnerability assessment) gaps, for at risk regions and sectors, and limited understanding of the decisions and actions necessary to enable successful adaptation. To inform future adaptation planning, additional work is required to better understand the implications, decision-making processes and obstacles to action. More detailed understanding of location-, season-, time- and sector-specific responses to climate change is also necessary. Findings advance our understanding of adaptation knowledge and reflect on diversity of information necessary to enable and sustain resilient rural futures and provide a conceptual and methodological basis for similar assessments elsewhere.

AB  - The rapid escalation of climate change and global warming underscores the critical role of CO2 emissions, necessitating effective mitigation strategies. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising way to address this challenge. It is estimated that CCS could account for 25-67% of emissions reductions in heavy industries. Nonetheless, the realization of large-scale CCS deployment demands a meticulous evaluation of associated risks (e.g., pure and speculative) and uncertainties (e.g., aleatoric, epistemic and Knightian) across the entire process. This review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the risks and uncertainties (R&U), both technical (e.g., oprational and site chractrization) and non-technical (e.g., financial, political and social) inherent in CCS initiatives. Drawing from a diverse array of recent literature sources-including more than 400 CCS-related articles, books, theses, and reports-the analysis spans the period from 2015 to 2023. The methodol-ogy adheres rigorously to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, ensuring methodical precision and coherence. Our analysis indicates that approximately 47% of studies found from 2015 focused on technical R&U in CCS, while the remaining 53% addressed non-technical R&U. This distribution demonstrates a relative equilibrium in the research landscape as depicted in the litera-ture. This review by considering R&U within the CCS landscape can provide crucial insights for engineers and researchers in decarbonization. It serves as a vital guide for navigating intricate challenges in CCS projects. Moreover, administrators and developers can use this knowledge to enhance technological security and cost -efficiency. Ultimately, this paper identifies practical strategies and methodologies that enhance the feasibility of CCS, offering concrete recommendations and suggestions to elevate the success potential of CCS endeavors.

AB  - Nowadays, the growing importance of non-governmental organisations and sustainable employment in the modern labour market is emphasised in the literature on the subject and in economic practice. A systematic review of the literature confirms the lack of research on the sustainable employability of internal NGO stakeholders. Because the issue of sustainable employability in non-governmental organisations is an area that requires exploration, this study attempts to fill this identified research gap. In the context of the stated premises, the analysis and assessment of sustainable employability of internal stakeholders of non-governmental organisations were adopted as the main objective of the article. For this study, a systematic review of literature, and also empirical research, was carried out. The data collection technique in the study was a diagnostic survey method and a Computer -Assisted Web Interview (CAWI). The sustainable employability of internal stakeholders of non-governmental organisations in Poland has been assessed thanks to empirical research. The research results showed that the respondents demonstrated a high level of sustainable employability. In addition, the respondents were assessed using various organizational solutions aimed at developing sustainable employability in the modern labour market. The obtained research results complement the diagnosed gap in knowledge, indicating that the respondents considered health prevention programs a priority solution to ensure ergonomic and safe working conditions for people of different ages.

AB  - This study presents a critical literature review on the tourist attitude-behavior gap and intention-behavior gap in sustainable tourism research and proposes future research directions. A systematic review was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) on the existing literature from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Key research topics in attitude-behavior gaps are the role of environmental knowledge, protected area management, the role of service quality, risk perception, moral licensing, sustainability communication, business owners in tourism, environmental concern, tourist psychology, and intervention. Key research topics in the intention-behavior gaps of sustainable tourism are green certification or label, value, rationality and social desirability, motivation, trust, inconvenience, and quality. Four emerging research trends were discovered in recent years: (1) increased use of mixed methods and surveys; (2) consideration of green or environmental knowledge; (3) role of green certification; and (4) consideration of tourist moral values. Recommended future research directions include theoretical development studies in the hospitality sector, cross-cultural comparisons, investigation, of under-researched tourism sectors, and new research methodologies. This review provides an overview of research on the attitude-behavior gap and the intention-behavior gap in sustainable tourism. Our study proposes a new framework for the attitude-behavior gap and the intention-behavior gap, departing from the theory of planned behavior. We identify direct and indirect factors that influence sustainable tourist behavior, with sustainable tourist attitude and intention serving as mediators. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the complex relationship between attitudes, intentions, and behaviors in sustainable tourism.

AB  - The application of lighting technologies developed in the 20th century has increased the brightness and changed the spectral composition of nocturnal night-time habitats and night skies across urban, peri-urban, rural, and pristine landscapes, and subsequently, researchers have observed the disturbance of biological rhythms of flora and fauna. To reduce these impacts, it is essential to translate relevant knowledge about the potential adverse effects of artificial light at night (ALAN) from research into applicable urban lighting practice. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify and report, via a systematic review, the effects of exposure to different physical properties of artificial light sources on various organism groups, including plants, arthropods, insects, spiders, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and non-human mammals (including bats, rodents, and primates). PRISMA 2020 guidelines were used to identify a total of 1417 studies from Web of Science and PubMed. In 216 studies, diverse behavioral and physiological responses were observed across taxa when organisms were exposed to ALAN. The studies showed that the responses were dependent on high illuminance levels, duration of light exposure, and unnatural color spectra at night and also highlighted where research gaps remain in the domains of ALAN research and urban lighting practice. To avoid misinterpretation, and to define a common language, key terminologies and definitions connected to natural and artificial light have been provided. Furthermore, the adverse impacts of ALAN urgently need to be better researched, understood, and managed for the development of future lighting guidelines and standards to optimize sustainable design applications that preserve night-time environment(s) and their inhabiting flora and fauna.

AB  - Unsustainable practices in the land use sector contribute to climate change through the release of greenhouse gases. Payment for environmental services (PESs) provide economic incentives to reduce the negative environmental impacts of land use and are a popular approach to mitigate climate change in low- and middle-income countries. Some PES programmes also aim to improve socioeconomic outcomes and reduce poverty. This systematic review examines the effect of programmes on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. We identified 44 quantitative impact evaluations and 60 qualitative studies of PES programmes for inclusion in the review, to assess both the effects of PES and identify context, design and implementation features that may influence PES effectiveness. The studies covered 18 programmes from 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The review finds that PES may increase household income, reduce deforestation and improve forest cover, but the findings are, however, based on low and very low quality evidence from a small number of programmes and should be treated with caution. Qualitative evidence indicates that several factors influence whether PES programmes are likely to be effective in different contexts and suggests that the inclusion of strong governance structures and the effective targeting of both locations and participants may improve intervention effectiveness. Funders, implementing agencies and researchers should collaborate to develop a coordinated programme of rigorous, mixed-methods impact evaluation implemented across contexts. Until such evidence is available, PES programmes remain a high-risk strategy for climate change mitigation.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) have become an important driver of biodiversity change and exert severe pressure on natural ecosystems. The development of modelling approaches to assess and predict their distributions and impacts, and evaluate management options has increased substantially. We reviewed these modelling approaches, applied in aquatic ecosystems, using a systematic review approach in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. According to our results, multispecies/ecosystem models dominated the applications, with dynamic and non-spatial models being the most prevalent. Most of the models included an additional stressor, mainly fisheries, climate change or nutrient loading. The impacts on biota focused on predation, but also on competition and ecosystem functioning, while the impacts on ecosystem services focused on food provision and water purification. At species/population level, most of the studies reported negative impacts; while at multispecies/ecosystem level, negative and both negative and positive impacts were similarly represented. We reflect on the ability of current models to assess different impacts of IAS populations and highlight the need to advance their capabilities to predict future impacts. Further development of models that allow capturing the arrival, establishment and spread of IAS and assess their impacts in an integrated way is still needed. Spatial-temporal modelling techniques bridging with novel analytical capabilities (such as environmental DNA to investigate the presence of IAS and metabarcoding and machine learning to predict future trophic behavior and distributions) may be the key for future achievement.

AB  - Palliative care encompasses supportive health care for patients at any stage of illness aimed at relieving symptoms, controlling pain, managing stress, offering respite for caregivers, and optimizing the quality of life. To explore strategies for increasing access to palliative care among individuals living in remote/rural communities, a rapid review was conducted on studies that explored the use of telehealth applications with this population. From December 2019 to February 2020, the PRISMA methodology was used to gather peer-reviewed studies published in the English language. MedLine, Google Scholar, and EBSCO were searched; no date limitations were set. Given the diversity of study methodologies and outcomes, the findings were synthesized narratively. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was also employed. Lastly, the studies were mapped to clinical guidelines for the various aspects of quality palliative care. The 18 studies found, published between 2004 and 2019, were conducted in seven countries and on five continents. Aims included evaluating feasibility, efficacy, and user satisfaction. Insights draw from a combined pool of 3,313 patients and 250 providers. Most studies involved oncology patients and employed videoconferencing or a web platform/online software with videoconferencing. Three themes emerged: delivery of care, symptom management and quality of life, and patient/caregiver/provider satisfaction levels. Telehealth proved effective for patient and medication monitoring, provider and specialist appointments, and palliative care consultations. Operational benefits included clinician time saved, shorter appointment wait times, and reduced no show rates; implementation challenges also emerged. Statistical improvements in quality of life and symptom management were reported. Nearly two-thirds of the studies reported positive experiences among patients, caregivers, and providers; about half included an interprofessional team. The studies primarily focused on the structure/process and physical aspects of quality palliative care, there was a paucity of insights on the spiritual, cultural, end of life, and ethical/legal aspects of care. Two-thirds (12/18) of the studies employed a descriptive design. Risk for selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases emerged for all the studies; for example, only four of the studies included control groups and less than 20% (3/18) reported on attrition of study participants. Additional limitations include the rapid review methodology which relied heavily on the lead author's decisions and the restriction of studies published only in the English language. More rigorous research is required to confirm the viability of clinical care delivery and establish best practices for quality, virtual palliative care to remote/rural areas.

AB  - As an essential part of ecosystem services, the rural ecosystem service (rES) plays an irreplaceable role in sustainable development. However, research on rESs still needs improvement compared with urban ecosystem services. Aiming at analyzing the research and development trends in rES, three types of bibliometric analysis software, HistCite, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace, are applied to reveal and visualize the research status and the prospect of existing research. The results show that since 2015, there has been a significant increase in the number of countries, papers, and institutions studying rES. There are five main research areas, among which urbanization and nature's contribution to people (NCP) are ongoing. Moreover, the research content gradually shifted from fundamental studies on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services to the relationships between different stakeholders and rESs against the background of complex social relations and cultural settings in urbanization. However, there is still a lack of leading ancestor literature in the field, and this field still needs to be developed.

Breast NF is often misdiagnosed because of the thick breast tissue between the skin and deep fascia. Only early diagnosis followed by prompt antibiotic treatment and surgical therapy can prevent disastrous consequences. There are many case reports on breast NF, but a systematic review is lacking. Methods:Using PubMed and Scopus we performed a systematic review of the literature covering a period of 20 years. We reviewed articles with predisposing comorbidities (risk factors), triggering factors, laboratory examinations, culture of organisms, antibiotic treatment, surgical interventions, the presence of septic shock, and final outcome. We also performed statistical tests of all these factors in relation to death. Results:Forty cases identified from 38 articles were included in our literature review. Twenty-one cases (52.5%) were primary, whereas 15 cases (37.5%) occurred after surgery. In 15 cases (37.5%), the single organism responsible for NF wasStreptococcus pyogenes, whereas mixed organisms were found in 17 cases (42.5%). Surgical debridement was performed in 39 (97.5%) cases. Septic shock was found in all five (12.5%) deceased cases and was associated with patient's mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusions:Breast NF is a rare, severe, and easily misdiagnosed complication. Breast NF could differ from that in other body regions in etiology pattern and clinical manifestations. Confirmed diagnosis of breast NF is based on the combination of clinical, cultural, laboratory, and imaging findings. Urgent subsequent treatments, including surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and reconstructive surgery, are critical for better prognosis and survival of patients.

AB  - Human activities have resulted in higher levels of turbidity in aquatic systems due to increased sediment runoff from agriculture, urbanization, and mining activities into nearby water bodies. Previous research has suggested that as turbidity increases, fish may increase their mobility to counteract the reduction in low visual acuity and maintain prey consumption similar to those in clear water. However, other studies have reported negative and non-significant relationships between turbidity and fish mobility. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of turbidity on fish mobility. We analysed potential sources of variation in the turbidity-fish mobility relationships (moderators), such as body size, eye size and the trophic position of fish, as well as turbidity type, range and ecosystem types, while also accounting for phylogenetic relationships among fish species. Our results revealed that the overall effect size of turbidity on fish mobility was not significantly different from zero, indicating that turbidity does not consistently affect fish mobility. Instead, some fish species may increase their mobility, while others decrease or remain unchanged. Furthermore, the effects of turbidity on fish mobility varied greatly among studies. However, none of the moderators tested explained such variability in the turbidity-fish mobility relationships. These findings demonstrate that the effects of turbidity on fish movements are complex and that some fish species and populations may be particularly vulnerable to increasing turbidity levels in water bodies worldwide caused by human activities.

AB  - Agri-environmental schemes (AESs) are increasingly implemented to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices by farmers. We use a systematic review to explore the role of behavioural factors and opportunity costs in farmers' decisions to participate in AESs in Australia, Europe and North America. Behavioural factors influence how farmers value and perceive options, while opportunity costs relate to farmers' forgone utility when choosing to participate in schemes. We synthesise insights from 79 articles and over 700 factors explaining the participation in AESs. We find that a set of behavioural factors seem consistently connected to participation, including agricultural training, advice and having positive attitudes towards AESs. Moreover, several factors related to opportunity costs also have a rather consistent relationship with AES participation, including market conditions, implementation efforts, profitability, and management and contract flexibility. However, many relationships of behavioural factors and opportunity costs with AES participation are not as consistent and generalizable as sometimes portrayed and require context-specific interpretation. Those factors with mixed results can still provide insights into farmers' participation decisions as several of them are either 'positively and insignificantly' or 'negatively and insignificantly' related to participation, such as environmental attitude, trust and farm size. These results suggest that their relationship with AES participation depends on other factors or the setting, highlighting interactions and raising important new research questions. Overall, our results provide several entry points for both researchers and policy-makers, highlighting uncertainties in relationships between factors and participation that should be considered when designing policies.

AB  - The Village-Owned Enterprises (VOE) are established with the capital provided by the central government of Indonesia, managed by the village government in collaboration with the self-reliant rural community in terms of the economy, but not optimal in operation. On the other hand, in the fourth quarter of 2022 the Indonesian economy is growing, with more than half growing in Java, while poverty is increasing in rural Indonesia. Throughout 2022 VOEs have not been operating at their maximum potential. These issues should have been addressed with the establishment of VOEs. The aim of this research is providing a formula for the village government to develop the rural economy through the presence of VOEs. The research methodology follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The materials used in this paper were collected online from existing publications. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of VOEs, classifying the literature into three system-based themes: antecedents, processes, and consequences. The research findings indicate that VOEs have limited operations in rural areas due to financial constraints and local leadership issues. Consequently, BUMDes operations damage the rural environment for the sake of economic improvement activities. The aim of this research is providing a formula for the village government to develop the rural economy through the presence of VOEs. The recommendation is to introduce further research that can expand the boundaries in developing environmentally sustainable VOEs in the future, without destroying the natural environment for the sake of improving the rural economy.

AB  - Background: The healthcare sector is responsible for 4%-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Considering the broad range of care that obstetricians and gynaecologists provide, mitigation strategies within this specialty could result in significant reductions of the environmental footprint across the whole healthcare industry.Objectives: The aim of this review was to identify for what services, procedures and products within obstetric and gynaecological care the environmental impact has been studied, to assess the magnitude of such impact and to identify mitigation strategies to diminish it.Search strategy: The search strategy combined terms related to environmental impact, sustainability, climate change or carbon footprint, with the field of obstetrics and gynaecology.Selection criteria: Articles reporting on the environmental impact of any service, procedure or product within the field of obstetrics and gynaecology were included. Included outcomes covered midpoint impact categories, CO2 emissions, waste generation and energy consumption.Data collection and analysis: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and Scopus, and a grey literature search was performed on Google Scholar and two websites of gynaecological associations.Main results: The scope of the investigated studies encompassed vaginal births, obstetric and gynaecological surgical procedures, menstrual products, vaginal specula and transportation to gynaecological oncologic consultations. Among the highest yielding mitigation strategies were displacing disposable with reusable materials and minimising content of surgical custom packs. The lowest yielding mitigation strategy was waste optimisation, including recycling.Conclusions: This systematic review highlights opportunities for obstetricians and gynaecologists to decrease their environmental footprint in many ways. More high-quality studies are needed to investigate the environmental impact of other aspects of women's and reproductive health care.

AB  - The Belt and Road (B&R) initiative was introduced by the Chinese government to promote the worldwide economic development and multilateral cooperation between China and the associated countries. As a crucial part of global supply chains, transportation plays a key role to ensure the implementation of the B&R. Safety is one of the issues with great importance in transportation research. However, its foci have been expanded from traditional risk through security to resilience and sustainability. Resilience has attracted considerable interests from both researchers and practitioners across different research domains in recent years. Various studies have been conducted on transportation resilience from different perspectives. Consequently, different definitions have been developed to define and describe resilience. This paper presents a systematic review on transportation resilience with emphasis on its definitions, characteristics, and research methods applied in different transportation systems/contexts. It aims to figure out what transportation resilience is and what kind of essential characters it usually has. More importantly, research challenges are analysed and a future research agenda on the resilience of transportation systems is proposed. This paper will provide comprehensive insights into understanding the transportation resilience, as well as establish new horizons for relevant research topics within the context of the B&R.

AB  - Background: Data breaches in health care are on the rise, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to mitigation efforts.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive framework for modeling and analyzing health care professionals' information security practices related to their individual characteristics, such as their psychological, social, and cultural traits.
   Methods: The study area was a hospital setting under an ongoing project called the Healthcare Security Practice Analysis, Modeling, and Incentivization (HSPAMI) project. A literature review was conducted for relevant theories and information security practices. The theories and security practices were used to develop an ontology and a comprehensive framework consisting of psychological, social, cultural, and demographic variables.
   Results: In the review, a number of psychological, social, and cultural theories were identified, including the health belief model, protection motivation theory, theory of planned behavior, and social control theory, in addition to some social demographic variables, to form a comprehensive set of health care professionals' characteristics. Furthermore, an ontology was developed from these theories to systematically organize the concepts. The framework, called the psychosociocultural (PSC) framework, was then developed from the various combined psychological and sociocultural attributes of the ontology. The Human Aspect of Information Security Questionnaire was adopted as a comprehensive tool for gathering staff security practices as mediating variables in the framework.
   Conclusions: Data breaches occur often in health care today. This frequency has been attributed to the lack of experience of health care professionals in information security, the lack of development of conscious care security practices, and the lack of motivation to incentivize health care professionals. The frequent data breaches in health care threaten the mutual trust between health care professionals and patients, which implicitly impacts the quality of the health care service. The modeling and analysis of health care professionals' security practices can be conducted with the PSC framework by combining methods of statistical survey, observations, and interviews in relation to PSC variables, such as perceptions (perceived benefits, perceived threats, and perceived barriers) or psychological traits, social factors, cultural factors, and social demographics.

AB  - Objective Physical and natural environments might strongly influence mental health and well-being. Many studies have examined this relationship in urban environments, with fewer focused on rural settings. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise quantitative evidence for the relationship between environmental factors (drought, climate and extreme weather events, land use/environmental degradation, green space/vegetation, engagement in natural resource management activities) and mental health or well-being in rural areas. Design Following a systematic search of three databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science), 4368 articles were identified, of which 28 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. Results Poorer mental health and well-being was typically found to have an association with extreme climate or weather events and environmental degradation. The observed relationships were largely assessed at area-wide or community levels. Conclusions Studies examining the relationship between the environmental condition of land and mental health at an individual level, particularly within farms, are lacking. Addressing this gap in research requires interdisciplinary expertise and diverse methodology. Few studies examined the effects of natural resource management practices/principles or biodiversity on mental health. While there is evidence that extreme climate or weather events have a negative impact on mental health in rural areas, there remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of how rural environments influence mental health and well-being.

AB  - Plant functional trait frameworks have been increasingly used to understand plant community dynamics, linkages between plants and ecosystem function, and have recently been applied to inform species selection for restoration of many ecosystem types. Yet, despite rapid development in this field over the past decade, the use of plant functional trait frameworks in the context of wetland restoration remains limited. Ambitious wetland restoration goals, and previous difficulties to meet them, underscore the need for continued refinement of science-backed restoration approaches for present and future conditions. Plant functional traits are one approach that deserves additional attention and scientific inquiry to inform restoration in wetlands. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (published 2000 to 2020) addressing plant functional traits in wetland restoration. Here, we summarize that body of literature and identify factors limiting the inclusion of plant functional trait frameworks in wetland restoration. We emphasize the need for consensus on terminology and trait selection in this field, provide definitive guidelines for moving this field forward for both researchers and practitioners, identify key plant functional traits to inform specific restoration goals, and highlight case studies exemplary of this approach in wetland restoration. A plant functional trait framework has the potential to inform and improve restoration of the world's wetlands by making important linkages between traits, desired ecosystem functions, and restoration trajectories. However, the use of this approach requires further development and that both research and practice reach a consensus on which traits are most critical to measure.

AB  - Identifying and quantifying ecotourism opportunities are critical processes in sustainable tourism planning, which is challenging, since ecotourism is a Complex Adaptive System (CAS). This study investigated Ecotourism Opportunities Measurements (EOMs) in the literature and mapped the research trends to provide practical implications for research in this area. A systematic quantitative literature review began with a scientometric analysis in CiteSpace to examine the existing knowledge and the state of the art in EOMs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was then applied to refine the initial search results, and snowballing was used to collect additional articles. The refined set was then thematically coded and quantitatively analyzed. Our findings show that existing studies on ecotourism opportunities predominantly focus on the impacts of ecotourism on the environment, stakeholders' contributions toward ecotourism development, sustainability, and responsible behavior of local communities in ecotourism promotion. In addition, five dimensions have been identified under which ecotourism opportunities can be measured, including nature, environmental education/protection, sustainability, socio-cultural benefits, and tourist satisfaction. Existing scales or indices assess potential destinations qualitatively rather than quantitatively. In contrast, an index-based approach might help to solve the challenges of evaluating ecotourism opportunities as a CAS, as well as to quantitatively assess potential destinations to support decision-making related to ecotourism promotion.

AB  - Research in Big Data and analytics offers tremendous opportunities to utilize evidence in making decisions in many application domains. To what extent can the paradigms of Big Data and analytics be used in the domain of transport? This article reports on an outcome of a systematic review of published articles in the last five years that discuss Big Data concepts and applications in the transportation domain. The goal is to explore and understand the current research, opportunities, and challenges relating to the utilization of Big Data and analytics in transportation. The review shows the potential of Big Data and analytics to garner insights and improve transportation systems through the analysis of various forms of data obtained from traffic monitoring systems, connected vehicles, crowdsourcing, and social media. We discuss some platforms and software architecture for the transport domain, along with a wide array of storage, processing, and analytical techniques, and describe challenges associated with the implementation of Big Data and analytics. This review contributes broadly to the various ways in which cities can utilize Big Data in transportation to guide the creation of sustainable and safer traffic systems. Since research in Big Data and transportation is, by and large, at infancy, this article does not prescribe recommendations to the various challenges identified, which also constitutes the limitation of the article.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have emerged as essential tools in the equipment of many ecologists, useful to explore species distributions in space and time and answering an assortment of questions related to biogeography, climate change biology and conservation biology. Historically, most SDM research concentrated on well-known organisms, especially vertebrates. In recent years, these tools are becoming increasingly important for predicting the distribution of understudied invertebrate taxa. Here, we reviewed the literature published on main terrestrial arthropod predators (ants, ground beetles and spiders) to explore some of the challenges and opportunities of species distribution modelling in mega-diverse arthropod groups. Location Global. Methods Systematic mapping of the literature and bibliometric analysis. Results Most SDM studies of animals to date have focused either on broad samples of vertebrates or on arthropod species that are charismatic (e.g. butterflies) or economically important (e.g. vectors of disease, crop pests and pollinators). We show that the use of SDMs to map the geography of terrestrial arthropod predators is a nascent phenomenon, with a near-exponential growth in the number of studies over the past ten years and still limited collaborative networks among researchers. There is a bias in studies towards charismatic species and geographical areas that hold lower levels of diversity but greater availability of data, such as Europe and North America. Conclusions Arthropods pose particular modelling challenges that add to the ones already present for vertebrates, but they should also offer opportunities for future SDM research as data and new methods are made available. To overcome data limitations, we illustrate the potential of modern data sources and new modelling approaches. We discuss areas of research where SDMs may be combined with dispersal models and increasingly available phylogenetic and functional data to understand evolutionary changes in ranges and range-limiting traits over past and contemporary time-scales.

AB  - Continuous population growth, global warming, extreme weather and local wars pose considerable challenges to agricultural production. Excessive agricultural intensification may lead to serious environmental problems such as water resources depletion and non-point source pollution. Sustainable agricultural intensification is a potential solution, and cropping intensity and its spatio-temporal patterns are of great significance to the planet hearth, human well-being and sustainable development of agriculture. However, traditional methods for cropping in-tensity mapping lack the deep analysis of crop phenology and failure to consider the spatial detail, spatial coverage and time continuity simultaneously. Existing cropping intensity indicators, such as cropping frequency or multiple crop index, have their limitations in China because of its diverse topographies and fragmented landscapes. In actual fact, few indicators for fine cropping intensity have been developed that address this problem. Time series vegetation index data contain meaningful vegetation phenology information. Information mining on these data can provide new insights for cropping intensity mapping. In this study, the concept of systematic mapping was put forward to measure cropping intensity with a fresh perspective. A new phenology-based cropping intensity index (PCII) was proposed to reach the goal of "from frequency to intensity" in cropping intensity mapping. Through thoroughly exploring the temporal spectral characteristics of croplands and considering the crop pattern as a whole, PCII set up the mapping between cropping intensity and land-cover types. The method can accurately map cropping intensity even though the study spanned a vast area, and can handle the effects of geographical differentiation caused by vegetation phenology differences. It can also pre-cisely measure cropping intensity at the abundance level and reflect the heterogeneity within a pixel. It's a novel method for annual fine cropping intensity mapping at large-scale and long-term.

AB  - The use of botanical extracts of the plant Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) represents a valuable alternative to control insect pests and avoid the detrimental effects on the environment and health that arise due to synthetic chemical insecticides. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the published evidence on the bioactivity of J. curcas against insect pests. Electronic databases were searched to identify studies that assessed J. curcas extracts against insect pests in various types of crops. We included 39 articles that reported the insecticidal and insectistatic activity of several botanical extracts from J. curcas against insects of eight different taxonomic orders. The evidence demonstrates that aqueous and methanolic extracts from seeds and leaves, seed oil, and petroleum ether seed extracts were effective against insect pests of stored grains, aphids of cabbage and sorghum, fruit flies, and desert locusts. The extracts caused high mortality, controlled the populations, reduced oviposition, diminished hatchability, and increased the antifeedant effect. However, the type of solvent used to obtain the botanical extract and the method of application (contact or food) are fundamental to increase its bioactivity. Therefore, botanical extracts from seeds and leaves of J. curcas should be considered as an alternative against insect pests and may be incorporated into integrative and sustainable management for insect control.

AB  - Climate smart agriculture (CSA) is a potential approach for promoting a net-zero economy. CSA is one of the key approaches that can provide a sufficient agri-food supply to feed a rapidly increasing population with minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Net-zero is an intrinsic approach to tackling the adverse effects of climate change that ensures minimum GHG emissions and removes GHG from the atmosphere with maximum production in all possible sectors, including agriculture. As an important global issue, the relationship between CSA and a net-zero economy deserves further investigation. Therefore, this study explores the potential of CSA to promote a net-zero economy. A mixed method comprising a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided systematic review of the most relevant document selection and a narrative review substantiated this argument. This study reveals that the key components of CSA (productivity, adaptation, and mitigation) can ensure emitting less GHG and capturing GHG from the atmosphere. They also argue that the transition from conventional practice-based agriculture to CSA increases economic returns. Land management practices, such as zero tillage, minimal tillage, crop residue decomposition, cover crops, and planting legumes, provide increased economic benefits. Although agroforestry generates comparatively low economic returns, it has the most significant potential for removing GHG from the atmosphere. CSA ensures sustainability in terms of economic benefits, social cohesiveness, and environmentally friendly practices by integrating climate resilience. These findings will be helpful in understanding practical approaches to address the challenges of creating an agricultural-based economy and taking the initiative for agricultural resilience.

AB  - Organic agriculture can play a pivotal role in addressing different challenges (e.g. poverty, biodiversity loss, climate change). However, organic agriculture is `knowledge intensive' and its development requires investments in research and innovation. This systematic review casts light on research on organic food and farming (OFF) in West-Africa. It draws upon a search performed in April 2020 on the Web of Science. An overview of both biblio-metrics and topics addressed in the analysed literature is provided. The analysed literature indicates that organic agriculture can support climate change mitigation and adaptation, conserve bio-diversity and reduce environmental impacts. However, the comparative performance of organic farming is site-specific. Similarly, the organic-conventional yield gap depends, inter alia, on crops and cropping practices. Furthermore, different factors hinder the development of OFF in West Africa, which include agricultural policy, agronomic research, institutional environment and extension management, among others. The study concludes that organic agriculture is poorly developed in West Africa. Therefore, it is recommended that awareness on OFF should be raised, organic farmers supported and research on organic farming strengthened to fill the existing knowledge gap and unlock the sector potential.

AB  - Silvoarable systems (SAS) are agroforestry systems (AFS) that combine the cultivation of trees and arable crops. Often, rows of trees delineate crop alleys in a field (alley-cropping system). SAS have the potential to provide many agricultural and environmental benefits, are innovative in their modern form, and are becoming more widespread. These diversified farming systems have the potential to influence biodiversity and related ecosystem services (ES). This systematic review seeks to assess the link between temperate SAS and biodiversity at all main taxonomical levels (bacteria and fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). We describe the response of biodiversity in terms of abundance, species richness and other diversity indices. This study concerns not only the potential interest of these systems for biodiversity conservation, but also the impacts of living organisms present in the system on ES and eventually ecosystem disservices. We obtained 3458 references dealing with both agroforestry and biodiversity from the Web of Sciences database. Among them, 45 articles corresponded to our specific subject and met the selection criteria. These publications were retained for further analysis. SAS have a positive impact on biodiversity conservation by increasing the abundance or diversity of the different taxonomic groups. Regarding ES, the few papers that studied the effect on pollinators or pollination also showed a positive effect. The majority of studies on natural predators and biocontrol and most of those concerning soil organisms and related supporting services showed a positive effect of SAS. However, some studies found no positive effect or even reported a negative effect in specific conditions. Data is limited for weeds, pests and damage to crop production, and results contrast according to studies and conditions. The review lists the different parameters that influence biodiversity and the subsequent services. These parameters can be divided into three main groups, namely crop management, the influence of the crop location, and agroforestry management. We also report the influence of the experimental design, for example the use of control and comparison or sampling methods.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) offers new technologies in the precision agriculture domain with its intelligent algorithms and strong computation. Oil palm is one of the rich crops that is also emerging with modern technologies to meet global sustainability standards. This article presents a comprehensive review of research dedicated to the application of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry over the last decade (2011-2020). A systematic review was structured to answer seven predefined research questions by analysing 61 papers after applying exclusion criteria. The works analysed were categorized into two main groups: (1) regression analysis used to predict fruit yield, harvest time, oil yield, and seasonal impacts and (2) classification techniques to classify trees, fruit, disease levels, canopy, and land. Based on defined research questions, investigation of the reviewed literature included yearly distribution and geographical distribution of articles, highly adopted algorithms, input data, used features, and model performance evaluation criteria. Detailed quantitative-qualitative investigations have revealed that ML is still underutilised for predictive analysis of oil palm. However, smart systems integrated with machine vision and artificial intelligence are evolving to reform oil palm agri-business. This article offers an opportunity to understand the significance of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry and provides a roadmap for future research in this domain.

AB  - Bridge infrastructure has great economic, social, and cultural value. Nevertheless, many of the infrastructural assets are in poor conservation condition as has been recently evidenced by the collapse of several bridges worldwide. The objective of this systematic review is to collect and synthesize state-of-the-art knowledge and information about how bridge information modeling, finite element modeling, and bridge health monitoring are combined and used in the creation of digital twins (DT) of bridges, and how these models could generate damage scenarios to be used by anomaly detection algorithms for damage detection on bridges, especially in bridges with cultural heritage value. A total of 76 relevant studies from 2017 up to 2022 have been taken into account in this review. The synthesis results show a consensus toward the future adoption of DT for bridge design, management, and operation among the scientific community and bridge practitioners. The main gaps identified are related to the lack of software interoperability, the required improvement of the performance of anomaly-detection algorithms, and the approach definition to be adopted for the integration of DT at the macro scale. Other potential developments are related to the implementation of Industry 5.0 concepts and ideas within DT frameworks.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of research studies on the drivers and consequences of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach This paper used a systematic literature review using research papers published on the drivers and consequence of global CSR from 2010 to 2020. Findings The findings of this paper show that the principal themes of published research articles on the drivers and consequences of CSR are internal drivers, external drivers and consequences of CSR. Publications on the drivers and consequences of global CSR have been dominated by studies that used quantitative approach and cross-sectional design. A significant number of studies also used secondary data source with most of these studies not being sensitive to sectorial influences. More importantly, this study revealed that the emphasis of CSR on actions that demonstrate social responsibility is more associated with overall financial performance and firm value when contrasted against ethical statements of social responsibility which is associated with weaker firm financial performance and outcomes. Moreover the review indicated that the level of CSR engagement and disclosure has been associated with higher share prices whereas low level of CSR disclosure in sensitive industries results in lower share prices. In addition, employees' intention has been identified as a critical driver for CSR activities. Furthermore, it was also identified that firms engage in CSR because of internal institutional factors such as ethical corporate culture and top management commitment, whereas external drivers of CSR include socio-political factors, globalisation and environmental accountability. Practical implications CSR is an area that can be harnessed to contribute to sustainable solutions to global challenges. It also provides an added advantage of ensuring that the perpetuation of the relationship between businesses and society are more complementary. Originality/value This review is one of the few studies focussed on highlighting the drivers and consequences of global CSR. This review also provides proof of the areas of research that need attention and provides recommendation on future areas of study on the drivers and consequences of global CSR.

AB  - Impact evaluation aims to estimate the effect of an intervention on intended, and perhaps unintended, outcomes compared to the outcomes of no intervention or different intervention. Traditional impact evaluation methods used in environmental sciences tend to compare protected and control areas that differ in several characteristics, thereby hampering the attribution of causality such as lower rates of deforestation occurring as consequence of protection. To overcome this problem, counterfactual methods have been developed to improve impact evaluation in environmental sciences, including studies that aim to measure the effects of protected areas in avoiding deforestation. The goal of counterfactual methods is achieved by identification of carefully selected and comparable control areas. Here, we report on a systematic review to evaluate whether estimates about the effectiveness of protected area differ between traditional and counterfactual impact evaluation methods. We found that estimates from traditional methods of avoided deforestation due to the establishment of protected areas were generally higher than those from counterfactual methods. However, estimates based on traditional linear models and multivariate ordinations were similar to those obtained by counterfactual methods. Although rarely used, linear methods and ordinations appear promising as parts of the impact evaluation toolbox, although their limitations need to be better understood.

AB  - Supporting older people's use of sustainable transport is important for both population health and sustainable development, especially in the context of global population ageing. This systematic review identifies individual and environmental factors that influence older people's sustainable transport use and synthesises findings using a framework approach. Factors influencing older people's walking (n = 10 studies), bus use (n = 11), community transport use (n = 1), bicycling (n = 1), and e-bicycling (n = 1) were found to be physical, geographical, facility-based, economic, time-based, fear-based, space-based, information-based, or interpersonal. Many factors were common across transport modes. One reason for this is that environmental features designed to facilitate the use of one particular transport mode also influenced the use of other modes (e.g., bus shelters influence not only bus use but also walking as they provide pedestrian seating). Thus, environments need to be considered from the perspective of multiple, different types of road users. Another reason is that many factors related to the ways individuals experienced their environment (e.g., finding information guiding behaviour in public spaces to be unclear), regardless of any specific transport mode. This review highlights the important need for greater cross-sectoral action and input from older people.

AB  - Production systems that do not use environmentally sustainable practices are being pressured to change their production strategies. Conventional agricultural practices are associated with negative impacts, such as extensive land use, soil contamination, pesticide usage, and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in environmental damage and resource depletion. To address this, integrated production systems offer sustainable strategies with numerous benefits including efficient land use, animal welfare promotion, carbon and nitrogen sequestration, improved microclimatic conditions, increased soil organic matter, and reduced erosion. These systems combine agricultural crops, livestock, and forestry, promoting ecological interactions and are common in small farms in developing countries, but can also be implemented in different regions and situations. This article explores evaluations of environmental impacts of integrated production systems, highlighting the ongoing interest in this field through a systematic literature review with the support of the Biblioshiny software as a research method. The literature has revealed barriers in the initial investments of these systems, as well as the need for adequate knowledge and management to ensure efficient integration of activities and scaled-up productions. Overall, future research is necessary to assess underexplored or unexplored categories of environmental impacts and inform effective policies for mitigating negative impacts and promoting positive ones.

AB  - The aviation industry is one of the most rapidly growing transportation sectors, and contributes 2% of anthro-pogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Next decades, sustainable aviation fuels will play a key role in achieving reductions in aviation emissions. This study was aimed at investigating the potential of sustainable aviation fuel production from waste materials such as municipal solid waste, including food waste and waste cooking oils, as well as agricultural and forestry residues using current conversion technologies, based on data from recent literature. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA analysis. Results showed that catalytic hydro -processing of waste lipid feedstocks is the most widely used conversion method for bio-jet fuel production. Moreover, waste plastic catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis with solid biomass residues can contribute to the implementation of effective policy support and improvement of current technologies to reduce production costs. Besides, gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch and alcohol-to-jet processes revealed as interesting pathway for sustainable aviation fuel production. Although solid waste materials are promising alternative feedstocks for the production of biofuel, including aviation-range hydrocarbons, more research and development is required, as most of these advanced technologies have yet to be commercialised.

PESs legitimize environmental goals, policies, budgets, and reports, allowing for environmentally friendly actions and behaviors. In order to highlight measures, antecedents, and outcomes of PESs in the H&T industries, 287 articles were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. Only 78 articles were identified as eligible for the final analysis, spanning a period of more than 26 years (1996 till 2022). The current review demonstrates that PESs in H&T have advanced over the last 26 years. There are many PESs in H&T, with no unified set of measurement tools of PESs. Additionally, there are many antecedents and outcomes of PESs in H&T. However, there has been a paucity of research on H&T PESs, necessitating a thorough investigation of several issues. This review discusses implications and recommendations for H&T and presents a strategy for extending future studies through theoretical advancement and empirical development. The current research is the first to conduct a systematic review of PESs in an H&T context.

AB  - Entrepreneurial teams are dynamic entities that frequently experience the exit of individual team members. Such entrepreneurial team member exits (ETMEs) entail serious consequences for the exiting individual, the remaining team, and the performance of the affected venture. While ETMEs are receiving increasing scholarly attention, the research landscape is still considerably fragmented. This is the first article to take stock, analyze, and discuss this crucial and emerging field of research by providing a systematic review of the literature on ETMEs. We identify central themes comprising of antecedents, routes, consequences, and the contextual embeddedness of ETMEs and integrate them into a comprehensive processual framework. Based on this framework, we contribute to the research on ETMEs by discussing the themes in the light of promising theoretical perspectives, introducing novel ideas, concepts, and approaches to enrich future avenues. Specifically, we propose to expand the concept of team heterogeneity to advance our understanding of antecedents as well as to investigate power relations and negotiation behavior within ETME routes. In addition, we offer ways to resolve the sometimes inconsistent findings in terms of venture consequences and present a fertile approach for a more in-depth cultural contextualization of the phenomenon.

AB  - In this systematic review, I cumulate previous research findings indicating that sustainable urbanism and networked public governance can be instrumental in carrying out extensive sustainability and resilience objectives through steering urban transformations in the direction of sustainability and resilience. Urban analytics data infrastructure, multicriteria sustainability evaluation, and sustainable performance assessment display the intricate network dynamics operational within cities, impacting urban resilience decision-making processes and leading to equitable and sustainable urban development. Throughout July 2020, I conducted a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases, search terms including "sustainable urban planning," "urban sustainability assessment," "sustainable urban governance/urban sustainability governance," "sustainable urban development," "sustainable/sustainability behavior," and "environmental performance." As I focused on research published exclusively in the past two years, only 301 various types of articles met the eligibility criteria. By removing those whose results were inconclusive, unconfirmed by replication, or too general, and because of space constraints, I selected 153, mainly empirical, sources. Future research should investigate whether the assessment of environmental sustainability performance of heterogeneous urban configurations by shared sustainability policymaking through spatial green infrastructure planning and regulations articulate sustainable urban design and governance for the development of innovative performance.

AB  - Forest Management in the Brazilian Amazon has social, economic and environmental relevance, as it allows for the sustainable use of natural resources, while at the same time conserving a majority of the ecological processes of the forest. Among forest operations, the construction of new roads is essential for effective sustainable forest management (SFM). However, it is the most expensive part of forest infrastructure and has the greatest environmental impact. Several methods to optimize forest road planning (FRP) have been studied worldwide, although the literature is scarce on the subject of FRP in areas of SFM in Amazonia. Thus, the objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the global literature, on FRP optimization in the last decade (2009?2019), as a way to support future planning activities for road infrastructure in SFM in the Amazon. To guide this objective, three questions were raised to determine what the dominant factors affecting FRP in the study period, specifically what were the: (i) spatial variables; (ii) spatial decision analysis and; (iii) optimization methods for road layout. The bibliographic search was conducted according to the Prisma methodology where a set of keywords was entered into the Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science indexing databases. In this study, all articles published in English-language journals between 2009 and 2019 were considered, resulting in 62 articles for analysis. There was a growing trend in publications, with most studies developed at the level of strategic planning (46.8%). Also, it was observed that the majority of studies occurred in the forests of Iran (33.9%). The results to the questions of this study found that: (i) there were 45 spatial variables, with slope the most studied (54.7%); (ii) Eleven methods of analysis for spatial decisions, with methods based on Analytical Hierarchy Process ? AHP the most studied (36.6%) and; (iii) Thirty different methodologies for optimizing the design of forest roads, mainly methods based on Dijkstra?s algorithm (40.5%). Some of the encountered methods have already been implemented in Amazonia to optimize the planning of infrastructure in areas of SFM. In this context, the combination of approaches, variables and analysis for FRP optimization that have been successfully tested in other forests of the world, could feasibly be applied in future planning of logging operations in the Amazon in order to verify the potential of these different procedures and methods, provided that they meet the

AB  - Introduction: Iliac venous stenting is an established treatment option for both post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic iliac venous obstructions. Nonetheless, there is still no consensus on the best medical practice regarding some of these interventions. One area of debate is the safety of extending venous stents across the inguinal ligament (IL), with contradictory results from various authors and overall poor-quality research. This review aims to summarise current knowledge on the effect of venous stent placement across the IL on primary patency. Evidence acquisition: A literature search was performed on the MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science databases, which returned 531 studies. Eleven studies were included. Data were extracted using piloted forms, and, if necessary, authors were contacted to obtain further information. Evidence synthesis: Two studies were prospective cohorts, whereas the remaining 9 were retrospective cohorts. Overall study quality was weak. Four studies showed a statistically significant association between stent placement across the IL and decreased primary patency. A multivariate analysis was performed in two of those studies, yet only one maintained statistical significance after multivariate analysis. Two studies reported 4 cases of stent fracture in total, and one study reported 5 cases of stent compression. All cases of stent fracture or compression occurred at the inguinal ligament. Conclusions: Although current expert opinion favors stent placement across the IL, there is still insufficient evidence to recommend for or against venous stenting across the IL. Further research is required on comparing alternatives for the treatment of iliac venous lesions that extend into the common femoral vein. Despite the establishment of venous stenting as a viable treatment option for both post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic iliac venous obstructions, there is an ongoing debate on the safety of extending such stents across the inguinal ligament. There are several publications on this subject, with conflicting results and overall poor-quality research. This is the first systematic review of published clinical evidence on the impact of venous stent placement across the IL on primary patency. (Cite this article as: Machado H, Sousa J, Mansilha A.

AB  - The performance of choice-reaction tasks during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable biomechanics in the lower limb. However, the mechanism of this observation is unknown. We conducted a systematic review examining the association between (1) the biomechanical and functional safety of unplanned sports-related movements (e.g., jumps/runs with a spontaneously indicated landing leg/cutting direction) and (2) markers of perceptual-cognitive function (PCF). A literature search in three databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) identified five relevant articles. The study quality, rated by means of a modified Downs and Black checklist, was moderate to high (average: 13/16 points). Four of five papers, in at least one parameter, found either an association of PCF with task safety or significantly reduced task safety in low vs. high PCF performers. However, as (a) the outcomes, populations and statistical methods of the included trials were highly heterogeneous and (b) only two out of five studies had an adequate control condition (pre-planned movement task), the evidence was classified as conflicting. In summary, PCF may represent a factor affecting injury risk and performance during unplanned sports-related movements, but future research strengthening the evidence for this association is warranted.

AB  - Marine megafauna serve valuable ecological and economical roles globally, yet, many species have experienced precipitous population declines. The significance of marine megafauna is particularly evident in Macaronesia, a complex of oceanic archipelagos in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Macaronesian islands provide important habitats for marine megafauna species, in turn supporting considerable regional economic activity (e.g., ecotourism and fisheries). Despite this, concerted efforts to manage marine megafauna throughout Macaronesia have been limited. This systematic review provides the first description of the trends in marine megafauna research in this unique insular ecosystem, to provide a better understanding of taxa-specific research needs and future directions for conservation. We identified and validated 408 peer-reviewed publications until 2021 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Literature was dominated by marine mammal research conducted in the northern archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands) and marine turtle research conducted in Cabo Verde. Much less research focused on large-bodied fish, especially in Madeira and Canary Islands, leaving some of the most vulnerable species regionally data deficient. Research across scientific disciplines focused more on biological studies than management and policy, and anthropogenic impacts were quantified more frequently on mammals or turtles and less on fishes. By identifying gaps in our knowledge of megafauna in relation to threats faced by these organisms, we offer taxa-specific recommendations for future research direction. Although, overall our results indicate that determining population level connectivity should be a major research priority among many marine megafauna species as this information is vital to numerous management strategies, including marine protected areas. In this review, we present a basis of understanding of the current work in Macaronesia, highlighting critical data gaps that are urgently needed to guide the next steps toward establishing conservation priorities for marine megafauna in the region.

AB  - A systematic literature review is conducted to investigate the environmental impact of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. Due to the focus of recent research on Bitcoin, an inductive approach has been applied to analyze and cluster the findings of PoW cryptocurrencies into seven aspects that effect the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies: resources, energy consumption, carbon footprint, environmental-related social and economic aspects, policy regulation and subsidization, and electronic waste. Subsequently, interconnections and rebound effects are presented and discussed by synthesizing results from each of the seven aspects into one scenario analysis inspired by the crackdown on cryptocurrency miners in China, 2021. Furthermore, it was observed that proposed policy regulation in literature is strongly focusing on miners. As the profitability of miners globally depends on the price of the PoW cryptocurrency, researchers and policymakers are advised to focus more on investors and third-party services such as regulated exchanges. Thus, identifying and implementing policies that demotivate investment in PoW cryptocurrencies could reduce their prices and the incentive to mine. Ultimately, it was assessed that PoW cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are historically associated with an ever-increasing environmental impact. In contrary, researchers address PoS as a sustainable alternative that poses a solution to the environmental issues related to PoW.

AB  - In this article, we present results from a literature review of intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values of nature conducted for the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as part of the Methodological Assessment of the Diverse Values and Valuations of Nature. We identify the most frequently recurring meanings in the heterogeneous use of different value types and their association with worldviews and other key concepts. From frequent uses, we determine a core meaning for each value type, which is sufficiently inclusive to serve as an umbrella over different understandings in the literature and specific enough to help highlight its difference from the other types of values. Finally, we discuss convergences, overlapping areas, and fuzzy boundaries between different value types to facilitate dialogue, reduce misunderstandings, and improve the methods for valuation of nature's contributions to people, including ecosystem services, to inform policy and direct future research.

AB  - Introduction: The application of remote-sensing techniques for water quality assessment has become increasingly popular in China. However, existing reviews are often limited to qualitative description and are quite fragmented. Outcomes: We conducted a quantitative systematic review to display current research status and identify the existing challenges and future directions. Our review revealed that the application of remote-sensing techniques in water quality research has expanded dramatically in China, but the spatial distribution is quite uneven. Second, the ground object spectrometer is the most widely applied data source. Water color indicators such as chlorophyll a and suspended solid are the most widely investigated in China. Third, semiempirical method is the most commonly used inversion method. Existing studies rarely considered the anthropogenic factors, which limited the model robustness and its application in human-dominated aquatic ecosystems. Discussion and Conclusion: We concluded that, in the past several decades, China has made notable progresses in monitoring and evaluation of water quality using the remote-sensing techniques (especially in inland lakes). We proposed that further improvements would be needed in terms of temporal and spatial coverage, indicator list, the incorporation of human-nature interactions, inversion accuracy, and model generalization.

AB  - Combined, decentralized systems for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse may enhance the water security of urban areas by reducing dependence on the main water supply, in particular during critical periods, such as the dry season. They can also minimize the risk of flooding during the rainy season. The present study assesses the accumulated knowledge of these combined systems based on a systematic review of the literature restricted to academic sources. The review revealed knowledge gaps that must be resolved to better assess the optimum combination of rainwater and greywater recovery, how this affects the need for the treatment of the recovered water, its final quality, potential options for reuse, water economy, and the environmental and economic performance of the system. Further empirical studies are required to determine the most adequate design configuration for these systems, considering their multiple objectives, technological perspectives, and in particular, their potential for improving environmental shortcomings. There is a clear need for widespread use of low-impact technologies to ensure the most effective possible results. Water recovery systems will become increasingly important as a means of tackling the challenges of water supplies in the urban landscape, which are being exacerbated by climate change.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to summarize and analyze what is known regarding the ways in which stakeholder pressure may influence supply chain sustainability. The authors extend this understanding to develop a number of research questions and propositions for future investigation on this topic.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a systematic review process to study the empirical evidence pertaining to how a stakeholder perspective helps to understand sustainability in the supply chain management domain.
   Findings - The review has three main findings: stakeholder pressure on sustainability in supply chain management may result in sustainability awareness, adoption of sustainability goals, and/or implementation of sustainability practices; different types of stakeholders have dissimilar influence in the sustainable supply chain decision areas; different stakeholders appears to be more or less influential depending on whether the sustainability issue is environmental or social.
   Originality/value - This synthesis contributes to the literature by developing insight into the processes by which stakeholder pressure influences SSCM decisions.

AB  - A smart city presupposes an innovative society that connects technologies to people, contributing to the development of cities. It implies an approach in which knowledge works as a strategic tool to design efficient and sustainable supply of goods and services to the community. Based on systematic literature review, this research's objective was to analyze the role of innovation in the sustainable development of smart cities and discuss the research gaps and trends on the topic. The analyzed documents were evaluated in terms of the number of annual publications, the regional mapping of publications, and areas of interest. A relationship network was drawn up with the keywords established by the authors in order to identify research trends and opportunities. Even though we are dealing with a recent topic, the systematic review showed that there are significant important approaches in the field of sustainability, but still little explored, as in the case of studies focused on smart health and governance of urban centers. On the other hand, studies related to the use of "big data" and sustainable development for cities stand out, indicating a possible trend in the scientific area. The increase of scientific interest in the topic was noticed in the analysis, not only because of the growing number of publications, but also because of the varied new research approaching subjects not yet explored.

AB  - The concept of local climate zones (LCZ) has emerged to identify the nature of urban climate, air quality, and temperature at local levels. Thus, this study reviews the literature on methodologies and data sources used in LCZs empirical research and identifies recurrent themes. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework. Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to extract relevant datasets, and records were screened and extracted. Descriptive analyses reveal that most LCZ empirical research has been done on Chinese cities. Numerous data sources and analytical methods have been used, but Landsat and WUDAPT methodology is generally favored in the LCZ research due to its simplicity and freely available global datasets. Similarly, the review also shows that various software and methodologies are available to identify climate-sensitive areas of urban settlements with varying functionalities, accuracy, and visualizations. The thematic analysis indicates that the LCZ framework and its associated processes are being used in crosscutting phenomena such as thermal comfort, urban planning, climate change adaptation, and energy use. The review also suggests incorporating institutional and social aspects in local climate zones. LCZs can integrate the philosophies of climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and sustainability.

AB  - Chemicals, essential materials for modern life, emit substantial greenhouse gases during production and use. Like the other carbon-intensive industries, the chemical industry is a complex and diverse industry to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonizing the chemical industry is critical to overcoming the climate crisis and building a sustainable and vibrant future. We conducted a comprehensive and systematic review screening more than 5.6 million articles and thoroughly analyzing a shortlist of 246 studies about the decarbonization in-novations of the chemical industry. Based on the review results, we identified the sociotechnical system of the industry into four groups: raw materials, chemical making processes, chemical product making and usage, and waste management and recycling. Our review also assesses the opportunities, challenges, current and emerging practices, and 71 potentially transformative technologies for the decarbonization of the chemical industry. The decarbonization innovations for the industry create environmental, financial, and collateral benefits. Still, there are also barriers across economic, technical, political, and behavioral aspects to decarbonization. To overcome those barriers, the review suggests policy and social instruments. We lastly outlined research gaps and future agendas for the chemical industry's decarbonization.

AB  - Background: Active transport has numerous environmental and health benefits. However, these benefits are not evenly distributed across the population because its utilization is strongly linked to a person's socioeconomic and cultural factors. Through the lens of intersectionality, this systematic review analyzed how gender and its interactions with other socioeconomic and cultural factors influence a person's decision to utilize active transport in urban settings.Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the authors screened 1,993 titles and abstracts that were published between January 2000 and December 2021. Twenty-one articles were included for data extraction and synthesis.Results: A person's decision to walk or cycle is highly contextual. In general, women with lower socioeconomic status tend to walk more out of necessity. Women with higher socioeconomic status, higher education level, more free time, and access to safe and convenient infrastructure tend to cycle more. Gendered social and cultural factors might also deter some women from active transport. The following recommendations may attract more people to walk or cycle for transportation: developing community-based programs that empower girls and women to cycle; building a safe environment that protects all vulnerable road users; creating media and social marketing campaigns that shift the cultural narratives around active transport; designing neighourhoods with higher mixed land usage; and advocating for gender and income equality.

AB  - Behavioral parent training is an evidence-based intervention that reduces child problem behavior. Unfortunately, there are notable disparities in access to and use of evidence-based parenting interventions, including BPT. One way to address the service gap is through technology-based parenting interventions. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the populations targeted in technology-based parenting interventions, the effectiveness of these interventions, and areas and populations where future research is warranted. A search of three databases yielded 31 articles that met inclusion criteria. We included articles if they (a) were treatment outcome studies using web-based interventions or (b) discussed methodologies or models pertaining to web-based interventions, (c) specified demographic information such as race, ethnicity, and SES, and (d) were published in English or Spanish. We coded 25 treatment outcome studies and six feasibility studies. Technology-based parenting interventions have successfully improved parenting variables such as parent knowledge, behavior, and self-efficacy. Yet the vast majority of these interventions are validated with White American families and lack adaptations that may make them more accessible to underserved populations. As the burgeoning area of technology-based interventions continues to grow, researchers should consider underserved populations and appropriate cultural adaptations that could reduce mental health disparities and increase the scope of evidence-based interventions.

AB  - The Amazonia is suffering consequences due to deforestation, since it is located on the considered path of the advance of the Deforestation Arc, becoming one of the regions that most stands out in deforested areas in Brazil, since it presents vast alterations in natural landscapes due to the agricultural expansion. This work aimed to carry out a systematic bibliographical review on the importance in the production of seedlings that provide forest essences for the Amazon. The bibliographic research was carried out in the following electronic databases: Periodicals Capes, SciELO and Academic Google. It was used as inclusion criterion: original articles and review article, published in international and national periodicals, in the period of the last 10 years. The total of 20 articles were found and from the analysis, the articles were categorized into: Amazon Region, deforestation, production of forest seedlings in the Amazon and reforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, 15 plant species showed potential for the production of seedlings of forest essences. The practice of deforestation causes major environmental impacts on the Amazon ecosystem and the ecosystems that are directly influenced by it. Therefore, the Amazon region has great ecosystemic importance, as it presents great diversity of species. The result of this research will help new works that can mitigate the effects of the practice of deforestation.

AB  - Introduction As atopic dermatitis (AD) grows increasingly prevalent in Asian populations worldwide, understanding how environmental, genetic, and cultural factors uniquely influence AD in Asians is essential for informing disease management. Our objectives were to characterize the epidemiology of AD in East Asian populations with sensitivity to the changing demographics of AD in these populations and the effects of urbanization and immigration. Methods A systematic review was performed on epidemiologic studies of AD in East Asian populations over the past 10 years. Results There is a rising prevalence of both pediatric and adult AD in Asian populations worldwide, particularly in Asians living in urban areas. Studies suggest that the children of Asian immigrants may be at higher risk for developing AD, potentially resulting from epigenetic phenomena unique to immigrant populations. A number of genetic polymorphisms implicated in AD are shared by Asian populations around the world and appear to be rare among other ethnic populations. Conclusions As the prevalence of AD continues to increase in Asian populations, it is important to understand its distinct genetic and pathophysiologic profile in these populations, as well as characterize the cultural beliefs and practices surrounding its treatment. Future research should aim to capitalize on our growing understanding of pathophysiologic differences to inform the most promising treatments for AD in Asians. Additionally, the impact of immigration on AD suggests that further investigation of these trends may lead to a greater understanding of the epigenetics of AD.

AB  - Oily sludge is a hazardous material generated from the petroleum industry that has attracted increasing research interest. Although several review articles have dealt with specific subtopics focusing on the treatment of oily sludge based on selected references, no attempt has been made to demonstrate the research trend of oily sludge comprehensively and quantitatively. This study conducted a systematic review to analyze and evaluate all oily sludge-related journal articles retrieved from the Web of Science database. The results show that an increase in oily sludge-related research did not take place until recent years and the distribution of the researchers is geographically out of balance. Most oily sludge-related articles focused on treatment for harmfulness reduction or valorization with limited coverage of formation, characterization, and environmental impact assessment of oily sludge. Pyrolytic treatment has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. So far, the research findings have been largely based on laboratory-scale experiments with insufficient consideration of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed treatment methods. Although many methods have been proposed, few alone could satisfactorily achieve cost-effective treatment goals. To enable sustainable management of oily sludge on a global scale, efforts need to be made to fund more research projects, especially in the major oil-producing countries. Pilot-scale experiments using readily available and affordable materials should be encouraged for practical purposes. This will allow a sensible cost-benefit analysis of a proposed method/procedure for oily sludge treatment. To improve the treatment performance, combined methods are more desirable. To inform the smart selection of methods for the treatment of different oily sludge types, it is suggested to develop universally accepted evaluation systems for characterization and environmental risk of oily sludge.

AB  - The main outcome of sustainable agro-food systems is food and nutrition security. Nevertheless, about half of the global population is affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, asymptom of the dysfunctions of the current food system. This paper provides a review of the state of research on the sustainability ofagro-food transitions, and the extent to which and in what ways such research examines food and nutrition security. A search carried out on Scopus in January 2018 yielded 771 documents; 120 of these were included in the systematic review. Agro-food represents a small share of the sustainability transitions research field. Most of the available research focuses on crops and the production stage. In general, it is assumed that a transition to sustainability in the agro-food arena would lead to increased food availability, improved food access, better food utilisation and increased food system stability and resilience. However, scholars also point out that the quest for food security (especially through intensification) may undermine transition towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. Likewise, it is assumed that a transition towards sustainable food systems implies changes in dietary patterns and nutrition habits. Nevertheless, food security and nutrition are still marginal topics in the literature on agro-food sustainability transitions. Furthermore, transformation of food systems, which should guide agro-food sustainability transitions, is the exception rather than the rule in the research field. This systematic review represents a useful contribution to research on transitions towards sustainability in agriculture and food sectors, and provides insights into how such research can contribute to addressing the grand challenges of food insecurity and malnutrition. The paper suggests the need to move beyond silos by fostering cross-sectoral collaboration and the integration of the agro-food sustainability transitions and food security research fields.

AB  - This study uses a systematic review in examining the factors that may have a negative impact on social enterprises in Indonesia within an institutional framework. An institutional framework was used in this study to update existing studies. Moreover, this study is also intended to explore the obstacles that may exist in improving the performance of social entrepreneurs in Indonesia. A systematic review of the literature is the approach used in this analysis. A researcher can draw plausible observations and present generalizable research by carrying out a comprehensive literature analysis, which is found by predefined literature search techniques. This study was carried out in two stages to complement the systematic analysis, as described below. Eighteen references were found using the literature review criteria and used in the qualitative synthesis. The idea of social entrepreneurship was introduced by the Indonesian government in 2015. Social entrepreneurship has been impacted by the global downturn, political instability, government bureaucracy, and society. Building a solid regulatory system for social enterprise would aid in the success of these businesses. The Indonesian government should provide an awareness center as well as give recommendations to assist the community in navigating the complex cultural landscape. The significance of this study is that it has the potential to affect policy decisions in order to change the structural climate for social entrepreneurship. International investors who want to start a social enterprise in Indonesia can also learn about the institutional structure and how it affects their venture.

AB  - The present systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sport management relevant knowledge, competencies, and skills analyzing and harmonizing the European skills classification for sport management employment profiles and evidence-based information from the scientific literature in this field. The information search in the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations platform resulted in four main sport management professional profiles, whereas literature searches in SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost), Scopus, and Google Scholar databases resulted in 48 manuscripts meeting the inclusion criteria. The main findings showed a substantial scholars' interest in deepening the understanding of necessary sport management-related knowledge/competencies/skills from different research perspectives. However, a disconnect between industry demands and students and/or employees' preparedness and performance emerged, which substantiates the need to systematically update education and training in the sector to foster the sustainable development of this scientific area. Furthermore, in recognizing the centrality of the background, foundational, sport management-related knowledge, the crucial role of competencies and soft skills emerged. The present study not only provided a comprehensive, evidence-based, overview on sport management relevant knowledge/competencies/skills but also proposed a harmonized framework grounded on different relevant clusters that should be considered in developing and implementing educational sustainable programs for sport managers and leaders.

AB  - Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is an environmental policy introduced in Europe, back in the 1990s. Under EPR, a producer's responsibility for its products is extended beyond the consumption stage, and the producer has to meet the targets of collection and recycling rates imposed by the EPR legislation. Motivated by the importance of this topic, in this paper, we conduct a systematic review on EPR from an operations management perspective. To be specific, we categorize the EPR literature, for both e-wastes and non-e-wastes, by research methodologies (qualitative case studies, quantitative empirical research, and analytical modeling studies) and discuss the respective findings. In addition to systematically exploring the state-of-the-art research within the context of EPR, we investigate pertinent issues, such as the implementation of EPR, EPR management systems, supply chain management under EPR, and EPR-related operations (such as end-of-life product management and design for recyclability). We highlight some EPR-related innovative measures and proposals in five areas, namely policy, product, process, supply chain, and technology. Finally, we discuss future research and propose a concluding picture of how EPR can help establish innovative operational measures to improve sustainability

AB  - Waste segregation at the source is one of the most important strategies of urban waste management and the first environmental priority. This systematic review study was conducted to determine the effects of various interventions to promote household waste segregation behavior. Studies were searched in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases using the keywords "waste segregation, intervention, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials". Through 2 January 2022, two researchers were independently involved in article screening and data abstraction. Inclusion criteria were as follows: experimental and quasi-experimental studies where primary outcomes of the studies included improvement in waste separation behavior, and secondary outcomes of the studies included increased knowledge and improvement in psychological factors. Articles that did not focus on households, studies that focused only on food or electronics separation, and studies that focused only on recycling and its methods were excluded. Of the original 5084 studies, only 26 met the inclusion criteria after reviewing the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the articles. The age of study participants ranged from 15 to 82 years. It seems that most of the studies that suggest higher efficacy consider older age groups for the intervention. Positive results of the interventions were reported in all studies with different ratios; in five studies, the improvement in results was more than 20%. Meta-analysis was not possible because of the diversity of study strategies and outcomes measured. In the studies that lasted longer than two months, people's waste separation behavior was more permanent. Approaches such as engagement, feedback, and theory-based interventions have been effective in promoting waste separation behavior. Interventions that considered environmental, social, and organizational factors (such as segregation facilities, regular collection of segregated waste, tax exemption, and cooperation of related organizations) in addition to individual factors were more effective and sustainable. For the comparison of studies and meta-analysis of data, it is suggested to use standard criteria such as mean and standard deviation of waste separation behavior and influential structures such as attitude and norm in studies. The results show that it is necessary to use environmental research and ecological approaches and intermittent interventions over time to maintain and continue waste separation behavior. Based on the results of the current research, policy makers and researchers can develop efficient measures to improve waste sorting behavior by using appropriate patterns in society and knowing the effective factors.

AB  - The increase of greenhouse gases (GHG) generated by the burning of fossil fuels has been recognized as one of the main causes of climate change (CC). Different countries of the world have developed new policies on national energy security directed to the use of renewable energies mainly, ocean energy being one of them. The implementation of ocean energy is increasing worldwide. However, the use of these technologies is not exempt from the generation of potential environmental impacts throughout their life cycle. In this context, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a holistic approach used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or system throughout its entire life cycle. LCA studies need to be conducted to foster the development of ocean energy technologies (OET) in sustainable management. In this paper, a systematic review was conducted and 18 LCA studies of OET were analyzed. Most of the LCA studies are focused on wave and tidal energy. CC is the most relevant impact category evaluated, which is generated mostly by raw material extraction, manufacturing stage and shipping operations. Finally, the critical stages of the systems evaluated were identified, together with, the opportunity areas to promote an environmental management for ocean energy developers.

AB  - Trait-based approaches elucidate the mechanisms underlying biodiversity response to, or effects on, the environment. Nevertheless, the Raunki AE ran shortfall-the dearth of knowledge on species traits and their functionality-presents a challenge in the application of these approaches. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the trends and gaps in trait-based animal ecology in terms of taxonomic resolution, trait selection, ecosystem type, and geographical region. In addition, we suggest a set of crucial steps to guide trait selection and aid future research to conduct within and cross-taxon comparisons. We identified 1655 articles using virtually all animal groups published from 1999 to 2020. Studies were concentrated in vertebrates, terrestrial habitats, the Palearctic realm, and mostly investigated trophic and habitat dimensions. Additionally, they focused on response traits (79.4%) and largely ignored intraspecific variation (94.6%). Almost 36% of the data sets did not provide the rationale behind the selection of morphological traits. The main limitations of trait-based animal ecology were the use of trait averages and a rare inclusion of intraspecific variability. Nearly one-fifth of the studies based only on response traits conclude that trait diversity impacts ecosystem processes or services without justifying the connection between them or measuring them. We propose a guide for standardizing trait collection that includes the following: (i) determining the type of trait and the mechanism linking the trait to the environment, ecosystem, or the correlation between the environment, trait, and ecosystem, (ii) using a "periodic table of niches" to select the appropriate niche dimension to support a mechanistic trait selection, and (iii) selecting the relevant traits for each retained niche dimension. By addressing these gaps, trait-based animal ecology can become more predictive. This implies that future research will likely focus on collaborating to understand how environmental changes impact animals and their capacity to provide ecosystem services and goods.

AB  - School-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports (SWPBIS) is an effective and widely adopted school-wide framework for promoting positive behavioral, social, and academic outcomes for students. However, over the past decade, the degree to which schools were able to implement specific SWPBIS practices with fidelity has emerged as a critical issue, with varying levels of SWPBIS abandonment reported in the literature. Authors have used the term facilitators to describe specific variables that appear to support the sustained implementation of SWPBIS, and the term barriers to describe specific variables that appear to hinder the sustained implementation of SWPBIS (Kincaid et al., 2007). The purpose of the present review was to identify, summarize, and appraise the extant literature on variables reported to function as facilitators and barriers to the sustained implementation of SWPBIS. We identified 22 unique variables that may function as facilitators or barriers. The provision of resources, high fidelity of implementation, and effective SWPBIS team function were the most commonly described facilitators, whereas a conflict in personal beliefs, an ineffective SWPBIS team, and a lack of resources were the most commonly identified barriers. The implications of these findings, along with areas for future research, are discussed.

AB  - Road transport is one of the main contributors to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, consequently aggravating global warming, but it is also one of the sectors that most suffer from climate change, which causes extreme weather events. Thus, strategies, also called adaptation measures, have been discussed to minimize the impacts of climate change on transport systems and their infrastructure; however, a knowledge gap is evident in the literature. Therefore, this article develops a systematic review with a bibliometric approach, still scarce in the literature, in renowned databases, focusing on studies developed on adaptation measures for road infrastructure. The results show that, since the development of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an increasing amount of studies on the theme have been published in recognized journals such as Science of the Total Environment, Energy and Buildings and Urban Climate, analyzing climate threats such as intense precipitations and high temperatures that have led to biophysical impacts such as flooding and urban heat island. In addition, for each type of adverse weather condition, many impacts on road infrastructure can be listed, as well as ways to detect these impacts, and adaptation measures that can be used to minimize these problems.

AB  - Background: Bleach baths have been proposed as a treatment for decreasing the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, conflicting results have been found regarding their efficacy.
   Objective: To determine the efficacy of bleach vs water baths at decreasing AD severity.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of all studies evaluating the efficacy of bleach baths for AD. Cochrane, EMBASE, GREAT, LILACS, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched. Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction.
   Results: Five studies were included in the review. Four studies reported significantly decreased AD severity in patients treated with bleach on at least 1 time point. However, of 4 studies comparing bleach with water baths, only 2 found significantly greater decreases in AD severity with bleach baths, 1 found greater decreases with water baths, and 1 found no significant differences. In pooled analyses, there were no significant differences observed between bleach vs water baths at 4 weeks vs baseline for the Eczema Area and Severity Index (I-2 = 98%; random effect regression model, P = .16) or body surface area (I-2 = 96%; P = .36).
   Conclusion: Although bleach baths are effective in decreasing AD severity, they do not appear to be more effective than water baths alone. Future larger-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. (C) 2017 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological restoration has become an overarching management paradigm for sustaining the health and resilience of forests across western North America. Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales ( < 25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts ( > 75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term ( < 25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire. Ecological restoration in forests across the western US has to carefully balance the budget of ecosystem carbon with competing objectives such as improved wildlife habitat, reduced risk of severe wildfire, and other ecosystem services.

AB  - Delivering vaccines in humanitarian response requires rigourous and continuous analysis of evidence. This systematic review mapped the normative landscape of vaccination guidance on vaccine-preventable diseases in crisis-affected settings. Guidance published between 2000 and 2022 was searched for, in English and French, on websites of humanitarian actors, Google, and Bing. Peer-reviewed database searches were performed in Global Health and Embase. Reference lists of all included documents were screened. We disseminated an online survey to professionals working in vaccination delivery in humanitarian contexts. There was a total of 48 eligible guidance documents, including technical guidance (n = 17), descriptive guidance (n = 16), operational guidance (n = 11), evidence reviews (n = 3), and ethical guidance (n = 1). Most were World Health Organization documents (n = 21) targeting children under 5 years of age. Critical appraisal revealed insufficient inclusion of affected populations and limited rigour in guideline development. We found limited information on vaccines including, yellow fever, cholera, meningococcal, hepatitis A, and varicella, as well as human papilloma virus (HPV). There is a plethora of vaccination guidance for vaccine-preventable diseases in humanitarian contexts. However, gaps remain in the critical and systematic inclusion of evidence, inclusion of the concept of "zero-dose" children and affected populations, ethical guidance, and specific recommendations for HPV and non-universally recommended vaccines, which must be addressed.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to present the evolution of decent work studies. Findings point to several directions for future research efforts, including conceptualizing decent work and the pandemic's associated impact. Results will help to guide government authorities to promote decent work by delivering fair income, increasing the stability and security of employment and monitoring employees' work-life balance.Design/methodology/approachThis review consists of knowledge mapping based on keywords from multidisciplinary studies on decent work and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model on tourism and hospitality studies. First, keyword knowledge mapping was conducted in VOSviewer, resulting in 667 papers. Then, a PRISMA model generated a systematic review of the literature in tourism and hospitality based on 41 papers.FindingsKnowledge mapping revealed six thematic clusters, namely, Labor Rights and Gender Equality, Sustainability and Health, Psychology of Working Theory, Conceptualization of Decent Work, Marginalized Groups and Unemployment and Job Quality. According to the PRISMA model, the conceptual evolution of decent work in tourism and hospitality can be divided into three stages: initial (1999-2008), emerging (2009-2018) and development (2019-present).Research limitations/implicationsBased on the findings, further interdisciplinary research into decent work is recommended. Scholars in the tourism and hospitality sector can incorporate other fields of decent work, such as psychology, to broaden the lens of studies to discover the role of meaning and purpose in the workplace and to promote the concept to its fullest extent. Furthermore, employees' assessments of decent work might help businesses improve human resources management via corporate social responsibility measures.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first systematic review of decent work in tourism and hospitality. It shows that this notion is in its infancy, as most studies on the topic thus far have been empirical and descriptive. Nonetheless, most findings contribute to knowledge and practice by clarifying industry employment conditions.

Herbal crude extracts are used in traditional medicine as a treatment for wounds and other illnesses. However, the progress in the use of plants has been deterred due to their poor solubility and poor bioavailability requiring administration at high doses. It has been established that nanoencapsulation of herbal products in nanocarriers (size 1 nm to 100 nm) such as nanofibers, nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanoliposomes greatly improves their efficacy. Due to their small and large surface area, nanocarriers are more biologically active, improve bioavailability, protect the drug from deterioration, and release it to the targeted site in a sustainable manner.AimThe review aims to collate and appraise evidence on the efficacy of nano encapsulated herbal extracts in the treatment of induced wounds in animal models.MethodsThe review will be protocol-driven and conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis for Protocols (PRISMA-P) and protocol guidelines for systematic review and meta-analysis for animal intervention studies. The final review will be conducted and reported with reference to PRISMA 2020 statement. Studies will be searched in Pub Med, ProQuest, Web of Science, Medline Ovid, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The PRISMA flow criteria will be followed in screening the articles for inclusion. Data extraction form will be designed in Excel spreadsheet 2013 and data extracted based on the primary and secondary outcomes. Risk of bias assessment will be done using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Data analysis will be done using narrative and quantitative synthesis.Expected resultsWe hope to make meaningful comparisons between the effectiveness of the herb-loaded nanomaterials and other interventions (controls) in the selected studies, based on the primary and secondary outcome measures. We expect that these findings to inform clinical practice on whether preclinical studies show enough quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of herbal-loaded nanomaterials that can be translated into clinical trials and further research.Systemic review registrationPROSPERO 330330.

AB  - Urban transportation is an important determinant of health and environmental outcomes, and therefore essential to achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. To better understand the health impacts of transportation initiatives, we conducted a systematic review of longitudinal health evaluations involving: a) bus rapid transit (BRT); b) bicycle lanes; c) Open Streets programs; and d) aerial trams/cable cars. We also synthesized systems-based simulation studies of the health-related consequences of walking, bicycling, aerial tram, bus and BRT use.
   Two reviewers screened 3302 unique titles and abstracts identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, TRID and LILACS databases. We included 39 studies: 29 longitudinal evaluations and 10 simulation studies. Five studies focused on low- and middle-income contexts. Of the 29 evaluation studies, 19 focused on single component bicycle lane interventions; the rest evaluated multi-component interventions involving: bicycle lanes (n = 5), aerial trams (n = 1), and combined bicycle lane/BRT systems (n = 4). Bicycle lanes and BRT systems appeared effective at increasing bicycle and BRT mode share, active transport duration, and number of trips using these modes. Of the 10 simulation studies, there were 9 agent-based models and one system dynamics model. Five studies focused on bus/BRT expansions and incentives, three on interventions for active travel, and the rest investigated combinations of public transport and active travel policies. Synergistic effects were observed when multiple policies were implemented, with several studies showing that sizable interventions are required to significantly shift travel mode choices.
   Our review indicates that bicycle lanes and BRT systems represent promising initiatives for promoting population health. There is also evidence to suggest that synergistic effects might be achieved through the combined implementation of multiple transportation policies. However, more rigorous evaluation and simulation studies focusing on low- and middle-income countries, aerial trams and Open Streets programs, and a more diverse set of health and health equity outcomes is required.

AB  - Marine mammals, due to their long life span, key position in the food web, and large lipid deposits, often face significant health risks from accumulating contaminants. This systematic review examines published literature on pollutant-induced adverse health effects in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red listed marine mammal species. Thereby, identifying gaps in literature across different extinction risk categories, spatial distribution and climatic zones of studied habitats, commonly used methodologies, researched pollutants, and mechanisms from cellular to population levels. Our findings reveal a lower availability of exposure-effect data for higher extinction risk species (critically endangered 16%, endangered 15%, vulnerable 66%), highlighting the need for more research. For many threatened species in the Southern Hemisphere pollutant-effect relationships are not established. Non-destructively sampled tissues, like blood or skin, are commonly measured for exposure assessment. The most studied pollutants are POPs (31%), metals (30%), and pesticides (17%). Research on mixture toxicity is scarce while pollution-effect studies primarily focus on molecular and cellular levels. Bridging the gap between molecular data and higher-level effects is crucial, with computational approaches offering a high potential through in vitro to in vivo extrapolation using (toxico-)kinetic modelling. This could aid in population-level risk assessment for threatened marine mammals.

AB  - Five to seven in every 10 people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are youths. They have significantly low employment rates but are unattracted to agriculture. Recently, the sector has witnessed considerable efforts by African governments to promote youth participation. While these efforts have started to bear fruits, salient gender issues remain hard to address and solve promptly. For example, youth empowerment issues-whether mutual or emancipative, asset ownership, taboos and cultural expectations, perceptions against climate change, and use of technology and ICT significantly influence livestock production among pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. While these problems are partly known and being solved, it is to be understood the extent and the salient gender issues that drive youth participation in livestock production. To understand this, we conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to thematically synthesize and evidence the youth-empowering interventions in livestock production systems in Sub-Sahara Africa. Peer-reviewed studies were retrieved from online databases (Scopus, Google Scholar (TM), and gray literature). The findings show that youth face significant barriers to participating in livestock systems ranging from limited empowerment, limited access to productive assets and land, social-cultural limitations and inadequate youth-focused policy implementation. Despite the hurdles, youths, and other actors are employing various mechanisms to overcome them and enhance their participation in livestock systems. They utilize self-driven approaches such as gifting animals amongst themselves, forming saving groups commonly referred to as merry-go-rounds and belonging to community group formations as a form of social capital to empower themselves mutually. Education is also an empowerment tool for youths in the livestock sector. Emancipative empowerment through participation in political and community-level leadership is taking shape, though still in its infancy. There are opportunities presented by small ruminants and poultry where women and youths are getting a voice in the community by becoming relatively income independent and desisting from waiting for the inheritance of large livestock and assets from men. Opportunities presented by ICT in the field of livestock have been taken advantage of through the use of various apps and internet tools to enhance youth participation in livestock systems.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - BackgroundCoastal areas in Guinea-Bissau and elsewhere in West Africa are bordered by mangrove forests. In several of these places, swaths of mangrove forest have been removed and the landscape has been technologically adapted for the production of mangrove rice-a regionally important staple. However, the effects of global warming, in particular sea-level rise, pose challenges to these socioecological environments. In this context, knowledge appears as an important resource and knowing what knowledge has been produced and which perspectives have guided that production may inform future responses to climate change. We have developed a systematic literature review protocol focusing on the main question: "How have mangrove forest and mangrove rice spaces been represented in the literature on Guinea-Bissau?" The main hypothesis is that although they occupy contiguous, interrelated and interactant spaces in coastal environments, mangrove forests and mangrove rice have been studied and analyzed independently in the literature. MethodsThis is a protocol for conducting a systematic review that will include academic and non-academic literature in Portuguese, English and French. The academic literature will be retrieved from both Web of Science and Scopus using Boolean expressions. The non-academic literature will be accessed from relevant institutions, specialized libraries, and reference lists of previously selected items. Data extraction will follow a standard procedure based on an information sheet. Our analysis will be both qualitative (inductive and deductive coding, content analysis) and quantitative (word clouds, descriptive statistics and statistical testing). DiscussionThis systematic review will provide information about the conceptual framework that has been produced through research, policymaking, and conservation and development programs in the management of coastal areas. This study will identify the limitations of previous approaches and contribute to both future research and strategies for planning adaptation to climate change. Finally, the outputs will add to broader debates about people-nature coexistence and climate change adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - Reliability of scientific findings is important, especially if they directly impact decision making, such as in environmental management. In the 1990s, assessments of reliability in the medical field resulted in the development of evidence-based practice. Ten years later, evidence-based practice was translated into conservation, but so far no guidelines exist on how to assess the evidence of individual studies. Assessing the evidence of individual studies is essential to appropriately identify and synthesize the confidence in research findings. We develop a tool to assess the strength of evidence of ecosystem services and conservation studies. This tool consists of (1) a hierarchy of evidence, based on the experimental design of studies and (2) a critical-appraisal checklist that identifies the quality of research implementation. The application is illustrated with 13 examples and we suggest further steps to move towards more evidence-based environmental management.

AB  - Climate change is impacting food and beverage crops around the world with implications for environmental and human well-being. While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identi fi ed 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, speci fi c environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or fi rst tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method associated with a bibliometric analysis on global perspective of technological advances in waste-to-energy (WTE). OpenRefine and VOSviewer software supported the bibliometric analysis. It was possible to establish the scientific gap through the correlation among interactions observed on co-authored countries' analyses, cited sources of co-citation, cited authors of co-citation, and keyword of the co-occurrence author. A total of 10 papers were included for meta-analysis and categorized into 8 fields: author(s), title, published year, research areas, energy conversion technologies, wastes used for energy production, WTE products, key findings. Considering the end use of the products, the systematic literature review confirmed a limitation of research focusing on the opportunities for a cleaner transport sector. When analysing the author's keywords, the most cited were 'municipal solid waste', 'incineration', 'waste management', 'gasification', 'anaerobic digestion', 'combustion', 'waste-to-energy', 'landfill gas', and 'sustainability', noting that the studies were directed at economic and sustainable development, as well as circular economy, aiming to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. As can be seen from the systematic review associated with the bibliometric analysis presented, the waste to energy technology is an important innovation way or route that finds numerous applications in the transport and energetic sector. It was evidenced that the WTE research efforts are mainly focused on the conversion of waste for end use electricity generation. The main role of WTE technologies in the circular economy is the energy recovery from biomass and non-recyclable waste, and also it was presented as a viable alternative to the decarbonization of transport and energy sectors.

AB  - Objective: As environmental and economic pressures converge with demands to achieve sustainability development goals, low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) increasingly require strategies to strengthen and scale-up evidence-based practices (EBP) related to family planning (FP). Implementation science (IS) can help these efforts. The purpose of this article is to elucidate patterns in the use of IS in FP research and identify ways to maximize the potential of IS to advance FP in LMIC. Design and methods: We conducted a systematic review that describes how IS concepts and principles have been operationalized in LMIC FP research published from 2007-2021. We searched six databases for implementation studies of LMIC FP interventions. Our review synthesizes the characteristics of implementation strategies and research efforts used to enhance the performance of FP-related EBP in these settings, identifying gaps, strengths and lessons learned. Results: Four-hundred and seventy-two studies were eligible for full-text review. Ninety-two percent of studies were carried out in one region only, whereas 8 percent were multi-country studies that took place across multiple regions. 37 percent of studies were conducted in East Africa, 21 percent in West and Central Africa, 19 percent in Southern Africa and South Asia, respectively, and fewer than 5 percent in other Asian countries, Latin America and Middle East and North Africa, respectively. Fifty-four percent were on strategies that promoted individuals' uptake of FP. Far fewer were on strategies to enhance the coverage, implementation, spread or sustainability of FP programs. Most studies used quantitative methods only and evaluated user-level outcomes over implementation outcomes. Thirty percent measured processes and outcomes of strategies, 15 percent measured changes in implementation outcomes, and 31 percent report on the effect of contextual factors. Eighteen percent reported that they were situated within decision-making processes to address locally identified implementation issues. Fourteen percent of studies described measures to involve stakeholders in the research process. Only 7 percent of studies reported that implementation was led by LMIC delivery systems or implementation partners. Conclusions: IS has potential to further advance LMIC FP programs, although its impact will be limited unless its concepts and principles are incorporated more systematically. To support this, stakeholders must focus on strategies that address a wider range of implementation outcomes; adapt research designs and blend methods to evaluate outcomes and processes; and establish collaborative research efforts across implementation, policy, and research domains. Doing so will expand opportunities for learning and applying new knowledge in pragmatic research paradigms where research is embedded in usual implementation conditions and addresses critical issues such as scale up and sustainability of evidence-informed FP interventions.

AB  - Urban expansion is a major threat to diversity, especially in rapidly developing tropical countries where urban areas are growing at great pace and protection is limited. We conducted a systematic review of published research on the ecology of lentic habitats in tropical urban areas. The review focused on understanding: (1) how much is currently known about the biodiversity of these habitats; (2) whether this knowledge is biased towards certain taxonomic groups and/or geographic areas; (3) what is known about the factors influencing their diversity; and (4) which ecosystem services urban lentic habitats provide. The review aimed to establish whether existing knowledge is sufficient to help guide conservation and provide evidence to policy makers of the importance of conserving tropical urban wetlands. We found 64 papers that addressed questions about the diversity and/or distribution of lentic ecosystems within tropical urban areas. Papers came from 15 countries, although almost half (45%) were from India; relatively few countries from Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, or South America were represented in the literature. Publication patterns revealed a growing interest in urban wetlands, but several biases and gaps were evident from the review. Firstly, papers generally focused on larger natural or semi-natural wetlands, with other types and sizes of lentic habitat under-represented in published work. Secondly, most papers focused on a single site, with a limited number of multi-site, city-wide, or landscape-scale diversity assessments. Thirdly, studies tended to focus on understanding the influence of water quality on diversity, with work assessing the influence of physical habitat or factors related to dispersal and connectivity very limited. Finally, work assessing the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in tropical urban areas remains narrow in focus, with few quantitative assessments of the relationship between ecological characteristics and ecosystem functions and services. We suggest a number of research focal points and approaches to help address these biases. Research is needed to improve understanding of the distribution patterns tropical freshwater species in urban areas and of the relationships between species diversity and a wider set of environmental and spatial conditions. Overall, there is a need for diversity assessments of tropical urban wetlands of all types and sizes, especially new and novel habitats, and scope for much greater adoption of ecosystem service concepts and evaluation tools to help emphasise the importance of these habitats.

AB  - The imminent threat to food security requires immediate intervention toward ensuring societal sustainability especially in combating the pandemic. The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases has caused concern for food security. A recent outlook report produced by Food Agricultural Organization and World Food Programme (FAO-WTP) highlights that there are at least 20 countries that are faced with a looming threat of food availability between the period of March-July 2021. Other factors that pose a significant threat to food security include climate change and natural disasters which could significantly reduce the yield. It is hence imperative to gain an in-depth understanding of factors that influence farmers' choices in innovation adoption for increased yield. A line of research has been conducted across the globe on new technology adoption and effect of innovation that aims to increase productivity and yield. This study examined the key factors, that lead farmers to the adoption of new technology and innovation, reported in studies over the past 15 years. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) was employed based on the SCOPUS and Web of Science database. In creating the main dataset, a protocol was developed in advance to document the analysis method. Several inclusion (eligibility) and exclusion criteria were set to select related articles from a total of 2,136 papers. The thematic and content analyses were subsequently performed on 392 research articles. The findings indicate 4 over-arching segments, and 12 major determinants, that comprise 62 associate determinants. The paper concludes with the identification of critical factors for innovation adoption amongst farmers.

AB  - Sustainable water management has vital ramifications for people's societal, economic and environmental future. To advance research in this domain, this article synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding water resource management in the residential context. The aim of this paper is to identify research gaps and future research directions for residential water management in order to recommend solutions against water scarcity. To that end, this article applies bibliometric analysis and the Antecedents, Decisions and Outcomes (ADO) framework to the literature on residential sustainable water management. We reviewed the most impactful journals, most frequently cited articles, keyword trends and density-centrality maps. The in-depth analysis on 114 articles underscored three orientations for residential water usage and management: urban, household and consumer. Based on this analysis, we were able to identify the significant topics that structure this research field, as well as research gaps and future directions.

AB  - Soil degradation is one of the main environmental issues within the international agendas on sustainability and climate adaptation. Among degradation processes, soil sealing represents the major threat, as ecosystem services dramatically decrease or are even nullified. The increasing use of big open data from satellites combined with AI algorithms are making geodata mining and mapping techniques essential to quantify soil sealing. Different keywords are adopted to define the phenomenon. However, at present, review articles presenting the state-of-the-art on mapping soil sealing by including the most common definitions are currently not available. Hence, we analyzed: (a) impervious surface, (b) soil sealing, (c) land take, (d) soil consumption, (e) land consumption. We provide a systematic review of remote sensing platforms and methodologies to map and to classify soil sealing, by highlighting: (a) definitions; (b) relationships among study areas, scales, platforms, resolutions, and classification methodologies; (c) emerging trends and policy implications. We performed a systematic search on Scopus (from 2000 to 2020), identifying 1277 papers; 392 focused on mapping soil sealing. 'Impervious surface' is the dominant definition. The phenomenon is more studied by the USA, China and Italy and, 'soil sealing' is recently more adopted in EU. Most studies focuses on mapping soil sealing at urban scale. We found Landsat are the most adopted platforms; they are frequently used for multi-temporal analyses. Eleven methodologies were identified: automatic classifications are the most adopted, dominated by pixel/sub-pixel-based approaches; other methods include Band Ratios, Supervised, OBIA, ANN. The majority of mapping analyses are performed on 30 m resolution in areas of 1000-10 000 km(2). Landsat images are less used for smaller areas. In conclusion, as study area size increases, a decrease in image resolution with the use of more completely automatic classification methodologies is recorded. However, most studies focuses on comparing classification techniques rather than supporting policy making for sustainable urban planning. Thus, we encourage to fill the gap by developing approaches that applicable to international policies.

AB  - Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally, with an increasing incidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The successful treatment of acute stroke requires an organized, efficient and well-resourced emergency care system. However, debate exists surrounding the prioritization of stroke treatment programs given the high costs of treatment and the increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in LMICs. Economic data is helpful to guide evidence-based priority setting in health systems development, particularly in low-resource settings where scarcity requires careful stewardship of resources. This systematic review surveys the existing evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of interventions to address acute stroke in LMIC settings.
   Methods: The authors conducted a PRISMA style systematic review of economic evaluations of interventions to address acute stroke in LMICs. Five databases were systematically searched for articles, which were then reviewed for inclusion.
   Results: Of the 153 unique articles identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Four studies demonstrate the heavy economic burden on patients and households due to stroke. Two studies estimate that preventive measures are more cost-effective than acute treatments. Four studies directly examine the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis and thrombectomy in three middle-income countries (Iran, China, and Brazil) with results ranging from roughly $2578 to $34,052 (2019 USD) per quality adjusted life-year saved. These results are similar to the cost-effectiveness ratios estimated in high-income settings. Finally, one study examined a care bundle that included acute treatment elements.
   Conclusions: The findings reinforce the need for additional research support informed decision-making. The available evidence suggests that preventive measures should be prioritized over emergency treatment for acute stroke, particularly in settings of resource scarcity. Cost-effectiveness ratios do not compare favorably to estimates for other emergency care interventions in LMICs, such as basic emergency care training, implementation of triage systems, and basic trauma care. Cost-effectiveness is also likely to vary depending on local epidemiology. Overall, decision-makers should balance the economic evidence alongside social, political and cultural priorities when making resource allocation choices.

AB  - Introduction: Despite improved efficacy of, and access to, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-associated cognitive impairments remain prevalent in both children and adults. Neuropsychological tests that detect such impairment can help clinicians formulate effective treatment plans. The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC), although developed and standardized in the United States, is used frequently in many different countries and cultural contexts to assess paediatric performance across various cognitive domains. This systematic review investigated the cross-cultural utility of the original KABC, and its 2nd edition (KABC-II), in detecting HIV-associated cognitive impairment in children and adolescents.
   Methods: We entered relevant keywords and MeSH terms into the PubMed, PsycInfo, EBSCOHost, ProQuest, and Scopus databases, with search limits set from 1983-2017. Two independent reviewers evaluated the retrieved abstracts and manuscripts. Studies eligible for inclusion in the review were those that (a) used the KABC/KABC-II to assess cognitive function in children/adolescents aged 2-18 years, (b) featured a definition of cognitive impairment (e.g. >2 SD below the mean) or compared the performance of HIV-infected and uninfected control groups, and (c) used a sample excluded from population on which the instruments were normed.
   Results and discussion: We identified nine studies (eight conducted in African countries, and one in the United Kingdom) to comprise the review's sample. All studies detected cognitive impairment in HIV-infected children, including those who were cART-naive or who were cART treated and clinically stable. KABC/KABC-II subtests assessing simultaneous processing appeared most sensitive. Evaluation of the methodological quality of the selected studies by two independent reviews suggested that shortcomings included reporting and selection biases.
   Conclusions: This systematic review provides evidence for the cross-cultural utility of the KABC/KABC-II, particularly the simultaneous processing subtests, in detecting cognitive impairment in HIV-infected children (including those who are clinically stable). Although the current results suggest there is justification for using the KABC/KABC-II primarily in East Africa, further investigation is required to explore the instrument's utility in other HIV-prevalent regions of the globe.

AB  - The health consequences of human trafficking have been poorly researched compared to other aspects of this crime. A systematic review was carried out to study health from a broader perspective, beyond psychophysical symptoms, to understand the global impact of human trafficking on sexual, social, physical, and psychological health. The search identified many studies focused on the violence of sex trafficking in female samples. This work leads us to conclude that social health is an important dimension of the well-being of trafficking victims. More studies are needed on aspects of social health, especially regarding research gaps related to spirituality and nutrition, thus continuing preventing and combating human trafficking. Many gender biases were also discovered: unlike studies of trafficking in women, the few studies on men did not look at parenting, sexual health, marital status, or sex trafficking.

AB  - Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) motivate effective measures for safeguarding public health. There is consensus that HIAs in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are lacking, but no study systematically focuses on those that have been successfully conducted across all regions of the world, nor do they highlight factors that may enable or hinder their implementation. Our objectives are to (1) systematically review, geographically map, and characterize HIA activity in LMICs; and (2) apply a process evaluation method to identify factors which are important to improve HIA implementation in LMICs. A systematic review of peer-reviewed HIAs in 156 LMICs was performed in Scopus, Medline, Web of Science, Sociological abstracts, and LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences) databases. The search used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and covered HIAs across all type of interventions, topics, and health outcomes. HIAs were included if they reported a clear intervention and health outcome to be assessed. No time restriction was applied, and grey literature was not included. The eligible studies were subjected to six process evaluation criteria. The search yielded 3178 hits and 57 studies were retained. HIAs were conducted in 26 out of 156 countries. There was an unequal distribution of HIAs across regions and within LMICs countries. The leading topics of HIA in LMICs were air pollution, development projects, and urban transport planning. Most of the HIAs reported quantitative approaches (72%), focused on air pollution (46%), appraised policies (60%), and were conducted at the city level (36%). The process evaluation showed important variations in the way HIAs have been conducted and low uniformity in the reporting of six criteria. No study reported the time, money, and staff used to perform HIAs. Only 12% of HIAs were based on participatory approaches; 92% of HIAs considered multiple outcomes; and 61% of HIAs provided recommendations and fostered cross-national collaboration. The limited transparency in process, weak participation, and inconsistent delivery of recommendations were potential limitations to HIA implementation in low and middle-income countries. Scaling and improving HIA implementation in low and middle-income countries in the upcoming years will depend on expanding geographically by increasing HIA governance, adapting models and tools in quantitative methods, and adopting better reporting practices.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this article is (1) to carry out an ambivalent analysis of the determinants (benefits/risks) of the adoption of cultured meat, (2) to identify their impacts on consumers' attitudes (cognitive, affective and conative) and (3) to propose a research agenda.Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted. The authors selected 86 articles that were coded using NVivo 12 software according to the theoretical framework chosen for this study: (1) consumer attitude ambivalence (benefit-risk) - conflicting presence of positive and negative attitudes in decision-making, (2) the consumer preference theory - choice of consumers based on utility maximisation or best characteristics/determinants and (3) the three-dimensional perspective of attitude - cognitive, affective and behavioural components. The authors followed the methodological steps (formulation of the research question, identification of relevant scientific studies, evaluation of the quality of studies, summary of evidence and interpretation of results) recommended by Lipsey and Wilson (2001) and Tranfield et al. (2003). Several keywords were drawn from a study by Bryant and Barnett (2019) on cultured meat (CM) nomenclature and its impact on consumer acceptance.Findings - The identified articles were relatively recent (84/86 articles were published after 2010) and in the fields of agriculture and ethical agriculture (22/86), policy and regulations (12/86) and psychology (11/86). Content analysis helped identify four types of ambivalent determinants for the adoption of cultured meat: ethics, intrinsic, informational and belief. The results suggest the existence of a group of "dominant " determinants for each attitude component. Thus, the dominant determinants of cognitive, affective and conative components are informational, ethical and intrinsic determinants, respectively.Research limitations/implications - This research is based on a systematic review of literature and is a review of the narrative literature that provides an overview of what is known about cultured meat adoption. The main weakness of this type of method is the feasibility generally associated with the existence (and a sufficient number) of studies that can be included. Other types of the meta-analytic method could have been used and could have explored different measures and biases (e.g. effect sizes, statistical power, sampling error, measurement error and publication bias). Also, as a food technology whose social acceptability would be influenced by all stakeholders, it would be relevant to expand the analysis to other types of stakeholders.Practical implications - Little is still known to the public about the adoption mechanisms of this technology. In terms of behaviour, Siegrist et al. (2018) suggest that new studies should focus on factors that influence the individual differences in the willingness of consumers to eat or purchase cultured meat. By identifying the dominant target influence of informational determinants on cognitive components, that of ethical determinants on affective components and finally that of intrinsic determinants on conative attitudes, this article offers a first avenue of solution to businesses operating in this new industry, as well as to public authorities, to improve the acceptance of cultured meat.Private businesses will benefit from the results of this research by understanding the underlying motivations of consumers to adopt this type of innovation in order to adjust future marketing.
   Social implications - This article, through better understanding of the psychological mechanisms that contribute to its social acceptability amongst the population, has the potential to improve educational campaigns for this technology. The results could thus guide both public policies as well as the regulation of activities related to cultured meat in the coming years, professional orders, private businesses and the general public. It thus provides initial insight needed to understand this public debate. Originality/value - Research addressing cultured meat has come primarily from agribusiness and environmental and biological sciences. The authors highlighted the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between biological and social sciences to address ethical issues. This article, via multidisciplinary systematic reviews, links environmental/biological sciences and social sciences, and management.

AB  - Background. To update and expand on a 2012 systematic review of the prevalence and risk of violence and the prevalence and risk of physical, mental and sexual health problems among trafficked people.
   Method. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches of 15 electronic databases of peer-reviewed articles and doctoral theses were supplemented by reference screening, citation tracking of included articles and expert recommendations. Studies were included if they reported on the prevalence or risk of violence while trafficked, or the prevalence or risk of physical, mental or sexual health outcomes among people who have been trafficked. Two reviewers independently screened papers for eligibility and appraised the quality of included studies.
   Results. Thirty-seven papers reporting on 31 studies were identified. The majority of studies were conducted in low and middle-income countries with women and girls trafficked into the sex industry. There is limited but emerging evidence on the health of trafficked men and the health consequences of trafficking into different forms of exploitation. Studies indicate that trafficked women, men and children experience high levels of violence and report significant levels of physical health symptoms, including headaches, stomach pain and back pain. Most commonly reported mental health problems include depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although serological data on sexually transmitted infections are limited, women and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation self-report symptoms suggestive of a high prevalence of infections. Limitations of the review include methodological weaknesses of primary studies and some differences in definition and operationalisation of trafficking, which hinder comparability and generalisability of the results.
   Conclusions. There is increasing evidence human trafficking is associated with high prevalence and increased risk of violence and a range of physical and mental health problems. Although more studies have emerged in recent years reporting on the health of trafficked men and people trafficked for forms of exploitation other than in the sex industry, further research is needed in this area. Appropriate interventions and support services to address the multiple and serious medical needs, especially mental health, of trafficked people are urgently needed.

AB  - Mental health, a key component of social sustainability, costs 1.6 pound trillion globally and office workers are among the most affected. However, social sustainability is the least considered sustainability dimension by businesses. Although the literature associates human exposure to nature with positive mental health, there are limited critical reviews of nature exposure impact on office workers. The aim of this research was to demonstrate the impact of nature exposure on office workers by consolidating empirical research evidence and to provide insight into how it can contribute to achieving integrated sustainability. A total of 42 peer-reviewed journal articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected. A systematic review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework was conducted. The results show that indoor nature exposure contributes to social sustainability through its impact on workers' health and motivation while outdoor nature exposure contributes to economic, environmental and social sustainability through its impact on workers' restoration, stress reduction and stress coping. Workplace design should therefore embed both indoor and outdoor nature exposure to maximise impacts on employees and achieve integrated sustainability. The nature exposure network developed in this research will facilitate design decisions regarding nature exposure in workplaces to maximise the impact on employees' well-being and performance.

AB  - Chronic diseases within Indigenous communities constitute the most compelling ill-health burdens and treatment inequalities, particularly in rural and remote Australia. In response to these vital issues, a systematic literature review of the adoption of wearable, Artificial Intelligence-driven, electrocardiogram sensors, in a telehealth Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) context was conducted to scale up rural Indigenous health. To this end, four preselected scientific databases were chosen for data extraction to align with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. From the initially collected (������ = 4436) articles, a total of 32 articles were analysed, being synthesised from the review inclusion criteria, maintaining strict eligibility and eliminating duplicates. None of the various studies found on this innovative healthcare intervention has given a comprehensive picture of how this could be an effective method of care dedicated to rural Indigenous communities with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Herein, we presented the unique concepts of IoMT-driven wearable biosensors tailored for rural indigenous cardiac patients, their clinical implications, and cardiovascular disease management within the telehealth domain. This work contributes to understanding the adoption of wearable IoMT sensor-driven telehealth model, highlighting the need for real-time data from First Nations patients in rural and remote areas for CVD prevention. Pertinent implications, research impacts, limitations and future research directions are endorsed, securing long-term Wearable IoMT sensor-driven telehealth sustainability.

AB  - Background: Fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) in Asia and the Middle-East contribute significantly to global maternal and neonatal deaths. This systematic review explored maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services usage and determinants in FCS in Asia and the Middle-East to inform policy on health service provision in these challenging settings.
   Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a standardised protocol. Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and selected development agency websites were searched for studies meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using an adapted evaluation tool. Qualitative and quantitative data were synthesized and pooled odds ratios generated for meta-analysis of service-usage determinants.
   Results: Of 18 eligible peer-reviewed studies, eight were from Nepal, four from Afghanistan, and two each from Iraq, Yemen, and the Palestinian Territories. Fragile situations provide limited evidence on emergency obstetric care, postnatal care, and newborn services. Usage of MNH services was low in all FCS, irrespective of economic growth level. Demand-side determinants of service-usage were transportation, female education, autonomy, health awareness, and ability-to-pay. Supply-side determinants included service availability and quality, existence of community health-workers, costs, and informal payments in health facilities. Evidence is particularly sparse on MNH in acute crises, and remains limited in fragile situations generally.
   Conclusions: Findings emphasize that poor MNH status in FCS is a leading contributor to the burden of maternal and neonatal ill-health in Asia and the Middle-East. Essential services for skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric, newborn, and postnatal care require improvement in FCS.

AB  - This article aims to review the current literature pertaining to the effects of eating local seasonal food on sustainable consumption. To this end, we examined definitions of seasonal and local food, the methodological approaches adopted to study the impact of seasonal consumption on sustainability, and sustainability dimensions investigated in journal articles. Highlighting what seasonal and local means, it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the consumption of these foods on sustainability. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science database in line with the recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our findings suggest that the concept of local seasonality provides relevant information to the study of sustainable consumption. However, for better use of this concept, it is crucial to define what is local. At this point, regulation of labels based on geographic proximity or political boundaries proves pertinent.

AB  - Risk-sensitive urban development is an innovative planning approach that can transform the way cities are built in order to face the uncertainties that arise from climate-induced disaster risks. However, the potential to initiate such a transformative approach has not materialized because of the many underlying issues that need to be understood properly. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review to gather empirical evidence on the issues and challenges in implementing risk-sensitive urban development. The study identified forty-six issues and challenges under seven key themes that need addressing in order to facilitate the desirable transition: trade-offs, governance, fragmentation and silos, capacity, design and development, data, and funding. The issues and challenges that exist under trade-offs for negotiating solutions for risk-sensitive urban development and the governance of multiple stakeholders were identified as the top two areas that need attention in facilitating the desirable transition. This study also revealed that important information, such as scientific information, hazard and risk information, temporal and spatial information, and critical local details are not being produced and shared between stakeholders in decision-making. A profound participatory process that involves all the stakeholders in the decision-making process was identified as the pathway to ensure equitable outcomes in risk-sensitive urban development.

AB  - Shifting cultivation has been attributed to causing large-scale deforestation and forest degradation in tropical forest-agriculture frontiers. This view has been embedded in many policy documents in the tropics, although, there are conflicting views within the literature as to the impacts of shifting cultivation. In part, this may be due to the complex nature of this land use making generalizations challenging. Here we provided a systematic map of research conducted on shifting cultivation in tropics. We first developed a literature search protocol using IS! Web of Science that identified 401 documents which met the search criteria. The spatial and temporal distribution of research related to shifting cultivation was mapped according to research focus. We then conducted a meta-analysis of studies (n = 73) that focused on forest dynamics following shifting cultivation. A bias in research on anthropology/human ecology was evident, with most research reported from the tropical Asia Pacific region (215 studies). Other key research foci were - soil nutrients and chemistry (72 studies), plant ecology (62 studies), agricultural production/management (57 studies), agroforestry (35 studies), geography/land-use transitions (26 studies). Our meta-analysis revealed a great variability in findings on selected forest and environmental parameters from the studies examined. Studies on ecology were mainly concentrated on plant diversity and successional development, while conservation biology related studies were focused on birds. Limited impacts of shifting cultivation on some soil essential nutrients were also apparent. Apart from the intensity of past usage site spatial attributes seems critical for the successful development of fallow landscapes to secondary forests. Further research is needed to help ascertain the environmental consequences of this traditional land-use on tropical forests. Scientists and policy makers also need to be cautious when making generalizations about the impacts of shifting cultivation and to the both the social and environmental context in which shifting cultivation is being undertaken.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that climate change can escalate the risks for violent conflict through various pathways. Existing evidence suggests that contextual factors, such as migration and livelihood options, governance arrangements, and existing conflict dynamics, can influence the pathways through which climate change leads to conflict. This important insight leads to an inquiry to identify sets of conditions and processes that make climate-related violent conflict more likely. In this analytic essay, we conduct a systematic review of scholarly literature published during the period 1989-2022 and explore the climate-conflict pathways in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Through the systematic review of forty-one peer-reviewed publications in English, we identify that society's ability to cope with the changing climate and extreme weather events is influenced by a range of factors, including preceding government policies that led to the mismanagement of land and water and existing conflict dynamics in the MENA region. Empirical research to unpack the complex and diverse relationship between the climate shocks and violent conflict in the MENA region needs advancing. Several avenues for future research are highlighted such as more studies on North Africa and the Gulf region, with focus on the implications of floods and heatwaves, and exploring climate implications on non-agriculture sectors including the critical oil sector.

AB  - Farmland birds belong to the most endangered group of vertebrates in Europe. They are an important component of farmland biodiversity considering the numerous functions they perform (e.g. seed dispersal, improving germination, increasing gene flow, nutrient recycling, and pest control). Therefore, their decline imposes substantial risks on agricultural ecosystems. In general, farmland bird conservation includes land-use and management alterations leading to less-intensive farming and land-sparing for breeding habitats (e.g. agri-environment-climate schemes, and organic farming). However, theoretical concepts describing farmland biodiversity maintenance and applied conservation measures usually ignore the role of singular, often very small, natural or man-made elements in an agricultural landscape. These elements play a role in the populations of certain species, their biology and in the general species richness of farmland. Furthermore, the importance of these elements has never been empirically tested, which means that conservationists and practitioners are not aware of their measurable value for birds. Herein, we define and identify singular point elements in the agricultural landscape (SPELs) which are potentially important for breeding farmland birds. We also describe each SPEL and evaluate its importance for birds in farmland based on a systematic review of the available literature. Using a horizon-scanning technique, we then polled field ornithologists about their personal observations of birds in relation to SPELs and the evaluation of the potential roles of such structures for birds. We identified 17 SPELs that vary in naturalness and age: singular trees, singular shrubs, erratic boulders, puddles, electricity pylons, wind turbines, spiritual sites, hunting platforms, fence and border posts, wells, road signs, scarecrows, piles of manure, piles of brushwood/branches, piles of stones/debris, piles of lime, and haystacks. Analysis of the literature revealed knowledge gaps, because some SPELs are frequently mentioned in ecological studies (e.g. trees, shrubs, pylons), but others such as spiritual sites, stones, hunting platforms, wells, road signs, or piles of lime are ignored. Despite the fact that some authors incorporate the effects of some SPELs in their studies, little research to date has aimed to assess the impact of various SPELs on farmland bird species numbers and distribution. Horizon scanning revealed that ornithologists often observe birds on various SPELs and thus, attribute to SPELs many functions that are important for maintaining bird populations. Horizon scanning also highlighted the importance of SPELs for many declining bird species and suggested possible mitigation of negative changes in the agricultural landscape by retaining SPELs within fields. We suggest that a better understanding of the role of SPELs for farmland birds is required. We also recommend that SPELs are considered as a potential tool for the conservation of birds, and existing conservation programs such as agri-environment-climate schemes and organic farming should be updated accordingly. Finally, we suggest that SPELs are included in predictive models that evaluate habitat suitability for farmland biodiversity.

AB  - The Water Energy Food nexus is a powerful topic in agricultural systems to elucidate threats to biodiversity conservation and culture. This paper aimed to recapitulate nexus thinking research, focusing on social-ecological transitions of agriculture systems and biodiversity management within the Water-Energy-Food nexus. We developed a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis derived from 529 documents in the Scopus database. The ToS method identified a total of 81 relevant information in the sample of documents (529) categorised into roots (10), trunks (9) and leaves (62). This review paper situates types, focus, and highlights regarding biodiversity and prevalent thematic research areas such as "Food Nexus", "Environmental Flows", "Sustainability", "Transitions", and "Governance". Our results suggest that future research should focus on the nexus of "Water-Energy-Food-Biodiversity" and propose a transdisciplinary approach to elucidate the state of sustainability transitions in the agricultural systems at the landscape level. It could increase stakeholder interest in conservation, and sustainability management, to reverse biodiversity losses in ecosystems.

AB  - For many Indigenous communities, decreased participation in traditional land-based activities has led to higher rates of chronic disease and a decrease in well-being. This systematic review explores how traditional land-based activities impact self-reported health and well-being of Indigenous adults, using Indigenous and Western perspectives. A search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) identified nine studies which explored the experiences and perspectives of Indigenous adults taking part in land-based subsistence and ceremonial activities. A thematic analysis of these studies identified many interconnected physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, and community benefits. Community engagement throughout all stages of the interventions was an important factor in effectively addressing challenges and barriers stemming from colonization, decreased knowledge transfer, and increased use of technology. Participants reported developing more effective stress management techniques, a greater awareness of modifiable risk factors along with increased engagement with Elders. Ultimately, land-based subsistence and ceremonial activities were identified as playing an influential role in the lives of Indigenous adults. The involvement of community members allowed for the development of more culturally relevant interventions. Future community-specific research is needed to increase engagement in traditional physical-activities, improve well-being and overall reduce the risk of chronic disease.

AB  - Food security will become increasingly challenged over the coming decades, and sustainable intensification is often touted as an ideal way to increase yields while limiting negative environmental impacts. Yet, the extent to which sustainable intensification can increase yields remains unclear. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the extent to which sustainable intensification can increase yields across South Asia, a region that is expected to face some of the greatest food security challenges over the coming decades. We found that yield gains from sustainable intensification interventions were heterogeneous, and that the average yield gain across all studi es was 21%. Residue retention and the use of organic fertilizers were, in particular, associated with significant and positive yield gains, though the use of organic fertilizers was not always profitable, likely due to large subsidies provided for mineral fertilizers across South Asia. Our work also revealed biases in the current sustainable intensification literature, with research clustered in highly productive, irrigated, and commodity cropping systems, which do not represent large portions of agricultural systems across South Asia. Our results highlight that sustainable intensification interventions should play an important role in increasing food production across South Asia, but yield gains from these interventions are modest compared to estimated yield gaps across the region.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology that has been widely used to evaluate the environmental impact of products and processes throughout entire life cycles. In this context, the reuse of waste in paved road construction is a practice that has received increasing attention as a sustainable alternative to solid waste disposal. This article presents a systematic review of existing studies on the LCA of paved roads that incorporate waste reuse and proposes a guideline for LCA in this context. Several criteria were analyzed in the articles, and the results showed that only 5% of the articles followed all the recommendations set out in ISO 14040. The proposed guideline aims to provide guidance for future research and includes recommendations for each of the steps involved in LCA, from defining the objectives and scope of the study to interpreting the results.

AB  - IntroductionBay Areas are viewed as a complex region with integrated objectives and numerous functions. Despite the increasing interaction between bay area development and urban landscape transformation, the fragmented literature did not address the question: how to achieve sustainable development in the bay area? The objective of this study was to review the literature on four representative bay areas from both the West and the East, including the San Francisco Bay Area, New York Bay Area, Tokyo Bay Area, and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. This study aimed to address the following two questions: What are the ongoing research trends in the field of bay areas? What are the most critical urban issues for future bay area development? MethodsThis study used a systematic review to examine publications from the Scopus database. Both descriptive and evaluative approaches were employed to analyze the publications on the four representative bay areas. The bibliometric analysis was performed using the VOS viewer to visualize research results and outcomes. ResultsThe results revealed that the majority of the bay area related studies emphasized environmental issues, focused on decentralization and policy interactions, and the field of education received limited attention. DiscussionThis study contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the city-region development and provides policy suggestions for future sustainable bay area development. The findings of the keyword-based bibliometric analysis can be applied to other realms of city studies.

There appears to be a mixture of empirical and conceptual articles, with a larger proportion being empirical but an increasing number leaning towards a conceptual nature. Our findings show that most studies follow a quantitative approach and use large samples, mostly originating from existing databases. There is an emergence of thematic areas related to the strategic factors influencing M&As, but with the human dimension, gaining increasing attention over time.

AB  - Rapid urbanization trends claim long-term urban planning and management strategies towards a more sustainable urban growth. In this context, neighborhoods show as fundamental units in large-scale sustainable approaches of socio-economic indicators to be replicated in urban development models. However, the number of evaluated districts is still too low compared to the number of buildings evaluated so far. To lay the potential weaknesses and strengths behind the use of sustainable certification tools at district level, the present study aims to examine all realized neighborhoods aligned with sustainability goals. To this end, a systematic review (SR) on neighborhood case studies that directly or indirectly employed neighborhood sustainable assessment (NSA) tools - in particular, amongst LEED-ND, BREEAM-C, CASBEE-UD, and Green Star-Community, DGNB-NSQ, - or that denied the applicability of NSA tools to develop tailored ones is provided. Case studies found in academic papers and NSA-tool official websites are examined through five research questions (RQs): i) number and level of certifications; ii) geographical and temporal distribution; iii) availability of data related to physical characteristics (i.e., size, density, number of dwellings, etcetera); iv) variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) addressed; v) authors outcomes. Evaluation of these realized case studies testified the practicality of NSA for achieving carbon neutrality target. However, the lack of data consistency and the significance given to the contextual features hindered the replication of the previous experiences and nudged the development of custom fitted NSA tools. A more flexible framework adaptable to different contextual priorities and integrative of neighborhood projects worldwide is recommended.

AB  - Carbon dioxide transport plays a crucial role in carbon capture and storage systems. As an economical and convenient carrier, pipelines have huge advantages in the transport of carbon dioxide. In this paper, the development of carbon dioxide transport via pipeline is systematically reviewed from four aspects: pipeline design, process, risk and safety, standard and specification. The results reveal that there are many similarities between the carbon dioxide pipeline and the natural gas pipeline, but due to different gas compositions and transportation destinations, the transport process, design, and construction considerations are quite different. Especially in terms of management, the specifications and standards for carbon dioxide pipelines are still minimal, the techno-economic framework and integrity management system are still immature. In addition, this paper summaries the challenges and future directions of carbon dioxide transport via pipeline. It is concluded that the studies on the influence of impurities on phase equilibrium and corrosion mechanisms in carbon dioxide pipeline are challenges, and the new construction and detection technologies are also crucial. With the rapid development of computer science, some interdisciplinary applications such as artificial intelligence and digital twin will promote the development of carbon dioxide pipeline.

AB  - Blue spaces have been found to have significant salutogenic effects. However, little is known about the mechanisms and pathways that link blue spaces and health. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarise the evidence and quantify the effect of blue spaces on four hypothesised mediating pathways: physical activity, restoration, social interaction and environmental factors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using six databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCOHOST/CINAHL). Fifty studies were included in our systematic review. The overall quality of the included articles, evaluated with the Qualsyst tool, was judged to be very good, as no mediating pathway had an average article quality lower than 70%. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for physical activity, restoration and social interaction. Living closer to blue space was associated with statistically significantly higher physical activity levels (Cohen's d = 0.122, 95% CI: 0.065, 0.179). Shorter distance to blue space was not associated with restoration (Cohen's d = 0.123, 95% CI: -0.037, 0.284) or social interaction (Cohen's d = -0.214, 95% CI: -0.55, 0.122). Larger amounts of blue space within a geographical area were significantly associated with higher physical activity levels (Cohen's d = 0.144, 95% CI: 0.024, 0.264) and higher levels of restoration (Cohen's d = 0.339, 95% CI: 0.072, 0.606). Being in more contact with blue space was significantly associated with higher levels of restoration (Cohen's d = 0.191, 95% CI: 0.084, 0.298). There is also evidence that blue spaces improve environmental factors, but more studies are necessary for meta-analyses to be conducted. Evidence is conflicting on the mediating effects of social interaction and further research is required on this hypothesised pathway. Blue spaces may offer part of a solution to public health concerns faced by growing global urban populations.

AB  - Research in the last decade has emphasised the potential contribution of traditional ecological knowledge to cope with challenges from global environmental change. This research examines the role of traditional ecological knowledge and shared systems of beliefs in building long-term social-ecological resilience to environmental extremes. Data were collected from 13 villages of the Donana region, southwestern Spain, through interviews, focus groups, and systematic reviews of historical archives. First, we assess adaptive practices to cope with environmental change. Then, we use historical records of religious ceremonies (1577-1956) to reconstruct collective responses to environmental extremes. Our results (1) show how environmental extremes could induce social and economic crises through declines in ecosystem services and (2) identify practices to cope with recurrent disturbance and institutional devices developed in response to environmental extremes. We conclude that traditional ecological knowledge and shared systems of beliefs can facilitate collective responses to crises and contribute to the maintenance of long-term resilience of social-ecological systems.

AB  - The study of ecosystem services enables the understanding of the services that ecosystems provide at the landscape level by explaining the relationship between natural capital, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing. The limited number of studies summarizing important themes and approaches used in this area constrain the ability of scholars and practitioners to initiate or incorporate ecosystem services in their own domains of research. This paper develops a structured process that traces efforts in this domain of knowledge and proposes a systematic review of key themes and approaches that have developed over the last 40 years. Further, this study identifies emerging and dominant areas of interest in the field. Key themes represent underlying meanings or ideas widely used in the ecosystem services field and includes trending or rising topics. Approaches include tools, frameworks, perspectives and management strategies to analyze, assess, and quantify ecosystem services. Analyses showed that, among key themes, conservation of biodiversity and landscape planning had the most activity and interest. Among approaches, economic valuation showed the highest levels of activity, while conceptual framework was the most cited. This review paper contributes a guide to progress in ecosystem service research and provides a comprehensive understanding of its evolution and development.

AB  - (1) Background: An outdoor gym (OG) is environmental infrastructure built in a public open space to promote structured physical activity. The provision of OGs is increasingly seen as an important strategy to realize public health agendas promoting habitual physical activity. A systematic review was conducted to synthesize characteristics of OG and OG users' experiences and perceptions in different cultural contexts; (2) Methods: Online searches of multidisciplinary databases were conducted in health, sport and recreation, and urban planning disciplines. Characteristics of OGs were synthesized by integrating evidence from quantitative, qualitative, and mix -methods studies. The experiences and perceptions of OG users from both qualitative data and survey responses were synthesized through framework analysis; (3) Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (three quantitative studies, four mixed -methods studies, and two pure qualitative studies). None were excluded on the basis of quality. OGs mainly serve adult and older adult population groups. Their size, design, and instructional support vary across studies. The inclusion of functional types of equipment did not have a unified standard. Regarding experiences and perceptions of OGs, five major themes emerged: "health", "social connectedness", "affordable", "support", and "design and promotion"; (4) Conclusions: The OG characteristics synthesis guides the direction in further studies regarding exploration of design parameters. The qualitative and quantitative synthesis revealed that health was a central theme of users' experiences. OGs are also spaces where community -dwellers can find social connectedness while participating in structured physical activity at no cost. Findings from this review create knowledge support for OG as environmental infrastructure for further research and facilitate the understanding of users' experiences and perceptions of OGs in different cultural contexts.

AB  - Colombia encompasses three mountain ranges that divide the country into five natural regions: Andes, Pacific, Caribbean, Amazon, and Orinoquia. These regions offer an impressive range of climates, altitudes, and landscapes, which lead to a high snake biodiversity. Of the almost 300 snake species reported in Colombia, nearly 50 are categorized as venomous. This high diversity of species contrasts with the small number of studies to characterize their venom compositions and natural history in the different ecoregions. This work reviews the available information about the venom composition, isolated toxins, and potential applications of snake species found in Colombia. Data compilation was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the systematic literature search was carried out in Pubmed/MEDLINE. Venom proteomes from nine Viperidae and three Elapidae species have been described using quantitative analytical strategies. In addition, venoms of three Colubridae species have been studied. Bioactivities reported for some of the venoms or isolated components-such as antibacterial, cytotoxicity on tumoral cell lines, and antiplasmodial properties-may be of interest to develop potential applications. Overall, this review indicates that, despite recent progress in the characterization of venoms from several Colombian snakes, it is necessary to perform further studies on the many species whose venoms remain essentially unexplored, especially those of the poorly known genus Micrurus.

AB  - Throughout the United States, many institutions of higher education own forested tracts, often called school forests, which they use for teaching, research, and demonstration purposes. These school forests provide a range of benefits to the communities in which they are located. However, because administration is often decoupled from research and teaching, those benefits might not always be evident to the individuals who make decisions about the management and use of school forests, which may undervalue their services and put these areas at risk for sale, development, or over-harvesting to generate revenue. To understand what messages are being conveyed about the value and relevance of school forests, we conducted a systematic literature review and qualitatively coded the resulting literature content using an ecosystem services framework. While school forests provide many important benefits to academic and local communities, we found that most of the existing literature omits discussions about cultural ecosystem services that people may receive from school forests. We discuss the implications of this omission and make recommendations for addressing it.

AB  - The previously neglected herbivore-aquatic macrophyte interaction has received more attention among scientists in the recent decades, especially in the context of biological invasions. However, there is still a great deal of work needed to improve scientific knowledge about this relationship and to improve biological management and control techniques. This systematic review provides an overview of temporal and spatial trends and the methodological approaches, habitats, and species most studied concerning this interaction. We evaluated scientific articles published in journals indexed to Web of Science that measured the consumption or other direct effects of herbivores on freshwater macrophytes, including non-native species. From 1992 to 2017, there was a growth rate of approximately three times in the publication of such articles, although they are concentrated in the temperate and subtropical zones, neglecting tropical and subpolar environments. We have also noticed a simple general pattern in most of the topics evaluated here, such as the low preference for using tests of multiple hypotheses and for applying both experimental and fieldwork methods together. Deep lakes and rivers were the most studied ecosystems, while shallow lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands had less attention. Non-native macrophytes were more studied than non-native herbivores. The macrophyte life forms most studies were rooted submerged, free-floating and emergent species, while the herbivore taxa most often examined in these studies were fish, molluscs and crustacea. We suggest performing studies that are more complex, using multi-species biological communities, with a focus on the unexplored pointed areas to advance scientific knowledge regarding herbivory on macrophytes, especially in tropical areas.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) mobilization and accumulation in the environment is directly related to forest fires. Biomass burning accounts for about 13% of the total contribution of Hg from natural sources. The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of how wildfires modify mercury compounds behaviour and the effects it has in the Hg cycle, based on a systematic bibliographic review and analysis. Systems dynamics is an adequate focus to analyze the mobilization of Hg due to wildfires, which meets all the requirements to be studied by multimedia modelling. The development and application for the first time of a dynamic multimedia model of Hg taking into account specifically the influences of wildfires is one of the novelties of this work. Different scenarios show that an increase in the number of fires will consequently increase the mercury emitted into the atmosphere, modifying its natural cycle, producing a long-term modification of Hg compositions and concentrations in the different media. Hg movement caused by wildfires can cause complications in living beings and alter the ecosystems. This study found that the Hg soil content could as well be an indicator to measure the impact of fire on the environment. This model can also be generalized to conduct additional studies under comparable conditions, helping to understand the importance of forest fires in global Hg cycles.

AB  - Sustainable consumer behavior (SCB) gained significant attention given the relevance it bears for a broad set of actors. Since most of the relevant literature is rooted in western countries, researchers and policymakers implicitly assume that behaviors in developing countries tend to replicate those in developed countries. This review, based on seventy-one articles published since 2000, questions such assumption by analyzing the empirical research on SCBs in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a distinctive region that has been so far overlooked by mainstream research. Results reveal that most MENA-based papers are rooted in traditional frameworks of the rationalistic stream and that environmental values represent a key driver of SCB, while habits and socio-demographics are relegated to a negligible role. This study provides an added value by synthesizing the fragmented evidence on the topic and discussing aspects emerging as peculiar of the MENA and differentiating the latter from other societies.

AB  - SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) related stigma is associated with lack of treatment adherence. Individual perceptions of stigma differ by societal context. Limited data are available on variations of TB stigma worldwide.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the influence of TB stigma on knowledge, attitudes and responses to TB and to identify similarities and differences across countries.
   DESIGN: Systematic review of international descriptive studies.
   RESULTS: A total of 1268 studies were identified from PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database searches. Eighty-three studies from 35 countries met the inclusion criteria for English, peer-reviewed, original and non-interventional studies. Variation and similarities in the influence of TB stigma on knowledge, attitudes and responses to TB across countries were identified. Stigma antecedents included negative attitudes and misperceptions regarding the causes of TB and the association with the human immunodeficiency virus. Decisions about illness disclosure and choices between traditional healers and public or private providers were influenced by TB stigma. Sex-influenced perceptions and management of TB and public health responses contributed to TB stigma.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm cultural variations with respect to TB and the potential for stigma. Cultural variations should be considered in the development of interventions aimed at reducing stigma and improving treatment adherence.

AB  - Private engagement has always been central to biodiversity conservation. Recently, the role of private enterprises in (eco)tourism have increased, and private lands play a pivotal role in expanding protected areas within societies throughout the world. This paper contributes to discussions of private engagement in conservation and its relation to tourism (recreation generally), with novel insight on how the conservation-tourism nexus on private land is approached in different geographical contexts. We present a systematic literature review that results in five thematic clusters characterized by different conservation approaches to tourism in Global North and South. Research concerning Global South tends to emphasize (eco)tourism as a main inducement for conservation, while research concerning Global North emphasizes expansion of private protected areas where access for tourist-recreational use has to be compensated. We propose a future research agenda to exploring environmentally and socially just approaches to conservation and recreation in both Global North and South.

AB  - Aims and objectives To systematically review and synthesise qualitative data from studies exploring the experiences of hospital staff who care for people living with dementia (Plwd).
   Background In hospital, the number of Plwd continues to rise; however, their experiences of care remain problematic. Negative experiences of care are likely to contribute to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for Plwd while in hospital and after discharge. Experiences of the hospital staff who care for Plwd can also be poor or unrewarding. It is important to understand the experiences of staff in order to improve staff well-being and ultimately the experience of care for Plwd while in hospital.
   Design Systematic review and evidence synthesis of qualitative research.
   Data sources We searched 16 electronic databases in March 2018 and completed forward and backward citation chasing.
   Methods Eligible studies explored the experiences of paid and unpaid staff providing care in hospital for Plwd. Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers, and quality appraisal was conducted. We prioritised included studies according to richness of text, methodological rigour and conceptual contribution. We adopted approaches of meta-ethnography to analyse study findings, creating a conceptual model to represent the line of argument.
   Findings Forty-five studies reported in 58 papers met the inclusion criteria, and of these, we prioritised 19 studies reported in 24 papers. The line of argument was that Institutions can improve staff experiences of care for Plwd by fostering person-centred care (PCC). PCC aligned with staff perceptions of 'good care'; however, staff often felt prevented from providing PCC because of care cultures that prioritised tasks, routines and physical health. Staff experienced conflict over the care they wanted to give versus the care they were able to give, and this caused moral distress. When staff were able to provide PCC, this increased experiences of job satisfaction and emotional well-being.
   Conclusions Person-centred care not only has the potential to improve the experience of care for Plwd and their carers, but can also improve the experiences of hospital staff caring for Plwd. However, without institutional-level changes, hospital staff are often unable to provide PCC even when they have the experience and knowledge to do so.
   Implications for practice Institutional-level areas for change include the following: training; performance indicators and ward cultures that prioritise psychological needs alongside physical needs; adequate staffing levels; inclusive approaches to carers; physical environments that promote familiarisation, social interaction and occupation; systems of documentation about individual needs of Plwd; and cultures of sharing knowledge across hierarchies.

AB  - First generation biofuels provide a number of ecosystem services (e.g., fuel, climate regulation) but they also compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services) which are of paramount value to human wellbeing. However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.

AB  - A systematic review of studies which reported on telediabetes services within Indigenous communities was undertaken in June 2016. The aim of this study was to identify enablers and barriers associated with the delivery of telehealth services for diabetes care amongst Indigenous people. A total of 14 articles met the study inclusion criteria, reporting work in Canada, Australia, India, and the US. Key enablers included the use of cultural and spiritual elements, acknowledgement of local beliefs and traditions, and appropriate community engagement. The involvement of Indigenous health workers was also very important because of their role in communication in local language, helping clinicians understand the community, and the transportation of patients. The main barriers associated with telediabetes services were the potentially high fail-to-attend rates, lack of technical skills associated with the operation of telehealth equipment, and the lack of availability of local staff. Knowledge of the enablers and barriers associated with the delivery of healthcare services to Indigenous communities is important when planning a telediabetes service.

AB  - Low-carbon cities (LCCs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers over the past 15 years as an important initiative for mitigating global warming. The increased pilot LCCs in several countries and focus on theoretical research suggest the need to explore the associated research topics and characteristics, trends, and challenges. An in-depth analysis of literature on LCCs was conducted using the three-phase research involving documents searching, quantitative analyses and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis revealed that nearly 70% of LCC research was conducted in three countries. The results of the quantitative analysis also generated a map of term clusters, which identified the 9 major areas. A qualitative analysis of the literature indicated that transition to low-carbon energy is the most intensively researched category, and LCC planning and design dominates the research field. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, this study reports knowledge gaps in the literature and proposes future directions for LCC research in the context of four major trends: LCC planning and design, low-carbon energy transition, low-carbon decision support, and low-carbon management and policy. This study improves the existing knowledge on LCC-related research and pro-vides a future guidance for theoretical research and pilot practices related to LCC.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health concerns; therefore, it is im-perative to advance our understanding of the factors influencing AMR from Global and One Health per-spectives. To address this, Aeromonas populations were identified using 16S rRNA gene libraries among human, agriculture, aquaculture, drinking water, surface water, and wastewater samples, supporting its use as indicator bacteria to study AMR. A systematic review and meta-analysis was then performed from Global and One Health perspectives, including data from 221 articles describing 15 891 isolates from 57 countries. The interconnectedness of different environments was evident as minimal differences were identified between sectors among 21 different antimicrobials. However, resistance to critically important antibiotics (aztreonam and cefepime) was significantly higher among wastewater populations compared with clinical isolates. Additionally, isolates from untreated wastewater typically exhibited increased AMR compared with those from treated wastewater. Furthermore, aquaculture was associated with increased AMR to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline compared with wild-caught seafood. Using the World Health Orga-nization AWaRe classifications, countries with lower consumption of "Access" compared to "Watch" drugs from 20 0 0 to 2015 demonstrated higher AMR levels. The current analysis revealed negative correlations between AMR and anthropogenic factors, such as environmental performance indices and socioeconomic standing. Environmental health and sanitation were two of the environmental factors most strongly cor-related with AMR. The current analysis highlights the negative impacts of "Watch" drug overconsumption, anthropogenic activity, absence of wastewater infrastructure, and aquaculture on AMR, thus stressing the need for proper infrastructure and global regulations to combat this growing problem.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. This systematic review aimed at examining the use patterns of Ethiopian anticancer traditional medicinal plants (MPs) in view of recommending further validation studies. Methods. The information was retrieved from PubMed according to the PRISMA guideline. The electronic library of Addis Ababa University and relevant church-based religious books were also inspected for additional data. Results. From 34 studies meeting specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, 119 anticancer MP species distributed in 98 genera and 57 families were recorded. Fabaceae (10.92 %) and Euphorbiaceae (10.08 %) were the most widely used families. Plumbago zeylanica (Plumbaginaceae) was the most frequently used anticancer MP species. Shrubs (42.02 %) and herbs (35.29 %) were dominant growth forms. About 89.08 % of the MPs were collected from wild habitats. Leaves (33.73 %) and roots (27.11 %) were the most frequently harvested parts. The most favored routes were dermal (33.33 %) and oral (29.25 %). About 87.07 % preparations were made from fresh plant materials. Breast cancer and skin cancer were treated with 14 % and 10.76 % of anticancer MPs, respectively. Conclusion. The review showed that anticancer MPs are widely used across the regions of Ethiopia. Most of the MPs are not scientifically experimented and yet are at a higher vulnerability to loss mainly by human activities. Calling for conservation measures, we recommend experimental validation of the frequently used anticancer MPs. This augments global anticancer drug researches.

AB  - Border regions face challenges managing natural resources, which include forests, wildlife, air, and rivers. This study aims to provide an overview of research on various natural resource conflicts and cooperation in borderlands worldwide, considering the five spheres of the Earth system, namely the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The type, scope, and place of natural resource conflicts in the borderlands were examined and key findings for clarifying the conflicts, cooperation, and geographical characteristics were derived using a systematic review methodology. The results indicate that over the last two decades, the conflicts over the hydrosphere are the most dominant. In the following order, conflicts over the biosphere have been frequently dealt with in transboundary areas. In Africa, dams (the anthroposphere) related to the hydrosphere especially influence and cause conflicts as well as cooperation for benefit-sharing among riparian countries. In North America, governance along the transboundary areas has been developed. "In Asia, several neighboring countries are linked through various types of associations ranging from multilateral organizations to sub-national administrations in order to effectively manage the long and wide-ranging natural resources that exist beyond the borders of the countries". In Europe, numerous protected areas related to the biosphere have been designated. Therefore, this research helps better understand transboundary conflicts based on natural resources and could contribute to designing natural resource management strategies or models in borderlands.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to identify the current state of the art and the gaps in the application of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models on studying climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review is conducted to select, classify and analyze relevant studies from two databases of Web of Science and Scopus.Findings - Totally, 170 articles based on selected keywords were found from both databases, where 56 articles were duplicates. The authors further excluded 17 articles owing to preliminary exclusion criteria. Hence, 97 papers were selected for full-text review and more detailed assessment. Only a few of the studies explicitly have addressed the role of autonomous adaptation embodied in the CGE models. Over one-third of the studies have focused on planned adaptation without explicitly mentioning autonomous adaptation. Agriculture was the most addressed sector, and country-level models are the most adopted. Only one article has focused on South America.Research limitations/implications - The review suggests that autonomous adaptation embodied in CGE models was not well addressed in the literature. As the limited studies have shown that autonomous adaptation can dramatically mitigate direct climate change impacts, further studies are needed to examine the importance of the autonomous adaptation for better understanding of climate change impacts. Furthermore, CGE models can provide a joint assessment considering both mitigation and adaptation strategies and management measures as such models have also been widely used to address effects of mitigation measures in the literature.Originality/value - The studies on climate change adaptation based on CGE models have been systematically reviewed, and state-of-the-art knowledge and research gaps have been identified.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of innovative projects funded by EU Rural Development Programs that were designed and implemented in rural areas of the European Union to facilitate the territorialized production of foodstuffs and their sale through alternative networks. On the basis of the results obtained in this review, we designed a model for the transfer of knowledge to the local community in the Alpujarra Granadina (Granada, Spain) within the framework of the LifeWatch project. This study uses two consecutive methodological approaches. We began by developing a protocol for the systematic search and analysis of successful rural development projects carried out in the European Union between 2007 and 2020. After that, we created a model for the transfer of results using a participative methodological approach. The results of our analysis of the group of projects selected for review show that the main innovations were made in different aspects of the product, process, sales and distribution. These innovative ideas were implemented by rural communities with a high degree of collective initiative and intelligence and could potentially be replicated in other areas. The sample analyzed contains a wide array of novel, alternative formulas, which are transversal to the projects, so provide significant contents that could be used to activate a space for participation and debate, which could itself become fertile ground for the creation of new projects. In conclusion, this study provides the stakeholders in rural areas, in particular farmers, with a wide, systematically organized knowledge base that proposes solutions to shared challenges.

AB  - The multi-level perspective (MLP) is a prominent transition framework. The MLP posits that transitions come about through interaction processes within and among three analytical levels: niches, socio-technical regimes and a socio-technical landscape. This systematic review provides an overview on the use of the MLP in research on agro-food sustainability transitions. In particular, it analyses the understanding, conceptualisation and operationalisation of niches, regimes and landscapes. Niches considered in the selected papers include agro-ecology, organic agriculture, permaculture, conservation agriculture, integrated farming, and alternative food networks. Regime refers to industrial, conventional agriculture. The researched regime is often not clearly described and its operationalisation is a matter of deliberation. Landscape level is generally overlooked; when it is considered it refers to international trends and developments. Many scholars highlight the inadequacy of transition pathways in the MLP for the agro-food sector. Moreover, transition impacts are rarely addressed and the research field generally overlooks the analysis of the sustainability of niches and, consequently, of transitions. Research on transitions in the agro-food sector borrows from the MLP its generalizability and poor empirical operationalisation of niche, regime and landscape concepts. Therefore, integrative conceptualisation and operationalisation of the MLP elements is required to accommodate the complexity of sustainability transition processes and the peculiarities of the agro-food system.

AB  - In Bangladesh, fishing communities are one of the most climate-vulnerable groups, though they play an important role in economic development. The main objective of this study was to identify vulnerability by exploring exposure (i.e., lack of regulating services or household capitals), susceptibility (i.e., lack of access to provisioning services), and lack of resilience (i.e., lack of alternative livelihoods and capacity) and to explore adaptation options, and challenges to understand risk governance. The study considered 45 published research articles for analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Keywords were used in combinations (e.g., fishing communities and Bangladesh) to identify and screen published articles. Articles published in English focusing on vulnerability and/or risk governance, published between 2011 and 2022, featuring original empirical data or a comprehensive systematic review, and published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Articles were excluded if vulnerability and risk governance were evaluated but did not fit or match the definition used in this study. The study found frequent disasters and ocean warming caused different stresses, such as reduced fish catch and income, and resulted in an increased risk of fisheries conflict. Moreover, fishing communities have limited access to properties, modern fishing equipment, financial institutions, and fisher-centered organizations. Adaptation strategies include ecosystem-based (e.g., plantation, payment for ecosystem services) and non-ecosystem-based (e.g., temporary migration, getting help from neighbors) approaches. To boost fish production, the Government of Bangladesh instituted fishing restrictions and social safety net programs (e.g., distributing rice during the fishing restrictions); both initiatives were helpful. However, the conservation policies are not being implemented properly, and there is no particular social welfare, such as banking systems, and low- or no-interest loans being provided that may support fishers to buy fishing equipment or generate alternative income sources. Considering the previous evidence of risks, this paper recommends that fisheries conservation policies be implemented properly, and fishing communities be provided with insurance services and no- or low-interest loans. This will contribute to reducing the climate-induced social-ecological risk and improve sustainable livelihoods that can withstand any regional, national, or local crisis.

AB  - The environmental movement of the 20(th) century has evolved into a large, diverse and well-financed global community that is increasingly required to prove its worth. Though the environmental sector collects and uses data to determine the status of ecological and social systems, the effectiveness of the programs and policies it uses to affect this status remains largely untested. As governments and donor institutions insist on greater transparency, accountability and evidence of what works and what does not, much is being learned from other fields (e.g. health services, education, international development) and increasingly sophisticated approaches are emerging to manage effectiveness. For example, program evaluation, adaptive management, and systematic review provide frameworks and methods to collect and use information to measure and improve performance. However, the critical data and collaborations necessary for an effectiveness revolution are marginalized by technical, cultural and political obstacles. Learning from other fields, the environmental sector must exploit key leverage points, such as flows of information and self-organization, to overcome impediments and create incentives to initiate and realize an era of effectiveness in environmental management.

AB  - The strategy of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration identifies three pathways for action for overcoming six global barriers thought to hamper upscaling. We evaluated 6,023 peer-reviewed and gray literature papers published over the last two decades to map the information landscape underlying the barriers and associated pathways for action across world regions, terrestrial ecosystem types, restorative interventions and their outcomes. Overall, the literature addressed more the financial and legislative barriers than the technical and research-related ones, supporting the view that social, economic and political factors hamper scaling up ecosystem restoration. Latin America, Africa, and North America were the most prominent regions in the literature, yet differed in the number of publications addressing each barrier. An overwhelming number of publications focused on forests (78%), while grasslands (6%), drylands (3%), and mangroves (2%) received less attention. Across the three pathways for action, the action lines on (1) promoting long-term ecosystem restoration actions and monitoring and (2) education on restoration were the most underrepresented in the literature. In general, restorative interventions assessed rendered positive outcomes except those of a political, legislative or financial nature which reported negative or inconclusive outcomes. Our indicative assessment reveals critical information gaps on barriers, pathways, and types of restorative interventions across world regions, particularly related to specific social issues such as education for ecosystem restoration. Finally, we call for refining "strength of evidence" assessment frameworks that can systematically appraise, synthesize and integrate information on traditional and practitioner knowledge as two essential components for improving decision-making in ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Demographic change is supposed to be the most important indirect driver for changing biodiversity. In this article, a systematic review of 148 studies was conducted to examine the scientific evidence for this relationship and to identify potential gaps in research. We explored the spatial distribution of studies, the categories addressed with respect to biodiversity and demographic change, and the ways in which their relationships were conceptualised (spatially and temporally) and valued. The majority of studies were carried out in Africa, Europe and North America. Our analysis confirms the trend that demographic phenomena were mostly found to negatively influence biodiversity. However, a considerable number of studies also point towards impacts that were context dependent, either positive or negative under certain circumstances. In addition to that we identified significant gaps in research. In particular, there is a lack of addressing (1) other demographic aspects such as population decline, age structure or gender differences, (2) spatial variability of, e.g. human population growth, (3) long-term effects of demographic processes, and (4) the context dependency (e.g. regulations/law enforcement, type of human activities, and choice of scale or proxy). We conclude there is evidence that the relationship between biodiversity and demographic change is much more complex than expected and so far represented in research. Thus, we call for a social-ecological biodiversity research that particularly focusses on the functional relation between biodiversity and human activities, namely the different types, context, and interdependent dynamics (spatial and temporal) of this complex relation.

AB  - Vision is important for safe driving, but there is limited understanding regarding the impact of vision disorders on driving ability and safety. This systematic review evaluated and summarized evidence on the impact of vision disorders and impairment on motor vehicle crash (MVC) risk and on-road driving performance across seven databases, was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020180135), and study quality rated using a standard tool. Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria for MVC risk (N = 36), on-road performance (N = 9), and both MVC risk and on-road performance (N = 3). Of these studies, less than half were rated as 'good' quality. Due to the small number of studies and often conflicting findings, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions for most vision disorders. However, evidence from several 'good' and 'fair' quality studies suggested increased MVC risk with binocular visual field impairment. There was mixed evidence regarding the impact of cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and homonymous field loss on MVC risk and no evidence of increased MVC risk with mild VA impairment. This review highlights the need for well-designed future studies to further explore the impact of vision disorders and impairment on driving outcomes to inform evidence-based policy and fitness to drive guidelines.

AB  - Purpose With interest in modern construction methods and new technologies on the rise, construction companies globally are increasingly looking at how to embrace new ideas and engage with new approaches to do things better. A significant amount of work has been carried out investigating the use of individual technologies in the construction sector. However, there is no holistic understanding of the new and emerging technologies that have had proven benefits for construction projects. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a landscape of technologies that have been implemented in the construction industry and the benefits associated with their implementation. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review approach and PRISMA guidelines were used. A total of 175 articles published between 2001 and 2020 were identified and thoroughly reviewed. Findings The results show that a total of 26 technologies were identified from the literature, and these can be categorised into five groups in terms of their functionality in construction process, namely: (1) data acquisition, (2) analytics, (3) visualisation, (4) communication and (5) design and construction automation. Digital technologies, especially for data acquisition and visualisation, generally appear to underpin and enable innovation in many aspects of construction. Improvements in work efficiency, health and safety, productivity, quality and sustainability have been cited as being the primary benefits of using these technologies. Of these, building information modelling (BIM) appears to be the single most commonly used technology thus far. With the development of computer technology, BIM has constantly been used in combination with other technologies/tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles/systems (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/UAS), geographic information systems (GIS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multidimensional modelling to realise a specifically defined benefit. Practical implications The findings from this review would help construction practitioners identify the types of technologies that can be implemented in different stages of construction projects to achieve desired outcomes, and thus, make appropriate decisions on technology investment and adoption. This review also suggests that to reap the full potential that these technologies offer, aside from construction companies changing their culture and business models, corresponding changes in the construction sector's operating systems related to building regulation, education and training, as well as contracting and procurement are required. Originality/value This paper undertakes a comprehensive systematic review of studies on technology implementation in the construction sector published between 2001 and 2020. It is the first attempt internationally to provide a holistic picture of technologies that have been studied and implemented in construction projects.

AB  - Advancement in packaging technology has played an essential role in reducing food waste and losses; however, most of this technology relies mostly on the use of plastics. Thus, there is an imminent need to think seriously about the transition towards a circular bioeconomy of innovative biobased materials with biodegradability potentials. This paper examines the driving forces behind the changes in food plastic packaging regimes and specifically seeks to understand how socio-technical configurations may influence niches to transition to a circular bioeconomy, particularly biobased biodegradable plastic materials. By employing a systematic review of the literature, we find that coordination with other back-end socio-technical systems that provide valorization of packaging waste is crucial to enable the transition. The literature indicates that one possible transition path is that the biobased biodegradable materials serve as "carriers of food waste". The paper contributes to the discussion on the dynamics of food packaging in the transition to a bioeconomy viewed through the lenses of a socio-technical system (niche-regime-landscape), which continues to reinforce future actions, leading to better management of packaging end-of-life.

AB  - Smart cities are widely seen as localities that actively embrace new technologies to achieve desired urban outcomes. Despite sustainability often claimed to be a desired outcome of smart city initiatives, little evidence exists how sustainability outcomes are incorporated or achieved within the smart city initiatives. This paper aims to address the question of whether cities can become smart without actually being sustainable. The study undertakes a systematic review of the smart and sustainable cities literature. The analysis highlights an expectation in the reviewed academic literature for cities to become sustainable first in order to be considered truly smart. The results point to major challenges of smart cities in delivering sustainable outcomes: (a) Smart city policies are characterised by heavy technocentricity; (b) Smart city practices involve complexities, and; (c) Smart city notions are conceptualised in an ad-hoc manner. The findings provide evidence that the current smart city practice fails to incorporate an overarching sustainability goal that is progressive and genuine. This, then, highlights the need for a post-anthropocentric approach in practice and policymaking for the development of truly smart and sustainable cities. The findings seek to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on this topic.

AB  - In the Searching for competitiveness in the market, the organization needs to be aimed at qualifying its practices to monitor its performance. Regardless of the size of the company, performance evaluation requires a continuous process. For this, it is necessary to develop indicators for performance evaluation. By this way, this research aimed to analyze how performance indicators are used in the form of management accounting artifacts by companies in the 21st century. With a qualitative approach, for this systematic research we used the SCOPUS database to list scientific articles published between the years 2001 to 2021, linked to the area of business studies, management and accounting, published in Brazil. Data were analyzed using Bardin's (2006) content analysis. This methodological path allowed us to show that the use of indicators subsidize decision-making, in the execution of control and in the preparation of managerial information in order to guide managers in the fulfillment of different organizational functions. In addition, the results suggest that performance indicators are used by companies in the 21st century as a performance measurement system that is linked to the organization's objectives, strategies and goals. However, the results highlight the importance of the managers' tacit and technical knowledge about the indicators so that the decision-making can be correct and determinant of the organization's rise.

AB  - Increasing pressure for food security and environmental sustainability has highlighted the need to switch from conventional agricultural methods to advanced agricultural practices. Digital agricultural technologies are considered promising solutions for sustainable intensification of food production and environmental protection. Despite significant promotional efforts initiated in recent years in China, the adoption rate remains low. The objective of this study is to gain insight into the factors affecting the adoption of on-farm digital technologies in China using a systematic review approach that analyzes 10 relevant studies. Data regarding methodological aspects and results are extracted. We identify 19 key adoption drivers that are related to socioeconomic, agroecological, technological, institutional, psychological, and behavioral factors. There is a predominance of ex-ante studies that use stated preference methods. We conclude with a discussion of the design of policy incentives to induce the adoption of digital technologies. Additionally, the review points to the limitations of existing research and suggests approaches that can be adopted for future investigations. This review provides meaningful implications for the development of future efforts to promote digital transformation for sustainable agriculture in China.

AB  - Purpose A substantial, albeit scattered, body of research evidence is accumulating in the cause-related marketing (CRM) research stream. Thus, there is a need of a systematic overview of extant literature to map and holistically understand the CRM domain. Design/methodology/approach To address this issue and make progress in this important area, the authors systematically review and critically examine the state of academic research on CRM. Findings Based on a systematic review of 105 journal articles published over the past 30 years, the results reveal that CRM research is a vibrant and rapidly growing domain in the broader marketing field. This assessment exercise also shows that the current state of knowledge about CRM is characterized by persisting knowledge gaps, conflicting empirical results, theoretical inconsistencies, as well as by the absence of international marketing research on the CRM domain. Originality/value Therefore, the authors critically evaluate the extant CRM research with the aim of increasing its coherence, quality, scope, impact and international dimension. Based on this evaluation, the authors develop an ambitious research agenda that addresses a number of promising research paths embracing different international perspectives. Finally, the authors discuss the contributions to the literature and the implications for both academics and practitioners.

AB  - The service sector has been gaining more space and consolidating in the market, being currently the great employer of labor in the world. This scenario intensifies the debate on the various aspects that can result from a structured management oriented to the sector: to improve the economy, productivity, competitiveness, sustainability and sector of goods and manufacture. In addition, the goods industry has been incorporating services associated with its products as a strategy of differentiation. Thus, to integrate manufactured goods and the services in a single value package for customers is strengthened. This work is to preliminarily review the development of integrated products and services, in order to obtain an overview of the subject, as well as to analyze possible implications and contributions between the themes. For this, a systematic review of the literature was carried out, in order to determine the main papers using the inductive method for reading, to identify the main elements of the articles and their contributions. Bibliometric indicators were constructed as main journals and number of articles published per year, as well as general results, in which it was possible to observe the orientations and correlated areas. Finally, the results made it possible to highlight the trend in the researched area, emphasizing the evolution of the theme over the years and its main contributions.

AB  - While overtourism is a relatively recent term, it has nevertheless triggered a large number of publications because of its human, environmental and social challenges. This systematic review therefore aims to take stock of the literature on overtourism. A lexicometric analysis based on 236 articles reveals that research on overtourism is highly concentrated and articulated around three main themes: the management, the experience, and the context of overtourism. The findings also suggest that academic research has so far focused on the negative impacts of overtourism. Subsequently, this study is calling for an ambidextrous approach, taking into account both the negative effects of overtourism, while also considering it as an opportunity in addressing the problem.

AB  - China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is one of the world's largest infrastructure projects, with its potential political and economic impact being widely discussed since its inception in 2013. Yet the phenomenon has received only limited attention in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) literature. In response, we first conduct a broad systematic review of the literature to assess how China's BRI is portrayed. Using this as a backdrop, we then distil the likely impact of the BRI on location decisions and supply chain flows. Finally, in a broader discussion of the SCM literature, we explore the implications of the BRI for future research in four key areas: supply chain configuration, supply chain resilience, sustainable SCM, and cross border SCM. While these areas are not new, the BRI presents a unique context that can be used to enhance theory and understanding in each area. The BRI reduces time distance independent of geographical distance by diverting supply chain flows from established routes to new routes via far less accessible regions. This introduces new risks and sustainability issues that call for multi-criteria decision support systems. Another important issue is the adoption and diffusion of the BRI since this will ultimately determine project success.

AB  - Unexceptionally all metropolitan areas throughout the world are surrounded by peri-urban areas that are neither urban nor rural in the conventional sense. Peri-urban areas are transition spaces, where the changes in different land uses are incessantly occurring. Determining the boundaries of these areas are critical to develop appropriate policies to manage and preserve them. The perpetual transition in peri-urban landscapes makes the boundary demarcation of these areas highly difficult. This paper aims to answer the question of what the most suitable methodological approach to demarcate peri-urban areas is. In order to address this question, the study undertakes a systematic review of the relevant literature. The findings show that a generic method does not exist to demarcate peri-urban areas as characteristics of peri-urban areas are not uniform across the globe. This paper advocates that techniques for peri-urban demarcation should be geographically specific, and in every case the regional and local contexts-e.g., political system, institutional arrangement, societal characteristic, environmental qualifies, and economic drivers that underpin the peri-urban development-should be considered. The study provides insights to policymakers in order to determine peri-urban boundaries by tailoring available periurban demarcation techniques to their regional and local contexts.

AB  - Reintroduction of beaver (Castor spp) may facilitate rehabilitation of freshwater habitats providing a cost-effective sustainable means of improving ecological conditions. Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat.

AB  - Background
   Both the World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that malnutrition will be the greatest contributor to climate change-associated morbidity and mortality. Although there have been several studies that have examined the potential effects of climate change on human health broadly, the effects on malnutrition are still not well understood. We conducted a systematic review investigating the role of three climate change proxies (droughts, floods, and climate variability) on malnutrition in children and adults.
   Methods and findings
   We identified 22 studies examining the effects of droughts, floods, and climate variability on at least one malnutrition metric. We found that 17 out of 22 studies reported a significant relationship between climate change proxies and at least one malnutrition metric. In meta-analysis, drought conditions were significantly associated with both wasting (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05-2.04) and underweight prevalence (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11).
   Conclusions
   Given the long-term consequences of malnutrition on individuals and society, adoption of climate change adaptation strategies such as sustainable agriculture and water irrigation practices, as well as improving nutritional interventions aimed at children aged 1-2 years and older adults, should be prioritised on global policy agendas in the coming years.

AB  - Integrated and transdisciplinary approaches are necessary in hotspots research where the intention is to influence policy and practice. Knowing that climate change will impact major ecosystem services and the sustainability of life support systems, a critical examination of the hotspot concept and approach is undertaken to pursue synergistic responses. Hotspots 2.0 embodies current thinking about planning towards multiple drivers of change and seeing human and natural systems as mutually inter-dependent and benefiting from integrated policy approaches. Such proposed adaptation interventions to inter-related stressors will complement biodiversity conservation, disaster risk reduction, and human well-being. Through a systematic review, we assess 114 relevant peer review cases to examine integrative responses to climatic and non-climatic vulnerabilities in various hotspot regions. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of the Hotspots 2.0 approach using emerging insights from the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia' in semi-arid regions, deltas, and glacier-fed river basin hotspots.

AB  - The move towards greener operations and products has forced companies to seek alternatives to balance efficiency gains and environmental friendliness in their operations and products. The exploration of the sequential or simultaneous deployment of lean and green initiatives is the results of this balancing action. However, the lean-green topic is relatively new, and it lacks of a clear and structured research definition. Thus, this paper's main contribution is the offering of a systematic review of the existing literature on lean and green, aimed at providing guidance on the topic, uncovering gaps and inconsistencies in the literature, and finding new paths for research. The paper identifies and structures, through a concept map, six main research streams that comprise both conceptual and empirical research conducted within the context of various organisational functions and industrial sectors. Important issues for future research are then suggested in the form of research questions. The paper's aim is to also contribute by stimulating scholars to further study this area in depth, which will lead to a better understanding of the compatibility and impact on organisational performance of lean and green initiatives. It also holds important implications for industrialists, who can develop a deeper and richer knowledge on lean and green to help them formulate more effective strategies for their deployment.

AB  - Continued declines in North American bat populations can be largely attributed to habitat loss, disease, and wind turbines. These declines can be partially mitigated through actions that boost reproductive success; therefore, management aimed at promoting availability of high-quality roosting habitat is an important conservation goal. Following the principles of the umbrella species concept, if co-occurring species share similar roost-tree preferences, then management practices targeting one species may confer conservation benefits to another. We conducted a systematic review of roost-site characteristics of thirteen species inhabiting eastern temperate forests to: (1) synthesize existing knowledge across species; (2) assess niche overlap among co-occurring species; and (3) evaluate the potential for currently protected species to serve as conservation umbrellas. We performed multivariate ordination techniques to group species based on the seven most-reported roost-site characteristics, including tree species, diameter at breast height, tree health, roost type, tree height, canopy closure, and roost height. Species sorted into three roosting guilds: (1) southern wetland inhabitants; (2) foliage specialists; and (3) dead tree generalists. Myotis septentrionalis and Perimyotis subflavus had significant roost-niche overlap with five and four other species respectively, and their existing protections make them suitable umbrellas for other bats in the North American eastern temperate forests.

AB  - The term 'biocultural' brings together the words 'biological' and 'cultural' to emphasize the interconnected nature of life and human culture. Over the last 50 years, biological and cultural diversity have shown concomitant declines in abundance, leading researchers, policy makers, activists and Indigenous Peoples to increasingly turn towards biocultural theory for potential pathways forward. Amidst increasing conversations and uses of the term 'biocultural', we sought to interrogate the current state of knowledge within biocultural theory and to identify the various ways the term 'biocultural' is being applied in the academic literature on conservation. To explore this research question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature that has meaningfully engaged with biocultural theory between 2002 and 2019 to explore the most concrete and promising pathways forward for effective and ethical on-the-ground implementation. After tracing key defini-tions and the evolution of the term over time, we find that the word 'biocultural' is most commonly being applied in the realms of biocultural diversity, biocultural heritage, and biocultural approaches. After offering an over-view of each of these areas, we conclude with three central findings. Firstly, we find that biocultural theory remains deeply rooted in seminal discussions around biocultural diversity. It is from this foundation that new areas of research and application have emerged in the last decade, including biocultural heritage, biocultural approaches to conservation, biocultural landscape and biocultural rights, amongst others. Secondly, biocultural theory retains strong roots in Indigenous rights and advocacy, which were originally articulated in the Decla-ration of Belem (1988) and continue to be evidenced by the large percentage of papers in our sample which focused on Indigenous perspectives related to biocultural diversity. Finally, we find that biocultural theory re-mains largely conceptual in nature, with indications that only in recent years have more applied, on-the-ground case studies started to emerge in the literature.

AB  - Palms (Arecaceae) exert great relevance to the structure and functioning of tropical forest ecosystems, in addition to comprise key resources for frugivorous animals. However, many species are currently at risk of extinction due to overexploitation and/or habitat loss. Our study aimed to perform a systematic review with a scientometric approach of all 78 native palm species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, seeking to identify the best-studied species and regions, main studied topics, overall patterns, trends and gaps in scientific research associated with this botany family. In total, studies were carried out for 48 species belonging to 10 genera, with the number of studies exponentially increasing from the 70s and exhibiting great difference in the number of publications among species. Euterpe edulis was the most studied species (n = 274), followed by Acrocomia aculeata (n = 205), whereas Bactris bahiensis (1), Geonoma litoralis (1), Syagrus santosii (1) and Trithrinax acanthocoma (0) comprised the less studied species. The largest number of studies was carried out in the south-eastern states of Brazil. Regarding the type of studies, 34% and 27% were related to biochemical properties and ecological processes, respectively, while studies on entomology (n = 26), tissue culture (n = 23) and taxonomy (n = 7) showed the lowest number of studies. Given the key role of palms in tropical forests, our study suggests that future research should focus on less studied species, including Desmoncus spp., Geonoma spp. and Trithrinax sp., and on some less studied areas like the north-east portion of the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Sustainable water resources management assessment frameworks (SWRM-AF) with associated indicators and benchmarks have appeared widely during the last decades to improve or maintain water resources. Examination or evaluation of their appropriateness and refinement for particular arid and semi-arid regions is a relatively unexplored area. To fill this gap in knowledge, a systematic review of relevant 21st century studies identified within two extensive databases, Scopus and Engineering Village, and in grey literature, is undertaken in this study. Therein, 17 studies are identified and thoroughly explored to identify their focus, application, and framework construction. The results of the comparative analysis among these frameworks show that the average numbers of components and indicators are 4.5 and 17.6, respectively. Meanwhile, categorical rescaling (47.1%), equal weighting (47.1%), arithmetic technique (82.35%), local scale (52.8%), and interval of the final index value of [0-100] (41.2%) are the most commonly used normalization methods and elements. The paper concludes that none of the existing tools reviewed is 100% applicable for arid and semi-arid regions, and therefore the case is made for developing a new bespoke SWRM-AF. The outcomes of this paper provide some useful insights into what should be included therein (e.g., stakeholder engagement and specific indicators to fit the context).

AB  - The growth of energy consumption demands a large expansion of transmission line (TL) networks worldwide. The reduction of the environmental impacts of these infrastructures will depend on the effectiveness of environmental impact assessments, that ultimately depend on the quality of the screening phase, the scoping phase, and the prioritization of potential environmental consequences. We conducted the first systematic review that encompasses all known potential impacts on biodiversity of the installation and operation of energy TLs, documented in the scientific literature and in a sample of Environmental Impact Studies (EIS). We examined 206 articles and 19 EIS and identified 28 impacts that correspond to biotic outcomes at the individual, population and community levels. Although scientific interest on TL impact evaluation is increasing, most studies have been focused on vertebrate taxa, especially birds. There are few published studies concerning habitat loss and the responses of functional groups with lower mobility or sensitive to physical alterations, such as amphibians. Most impacts appear in early stages of a project, during n construction, but persist during operation. We summarized the biotic impacts in a framework that may guide the screening of relevant impacts to be included in the EIS and consequently improve the outcomes of the environmental licensing process of transmission line projects.

AB  - Aims This review aims to examine the prevalence estimate of low resilience among health care professionals and identify the factors affecting the prevalence. Background Health care professionals experience high levels of stress. Understanding the health care professionals' resilience may provide an insight into how they perform in a highly stressed environment. Evaluation A comprehensive search of 11 databases was conducted. Studies that provided prevalence rates for low resilience among health care professionals working in a health care setting were included. Meta-analyses, sensitivity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted. Key issues Among 27,720 studies, 41 studies (N = 17,073) across 16 countries were included. The prevalence of low resilience was 26% (95% CI: 20-32). Subgroup analyses indicated that types of resilience measures affect resilience prevalence significantly. A higher prevalence of low resilience was observed among allied health professions during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East. Conclusions This review indicated the prevalence of low resilience and type of resilience measurement instruments that affected the prevalence. Implications for nursing management This review provides a roadmap to design tailored, discipline-specific and sustainable resilience training for nurses. Nursing managers should monitor the working hours and workload of nursing staffing in order to provide a protective working environment. This is a systematic review, and the PROSPERO registration number is CRD42021235350.

AB  - Agriculture communities in the Himalayas are disproportionately vulnerable due to the emerging challenges from climatic and non-climatic stressors. In this study, we systematically review peer-reviewed literature focused on vulnerability assessment of agriculture communities (n = 26) in the five Himalayan countries (Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan). We examine the yearly distribution, geographical scale, methodological approach, stress in consideration, indicators used, and assessment communication methods of the reviewed papers. Our findings indicate that vulnerability assessment of agriculture communities in the Himalayas is a recent practice, as all of the reviewed articles were published after 2007. About 62% of the assessments were conducted at local (household, community, and village) level, and few assessments at sub-national (19%) and basin (12%) levels. Indicator-based methods using primary quantitative data were most common (54%). Further, 90% of the studies addressed vulnerability to a single stressor with 50% of papers dealing with the vulnerability of agriculture communities to climate change and/or climate variability. From the analysis of the literature, it was found that multi-level, multi-stress, and comprehensive socio-ecological assessments were seldom attempted. Mostly the studies were done in isolated pockets and failed to identify the patterns of vulnerability. We advocate that to holistically understand the vulnerability-creating and differentiating mechanisms in agriculture communities, vulnerability assessment should adopt a multi-level approach by integrating both social and ecological determinants, firstly to identify the hotspots of vulnerability and then to deeply understand the root causes in the identified hotspots through integrated analysis.

AB  - Innovation management (IM) for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region poses unique socio-economic challenges due to the multi-faceted nature of Arab and Islamic countries. Additionally, proposals for indigenous initiatives, sustainability transitions and outward-oriented strategies in economic reform plans of the GCC add further complexity to IM scholarship and practice with imperatives to harness the potentials of these strategic visions. Yet, there is an absence of a systematic review to scrutinize IM literature on the GCC region. This paper systematically reviews the IM literature whose subject involve the GCC countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The review scrutinizes theories, trends and targets in this literature, covers the period from 1980 to 2019, and involves 110 journal papers from high quality IM-related publication outlets. Using insights from the review, the paper develops theoretical foundations for creative complementarities, institutional-pumps and a ripple model of regional innovation. The review also details some methodological, theoretical, conceptual and topical directions for future regional IM research studies.

AB  - Background: Raised blood pressure is a serious risk factor for several non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Iran. In this study, we aimed to estimate the mean of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and subsequently, the prevalence of hypertension by sex, age, province, and year in Iran.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases through December 2017. We also used individual level data from eight national surveys, aggregated data from seven subnational population-based studies, and extracted data reported in 52 published studies. We used a two-stage model including Age-Spatio-Temporal and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to estimate mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and used a crosswalk model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension by sex, age, province, and year.
   Results: The number of hypertensive adults increased in Iran from 1.8 million (882 thousand in women) in 1990 to 13.6 million (7.2 million in women) in 2016. The national age-standardized prevalence of hypertension increased from 8.7% (7.8-9.7) to 28.8% (27.7-30.0) in women and from 8.0% (7.2-8.9) to 24.2% (23.1-25.3) in men from 1990 to 2016. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures show a similar increasing trend.
   Conclusion: During the past 27 years, we observed an increase in the age-standardized prevalence and mean levels of blood pressure. If the current trend in levels of blood pressure and prevalence of hypertension continue in the coming years, Iran will not achieve the sixth target of the Global Action Plan by 2020 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe conducted a quantitative review examining 298 articles to categorize the literature on nurse-plant interactions based on geographic region, mechanism of facilitation, ecological hypothesis and nurse life-form.
   ResultsA total of nine different nurse mechanisms were identified and two were classified as meta-mechanisms. We found that shrubs were the dominant nurse life-form (46% of total studies) and that studies of positive plant interactions were most frequent in areas of high abiotic stress. Nurse-plant studies were also distributed unevenly around the globe with nearly a quarter in the South American Andes and Spain. Studies testing the direct nurse-protege interactions were the most frequently performed, including the ecophysiological responses of protege species (32.2%). Research gaps identified in the nurse-plant literature included indirect interactions and seed trapping as well as the large-scale implications for landscape ecology and evolution.
   Main conclusionsNurse plants are often considered keystone species because they commonly structure plant communities. This is an important confirmatory finding in many respects, but it is also novel in that it challenges traditional plant ecology theory and has important implications for landscape-level dynamics over time. The categorization of mechanisms proposed provides a conceptual framework useful for organizing the research to date and can accelerate linkages with theory and application by identifying important connections. It is becoming increasingly apparent that future studies of the nurse-plant syndrome must decouple and consider multiple mechanisms of interaction to explain the processes that influence community structure, particularly in high-stress conditions, given a changing climate and potential shifts in biodiversity.

AB  - To address concerns about the negative impacts of food supply chains in forest regions, a growing number of companies have adopted policies to influence their suppliers' behaviors. With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)-certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies-most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.

AB  - Background/Aims: The data on the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are conflicting. The present systematic review was thus conducted to study the prevalence of HBV and HCV markers in patients with IBD. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of 3 databases was conducted from 2000 to April 2022 for studies evaluating the prevalence of HBV or HCV in patients with IBD. Pooled prevalence rates across studies were expressed with summative statistics. Results: A total of 34 studies were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibodies were 3.3% and 14.2%, respectively. In HBsAg positive IBD patients, hepatitis B e antigen positivity and detectable HBV DNA were seen in 15.3% and 61.0% of patients, respectively. Only 35.6% of the IBD patients had effective HBV vaccination. The pooled prevalence of anti-HCV and detectable HCV RNA were 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of markers of HBV infection was higher in Asian studies, while the prevalence of markers of HCV infection was higher in European studies. The prevalence of viral hepatitis markers was similar between IBD patients and the general population and that between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Conclusions: The prevalence of markers of viral hepatitis remains same as the general population with significant regional variations, although the quality of evidence remains low due to publication bias. Only a small proportion of IBD patients had an effective HBV vaccination, requiring improvement in screening and vaccination practices. (Intest Res, Published online )

AB  - Malnutrition remains a key development challenge in many developing countries. Diversified agriculture practice can play an important role in dealing with this challenge. This paper attempts to review the research done on Agriculture and nutrition and analyze its outcome on employment generation through a systematic review of the literature. The paper concludes that the first paper on this aspect was published in 1974, but very few papers were published in this area. Post the year 2000, and there was an increase in the number of papers published in this area. However, the number of publications in this area is still quite less, which calls for a focus on the research in this area. Several research patterns have evolved from issues like mortality, mother, breastfeeding, child population, and education and have turned to recent issues like sustainability, livelihood, food insecurity, and urban agriculture. This paper provides insights into the gaps in the field of agriculture relating nutrition and employment aspect and analysis of new frontiers for Agriculture, Employment, and Nutrition, enabling future research directions. The literature analysis shows that the linkage between agriculture, nutrition, and employment is a less explored area, and there is a need for further research in this area. Particularly, developing nations have much importance to agriculture and its role in improving nutrition and employment. Their research should explore this nexus for achieving the Sustainable development goals of "No Poverty" and Zero Hunger."

AB  - Empirical research on the views of municipal managers can provide insights into urban forest governance and decision-making. However, current research is fragmented across a diversity of case studies using a variety of methods. To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of empirical studies based on the views of municipal managers. We extracted information on the concerns, priorities, factors, and actors that influence municipal manager decision-making using a governance framework to extract ideas on the discourses, actors, rules, and resources that influence their decision-making. Out of > 1400 articles found in searches, only 60 were relevant empirical studies, with 32 of them based in the US. Most studies elicited views from managers using pre-determined surveys/questionnaires. This literature is focused heavily on themes of resources, such as budgets and personnel, as important influences in program performance and urban forest success. Themes related to coordination of actors, such as the coordination of departmental units, were also frequently mentioned but were not explicitly associated with program performance or urban forest success. Future research aimed at gaining insights on urban forest governance and decision-making from the perspective of municipal managers will benefit from distinguishing operational capacities (i.e., budgets, personnel) from management processes (i.e., coordination), and focus on how municipal managers understand, facilitate, and find support in management processes. This will reveal how they implement co-governance and collaborative decision-making. Future research could better extend the knowledge base of existing studies by establishing clear governance frameworks and methods based on the views of managers.

AB  - Anthropometric indicators in farmers, as important indices in designing agricultural tools and equipment, should be considered more than before. Therefore, anthropometric indicators in farmers were reviewed. In this study, all the articles including original research papers, review articles, and technical notes in the English language were studied without time limits and using the keywords of agriculture, farmer, and anthropometry from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Based on the results, anthropometric indicators differed among the farmers in different countries and even those in different regions of each country. The results of anthropometric data in farmers were not constant over time; therefore, it is necessary to periodically measure these indicators. Different anthropometric indicators should be considered based on the design of which agricultural hand tools or machines. Considering the high importance of farming in the economy of each country and the high risk of musculoskeletal disorders in these occupations, it is critical to pay attention to the principles of ergonomics in designing agricultural tools and equipment in order to prevent musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, the latest data on the anthropometry of each region in each country, which were done periodically, should be used in designing agricultural tools. However, due to the limited number of studies reviewed in this study, more works should be conducted in future.

AB  - Widespread adoption of green vehicles in urban logistics may contribute to the alleviation of problems such as environmental pollution, global warming, and oil dependency. However, the current adoption of green vehicles in the last mile logistics is relatively low despite many actions taken by public authorities to overcome the negative externalities of distributing goods in cities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers); (b) policy (55 papers); (c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption. The use of autonomous vehicles results the most promising and challenging solution for last-mile logistics.

AB  - The current climate emergency has already impacted life on Earth with increasingly extreme, prolonged, and frequent weather events. One of the most critical consequences is the progressive desertification of lands, leading to a scarcity of safe and sustainably sourced freshwater supplies. Water availability is entwined with regional economic and social benefits, as well as environmental and ecosystem security. Today, about 4.5 billion people have inadequate access to clean water, pushing to find alternative solutions for providing safe water to all. Localized atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) may represent an economical and efficient alternative, and some case studies already demonstrate its small-scale viability. Nonetheless, its large-scale applicability in urban en-vironments and its related impacts and barriers are significantly under-explored. This paper proposes a systematic review of the main AWH technologies from the literature. It evaluates their potential for application on building facade components by identifying the technology readiness level (TRL) and undertaking a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis. Results indicate that the currently available technologies, despite their infancy on the TRL scale, offer significant potential for application at the building scale. Future research should investigate the boundary conditions necessary for AWH technologies to work in urban environments to identify a roadmap for large-scale uptake from the construction industry.

AB  - Tropical dry forest (TDF) is globally one of the most threatened forest types. In the insular Caribbean, limited land area and high population pressure have resulted in the loss of over 60% of TDF, yet local people's reliance on these systems for ecosystem services is high. Given the sensitivity of TDF to shifts in precipitation regimes and the vulnerability of the Caribbean to climate change, this study examined what is currently known about the impacts of climate change on TDF in the region. A systematic review (n = 89) revealed that only two studies addressed the ecological response of TDF to climate change. Compared to the rapidly increasing knowledge of the effects of climate change on other Caribbean systems and on TDF in the wider neotropics, this paucity is alarming given the value of these forests. We stress the need for long-term monitoring of climate change responses of these critical ecosystems, including phenological and hotspot analyses as priorities.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide a number of life-sustaining services, from which benefits to humans can be derived. They are often inhabited by aquatic vegetation, such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes. Given their wide geographic distribution and coverage, there is need to prioritize conservation efforts. An understanding of the human importance of these ecosystems can help with that prioritization. Here, we summarize a literature review of ecosystem service valuation studies. We discuss (1) the degree to which current valuation information is sufficient to prioritize blue carbon habitat conservation and restoration, (2) the relevancy of available studies, and (3) what is missing from the literature that would be needed to effectively prioritize conservation. Given the recent focus on blue carbon ecosystems in the international conservation, there are a number of areas where research on blue forest ecosystem assessment and valuation could be improved, from enhancing available methodologies to increasing valuation of rarely studied ecosystem services and wider geographic coverage of valuation studies. This review highlights these gaps and calls for a focus on broadening the ecosystem services that are valued, the methods used, and increasing valuation in underrepresented regions.

AB  - Undernutrition and low dietary diversity remain big problems in many developing countries, A large proportion of the people affected are smallholder farmers. Hence, it is often assumed that further diversifying small-farm production would be a good strategy to improve nutrition, but the evidence is mixed. We systematically review studies that have analyzed associations between production diversity, dietary diversity, and nutrition in smallholder households and provide a meta-analysis of estimated effects. We identified 45 original studies reporting results from 26 countries and using various indicators of diets and nutrition. While in the majority of these studies positive results are highlighted, less than 20% of the studies report consistently positive and significant associations between production diversity and dietary diversity and/or nutrition. Around 60% report positive associations only for certain subsamples or indicators, the rest found no significant associations at all. The average marginal effect of production diversity on dietary diversity is positive but small. The mean effect of 0.062 implies that farms would have to produce 16 additional crop pr livestock species to increase dietary diversity by one food group. The mean effect is somewhat larger in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions, but even in Africa farms would have to produce around 9 additional species to increase dietary diversity by one food group. While results may look differently under very specific conditions, there is little evidence to support the assumption that increasing farm production diversity is a highly effective strategy to improve smallholder diets and nutrition in most or all situations.

AB  - Background
   Control operations targeting Animal African Trypanosomiasis and its primary vector, the tsetse, were covering approximately 128,000 km 2 of Africa in 2001, which is a mere 1.3% of the tsetse infested area. Although extensive trypanosomiasis and tsetse (T&T) control operations have been running since the beginning of the 20th century, Animal African Trypanosomiasis is still a major constraint of livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We performed a systematic review of the existing literature describing T&T control programmes conducted in a selection of five African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, between 1980 and 2015. Sixty-eight documents were eventually selected from those identified by the database search. This was supplemented with information gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve key informants recruited in the study countries and selected based on their experience and knowledge of T&T control. The combined information from these two sources was used to describe the inputs, processes and outcomes from 23 major T&T control programmes implemented in the study countries. Although there were some data gaps, involvement of the target communities and sustainability of the control activities were identified as the two main issues faced by these programmes. Further, there was a lack of evaluation of these control programmes, as well as a lack of a standardised methodology to conduct such evaluations.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Past experiences demonstrated that coordinated and sustained control activities require careful planning, and evidence of successes, failures and setbacks from past control programmes represent a mine of information. As there is a lack of evaluation of these programmes, these data have not been fully exploited for the design, analyses and justification of future control programmes.

AB  - Windstorm is one of the destructive natural disturbances, but the scale-link extent to which recurrent windstorms influenced forests ecosystems is poorly understood in a changing climate across regions. We reviewed the synergistic impacts of windstorms on forests and assessed research trends and methodological approaches from peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 in tropical (TRF), subtropical (SUF), and temperate (TEF) forests/zones, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, the majority of the reviewed studies were conducted in TRF (i.e., 40%), intermediate in SUF (i.e., 34%), and the lowest in TEF (i.e., 26%). Among the four levels of biological organization, the species-population and community-ecosystem levels had the highest number of study cases, while the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels had the lowest study cases in all forest types. Most of the articles reviewed dealt largely on tree mortality/survival and regeneration/succession for TRF, tree mortality/survival and species composition/richness/diversity for SUF, and stem density, gap dynamics, and regeneration/succession for TEF. However, research on the effects of windstorms on mycorrhizal symbioses, population genetics, and physiological adaptation, element fluxes via litterfall, litter decomposition, belowground processes, biological invasion, and tree health are less common in all forest types. Further, most of the studies were conducted in permanent plots but these studies mostly used observational design, while controlled studies are obviously limited. Consequently, more observational and controlled studies are needed on the topic reviewed, particularly studies at the molecular-cellular-individual and landscape levels, to help inform forest management decision-making about developing sustainable and resilient forests amid climate change.

AB  - In India, agriculture serves as the backbone of the economy, and is a primary source of employment. Despite the setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the agriculture and allied sectors in India exhibited resilience, registered a growth of 3.4% during 2020-2121, even as the overall economic growth declined by 7.2% during the same period. The improvement of the agriculture sector holds paramount importance in sustaining the increasing population and safeguarding food security. Consequently, researchers worldwide have been concentrating on digitally transforming agriculture by leveraging advanced technologies to establish smart, sustainable, and lucrative farming systems. The advancement in remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) has proven beneficial for farmers and policymakers in minimizing crop losses and optimizing resource utilization through valuable crop insights. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of studies dedicated to the application of RS and ML in addressing agriculture-related challenges in India. We conducted a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and evaluated research articles published from 2015 to 2022. The objective of this study is to shed light on the application of both RS and ML technique across key agricultural domains, encompassing "crop management", "soil management", and "water management, ultimately leading to their improvement. This study primarily focuses on assessing the current status of using intelligent geospatial data analytics in Indian agriculture. Majority of the studies were carried out in the crop management category, where the deployment of various RS sensors led yielded substantial improvements in agricultural monitoring. The integration of remote sensing technology and machine learning techniques can enable an intelligent approach to agricultural monitoring, thereby providing valuable recommendations and insights for effective agricultural management.

AB  - Context. There is rapidly increasing need for palliative care in Greater China because of rapidly aging populations.
   Objectives. This study aimed to systematically review and appraise evidence for palliative care needs, models of care, interventions, and outcomes in Greater China.
   Methods. Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were searched, with hand searching of local journals and databases. Narrative synthesis was applied to the qualitative and quantitative evidence.
   Results. Nineteen qualitative studies and 47 quantitative studies were retained. With respect to care needs, nine themes were synthesized: pain control, reduced aggressive end-of-life care, truth telling, physical, emotional, and spiritual supports, and achieving preferred place of care/death. Informal caregivers expressed their needs for education and burden reduction. Health care professionals called for training and national policy support. Twenty-four studies evaluated interventions, mostly among patients with advanced cancer. Positive effects were suggested for improvements in quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression, readmission rate, and costs. Models of care evaluated were mostly specialist palliative care delivered in various settings (hospitals, residential care, and home). Outcome measures used were grouped into six categories of construct: quality of life, pain, physical assessment, psychospiritual assessment, quality of care, and implementation assessment. Limited rigorous randomized controlled trials are available to document intervention outcomes, and some problems (such as high attrition rates) reduced the strength of the evidence.
   Conclusion. Palliative care services within Greater China should pay more attention to management of nonmalignant disease and to integration into primary services. Policy support is key to establishing culturally appropriate person-centered services. (C) 2020 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. It is predicted that conversion of land and habitats will increase rapidly over the next few decades in Africa. Over the years, these changes potentially reduced the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production for vertebrates. Ficus species (Moraceae), commonly known as figs, occupy diverse habitats and typically produce large numbers of nutritional fleshy fruits that are important to frugivores. However, a decline in Ficus spp. distribution because of land-use changes may negatively affect frugivores and their ecosystems (e.g. via seed dispersal). We systematically searched for studies on the distribution of Ficus spp. in Africa and their frugivore interactions together with the effects of land-use changes up until 2021. Our search resulted in 70 eligible papers. A total of 124 Ficus spp. were recorded across 30 African countries representing approximately 56% of the African countries. Cameroon had the highest record of 63 species, while Benin, Burundi, Ghana, and Rwanda had two, the least number of Ficus spp. recorded. East Africa had the highest Ficus spp. richness recorded (96 species), followed by southern Africa (74 species), Central and Northern Africa (72 species), and West Africa with the least (31 species) recorded. Information about the effect exerted by anthropogenic land-use changes on Ficus-frugivore interaction in Africa was limited. However, research has been conducted on the impact of anthropogenic land-use changes on plant-frugivore and frugivore feeding ecology. Ficus spp. fruit were identified as significant in the diets of various frugivores across Africa, as it is found globally. However, it is essential to understand the impacts of anthropogenic land-use changes on the mutual interaction between frugivores and Ficus spp. and the attendant consequences for ecosystem service provision.

AB  - The degradation of soil resources is accelerating owing to water erosion induced by detrimental land use/land cover (LULC) practices. Although the relationship between affecting factors associated with LULC and soil erosion has been well-documented, a systematic review of LULC for erosion control is lacking. A quantitative synthesis of 1270 runoff and 1302 sediment observations from 79 references covering 57 sites was conducted to assess the effects of LULC on erosion control in the red soil hilly region (RSHR) of southern China. The results indicated that the maximum runoff and soil loss were found in bare land (BL), but the minimum runoff and soil loss were detected in cropland and grassland, respectively. Among the 16 land use subtypes, BL left for natural succession had the highest runoff, but the lowest runoff was found in orchard with contact cover; the soil loss was largest for cropland without conservation measures, while the minimum value was detected in natural shrubland. When the vegetation coverage exceeded 60%, runoff and soil loss both tended to reach a stable rate. Land use with a multi-layer vegetation structure or ground/contact cover or broadleaf plant had less runoff and lower sediment values. In addition, soil loss decreased sharply during the initial 3 y of vegetation restoration, and then slowly declined until reaching a relatively stable rate after 15 y of succession. Our results confirmed that land use (except for BL) has a limited influence on soil erosion provided that suitable land cover is established. This study revealed that sustainable land management measures should be adopted based on local conditions to reduce soil erosion induced by irrational LULC. These findings can serve as a scientific basis for policy makers and land managers with respect to water erosion control in the RSHR.

AB  - For an agricultural firm (AF), being sustainable is a complex challenge that requires both a strategic vision and a transition to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
   In a high-risk scenario, the adoption of sustainable business models (SBMs) can generate significant effects on the AFs' economic performance. In particular, SBMs can stabilize production, reduce the default risk for AFs and, lastly, minimize the probability of credit rationing by the banking system.
   Firms' difficulty in accessing credit lines arises from the new supervisory banking rules aimed at stimulating banks to adopt credit disbursement and monitoring procedures, inspired by the principles of soundness and prudence.
   Contextually, a new form of credit known as "microfinancing" is emerging in the agricultural sector. It is characterized by short-term loans and low transaction costs and it is practiced by Micro-Finance Institutions.
   Through a bibliometric and systematic review of the literature, this study aims to map the state of knowledge on the lending strategies adopted for AFs, focusing on the sustainable development perspective. Specifically, two complementary analyses were conducted based on a database search that followed the systematic review protocol, with support from VOSviewer and R softwares. From the keyword co-occurrence analysis, it emerged that the most debated topics are related to the AFs' sustenance and are focused on developing countries. The findings highlight growing attention to the topic of sustainability in the 'access to credit' strategy for AFs, but also poor information about a potential indirect role that Political & Governmental Institutions can play in the spreading of sustainability practices in the agriculture sector.
   However, the literature is still mainly founded on the economic pillar of sustainability, focusing almost exclusively on the profile and performance potentials of AFs.
   In addition, there is scarce evidence of the impact that sustainable practices have on both profiling activities by financial intermediaries and the risk profiles of AFs. These topics could be explored in future research.
   Despite some limitations, the study illustrates the state of the art of the nexus between access to credit and sustainability in the agricultural sector, providing useful ideas to fill the gaps in the literature and discover future research trends.
   Lastly, the implications of this analysis could support researchers, policy makers, and managers to build suitable strategies for the whole agri-food supply chain, ensuring sector resilience.

AB  - Background The prevalence of inter-nurse lateral violence (LV) reported in current studies is inconsistent, ranging from 7% to 83%. The purpose of this study is to quantify the prevalence of LV in nurses' workplaces. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis. Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched for relevant studies (up to 27 January 2021). We included cross-sectional, case-control or cohort studies in which both abusers and victims were nurses. Studies that did not provide specific data on abusers were excluded. Stata V.16.0 was used for statistical analysis. Fixed-effect or random-effect model was adopted according to heterogeneity, which was evaluated by Cochran's Q and I-2 values. The main indicator was LV prevalence. Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Results A total of 14 studies with 6124 nurses were included. Further, 13 articles with 5745 nurses were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled prevalence of LV among nurses was 33.08% (95% CI: 23.41% to 42.75%, pI(2)=99.0%). The remaining one study containing 370 samples reported that the prevalence of inter-nurse LV was 7.92%. Subgroup analysis showed that region, sample size, sampling, study's quality, response rate and publication time might not be the sources of heterogeneity. Meta-regression indicated that sample size had the main influence on model heterogeneity. Egger's test showed the existence of publication bias (p=0.03). Discussion The prevalence of inter-nurse LV is high in nurse workplace. It is suggested that scholars pay more attention to the cultural differences of inter-nurse LV between regions in the future. This study has the following limitations: there is a lack of studies on LV prevalence in many countries; lack of standard assessment tools; no grey literature was searched.

AB  - Traditional agroecological knowledge (i.e. TAeK) is gaining recognition for its potential contribution to climate change adaptation in food systems, ecosystems restoration and food insecurity. Despite the existing literature on Traditional Ecological Knowledge and its nexus with food security, how gender critically influences the distribution of such knowledge within agri-food systems has not yet been systematically analysed. In this regard, this systematic review attempts to answer four questions: 1) How does the literature on gender and TAeK in agri-food systems evolved temporally, geographically and in different agroecosystems? 2) How are gender and intersectionality mainly approached by such literature? 3) How do the articles address gendered dimensions in TAeK within the agri-food system activities? 4) What are the main drivers of change that influence TAeK and adaptive responses? The results show the gendered nature of TAeK in relation to food production, processing, and conservation activities, and how these activities are linked to tasks and activities, gender-specific knowledge, and spaces where gender discrimination is reproduced. The review also identifies elements that delimit and/or take part of the development of TAeK, such as gendered access to resources, gendered institutions, and the identification of the main drivers of change and impacts of TAeK erosion and biodiversity loss. These results are discussed in terms of power relations that interact with sociocultural norms and practices according to the specific geographical context and agroecosystem.

TI  - How Does Medical Device Regulation Perform in the United States and the European Union? A Systematic Review
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - PREMARKET APPROVAL
KW  - RECALLS
KW  - FDA
AB  - Background: Policymakers and regulators in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) are weighing reforms to their medical device approval and post-market surveillance systems. Data may be available that identify strengths and weakness of the approaches to medical device regulation in these settings.
   Methods and Findings: We performed a systematic review to find empirical studies evaluating medical device regulation in the US or EU. We searched Medline using two nested categories that included medical devices and glossary terms attributable to the US Food and Drug Administration and the EU, following PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. We supplemented this search with a review of the US Government Accountability Office online database for reports on US Food and Drug Administration device regulation, consultations with local experts in the field, manual reference mining of selected articles, and Google searches using the same key terms used in the Medline search. We found studies of premarket evaluation and timing (n = 9), studies of device recalls (n = 8), and surveys of device manufacturers (n = 3). These studies provide evidence of quality problems in pre-market submissions in the US, provide conflicting views of device safety based largely on recall data, and relay perceptions of some industry leaders from self-surveys.
   Conclusions: Few studies have quantitatively assessed medical device regulation in either the US or EU. Existing studies of US and EU device approval and post-market evaluation performance suggest that policy reforms are necessary for both systems, including improving classification of devices in the US and promoting transparency and post-market oversight in the EU. Assessment of regulatory performance in both settings is limited by lack of data on post-approval safety outcomes. Changes to these device approval and post-marketing systems must be accompanied by ongoing research to ensure that there is better assessment of what works in either setting.

AB  - Background: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) arises as a consequence of a sudden period of food shortage and is associated with loss of a person's body fat and wasting of their skeletal muscle. Many of those affected are already undernourished and are often susceptible to disease. Infants and young children are the most vulnerable as they require extra nutrition for growth and development, have comparatively limited energy reserves and depend on others. Undernutrition can have drastic and wide-ranging consequences for the child's development and survival in the short and long term. Despite efforts made to treat SAM through different interventions and programmes, it continues to cause unacceptably high levels of mortality and morbidity. Uncertainty remains as to the most effective methods to treat severe acute malnutrition in young children.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to treat infants and children aged <5 years who have SAM.
   Data sources: Eight databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, CAB Abstracts Ovid, Bioline, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, EconLit EBSCO and The Cochrane Library) were searched to 2010. Bibliographies of included articles and grey literature sources were also searched. The project expert advisory group was asked to identify additional published and unpublished references.
   Review methods: Prior to the systematic review, a Delphi process involving international experts prioritised the research questions. Searches were conducted and two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full texts of retrieved papers by one reviewer and checked independently by a second. Included studies were mapped to the research questions. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Differences in opinion were resolved through discussion at each stage. Studies were synthesised through a narrative review with tabulation of the results.
   Results: A total of 8954 records were screened, 224 full-text articles were retrieved, and 74 articles (describing 68 studies) met the inclusion criteria and were mapped. No evidence focused on treatment of children with SAM who were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive, and no good-quality or adequately reported studies assessed treatments for SAM among infants <6 months old. One randomised controlled trial investigated fluid resuscitation solutions for shock, with none adequately treating shock. Children with acute diarrhoea benefited from the use of hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution (H-ORS) compared with the standard World Health Organization-oral rehydration solution (WHO-ORS). WHO-ORS was not significantly different from rehydration solution for malnutrition (ReSoMal), but the safety of ReSoMal was uncertain. A rice-based ORS was more beneficial than glucose-based ORSs, and provision of zinc plus a WHO-ORS had a favourable impact on diarrhoea and need for ORS. Comparisons of different diets in children with persistent diarrhoea produced conflicting findings. For treating infection, comparison of amoxicillin with ceftriaxone during inpatient therapy, and routine provision of antibiotics for 7 days versus no antibiotics during outpatient therapy of uncomplicated SAM, found that neither had a significant effect on recovery at the end of follow-up. No evidence mapped to the next three questions on factors that affect sustainability of programmes, long-term survival and readmission rates, the clinical effectiveness of management strategies for treating children with comorbidities such as tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori infection and the factors that limit the full implementation of treatment programmes. Comparison of treatment for SAM in different settings showed that children receiving inpatient care appear to do as well as those in ambulatory or home settings on anthropometric measures and response time to treatment. Longer-term follow-up showed limited differences between the different settings. The majority of evidence on methods for correcting micronutrient deficiencies considered zinc supplements; however, trials were heterogeneous and a firm conclusion about zinc was not reached. There was limited evidence on either supplementary potassium or nicotinic acid (each produced some benefits), and nucleotides (not associated with benefits). Evidence was identified for four of the five remaining questions, but not assessed because of resource limitation.
   Limitations: The systematic review focused on key questions prioritised through a Delphi study and, as a consequence, did not encompass all elements in the management of SAM. In focusing on evidence from controlled studies with the most rigorous designs that were published in the English language, the systematic review may have excluded other forms of evidence. The systematic review identified several limitations in the evidence base for assessing the effectiveness of interventions for treating young children with severe acute malnutrition, including a lack of studies assessing the different interventions; limited details of study methods used; short follow-up post intervention or discharge; and heterogeneity in participants, interventions, settings, and outcome measures affecting generalisability.
   Conclusions: For many of the most highly ranked questions evidence was lacking or inconclusive. More research is needed on a range of topic areas concerning the treatment of infants and children with SAM. Further research is required on most aspects of the management of SAM in children <5 years, including intravenous resuscitation regimens for shock, management of subgroups (e.g. infants <6 months old, infants and children with SAM who are human immunodeficiency virus sero-positive) and on the use of antibiotics.

AB  - Genome sequencing is a powerful tool that can inform the management of threatened species. Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are a globally recognized species that captured the hearts and minds of the world during the 2019/2020 Australian megafires. In 2022, koalas were listed as 'Endangered' in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. Populations have declined because of various threats such as land clearing, habitat fragmentation, and disease, all of which are exacerbated by climate change. Here, we present the Koala Genome Survey, an open data resource that was developed after the Australian megafires. A systematic review conducted in 2020 demonstrated that our understanding of genomic diversity within koala populations was scant, with only a handful of SNP studies conducted. Interrogating data showed that only 6 of 49 New South Wales areas of regional koala significance had meaningful genome-wide data, with only 7 locations in Queensland with SNP data and 4 locations in Victoria. In 2021, we launched the Koala Genome Survey to generate resequenced genomes across the Australian east coast. We have publicly released 430 koala genomes (average coverage: 32.25X, range: 11.3-66.8X) on the Amazon Web Services Open Data platform to accelerate research that can inform current and future conservation planning.

AB  - Research on the potential impact of interventions in agriculture on nutrition outcomes is of particular relevance in South Asia where agriculture-related activities are a major source of livelihoods for large sections of society and where the population suffers from one of the highest global burdens of malnutrition in all its forms. This systematic review aims to assess the strength of the available evidence that agricultural interventions have an impact on intermediate and final nutrition outcomes in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. We searched five literature databases and reference lists of previous systematic reviews to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2017, detailing impacts of household- or farm-level agricultural interventions on nutritional outcomes in South Asia. We identified six intervention studies (reported in nine papers) conducted in Bangladesh (two studies), India (two studies) and Nepal (two studies). The majority of studies examined the impact of provision of seed, plants and training to increase home garden fruit and vegetable production with or without integrated poultry provision and training. Other studies evaluated the impact of livestock or aquaculture provision and training. Study designs and quality were mixed; heterogeneity across studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Interventions had a positive impact on intermediate outcomes on the pathway from agricultural intervention to nutritional or health status including dietary quality and dietary diversity of households and individuals (reported in seven papers). The evidence on the impact on final nutritional outcomes was mixed: one paper reported that home gardens with poultry reduced the odds of anaemia but there was no convincing evidence of an impact of agricultural interventions on child anthropometric measurement (reported in four papers). In recent years, the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research programme consortium has significantly expanded research on agricultural interventions for nutrition outcomes by conducting and commissioning a suite of formative and feasibility studies that have extended both the range and geographic location of interventions under study. This expanding body of research should, in the future, enable the identification of cost-effective interventions to enhance the impact of agricultural interventions sustainably to improve nutrition outcomes especially in women and children in South Asia.

AB  - In recent years, the rise of e-commerce has prompted the emergence of electronic marketplaces, or e-marketplaces, which act as intermediaries in the buying and selling process, bringing together several vendors to offer a wide range of products and services to customers, generating modalities such as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-marketplaces. E-marketplaces offer advantages such as access to potential buyers, business and product visibility, the reduction of transaction costs, the comparison of offers and prices among competitors, and the ease of business internationalization. However, the success of e-marketplace business models depends on the sustainability of these platforms, which must involve different stakeholders in order to meet economic, environmental, and social objectives. Therefore, this study presents a bibliometric analysis and systematic review of e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability for the last ten, five, and two years. The analysis includes the number, types, and subject areas of documents published each year, as well as considerations such as the most-cited publications and the leading authors, journals, countries, and institutional affiliations. The analysis also includes a study of the relevant concepts in the publications and their relationships, identifying the predominant topics related to e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability. The results indicate a focus on subject areas such as social sciences, environmental sciences, energy, business, management, and accounting, which is consistent with the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. The findings show that e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability are closely related to concepts such as sustainable development, e-commerce, digital marketing, China (the leading country in terms of publications in all periods), logistics, supply chain management, big data, planning, and decision making. Future works should address traffic congestion and environmental impact, new delivery practices in last-mile logistics, and the motives for users' engagement in e-marketplaces. Likewise, future research can be oriented toward sustainability dimensions and stakeholders' integration through open innovation and toward the limitations of SMEs in order to access and benefit from digital platforms.

AB  - We develop and apply a systematic review methodology to identify and understand how the peer-reviewed literature characterises Indigenous peoples' involvement in marine governance and management approaches in terms of equity and justice worldwide. We reviewed the peer-reviewed English-language research articles between January 2015 and September 2020 for examples of Indigenous peoples' involvement in marine governance and management using the analytical lens of environmental justice. The majority of research studies highlighted that Indigenous peoples experienced some form of environmental injustice linked to existing marine governance and management, most notably in the context of inequitable decision-making procedures surrounding the establishment and operation of marine protected areas. However, there are significant gaps in the current literature, including a notable absence of studies exploring Indigenous women and other gender minorities' involvement in marine planning and management and the limited number of studies about Indigenous peoples living throughout Asia, the Arctic, Russia, and Africa. More studies are needed to explore collaborative and intersectional approaches, including co-governance and co-management and ecosystem-based management, and critically evaluate what constitutes inclusive, equitable, and just marine governance and management processes, practices, and outcomes for different Indigenous peoples occupying diverse social-ecological systems.

AB  - Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN's sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.

AB  - Sustainable management of coastal and inland water areas requires knowledge of how tourism and recreation affects the ecosystems. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify to what extent recreational boat traffic and infrastructure for mooring affect the abundance of submerged vegetation on soft bottoms. Our systematic search yielded 25 studies containing data on effects of boat traffic, docks and mooring buoys on vegetation abundance. The abundance below docks was on average 18% of that in controls, and areas with boat traffic had on average 42% of the abundance in control areas. Mooring buoys often created scour areas without vegetation. However, the effects were variable and there were too few studies to test the reasons for this variability. We conclude that boating can cause significant declines in submerged vegetation but that informed management of boat traffic and improved design of docks and buoys can reduce negative impacts.

AB  - Urban decision-makers typically cannot utilize empirical bird studies to create bird-friendly landscape designs because academic results are often in a format that is not easily transferable to planning. We report on the results of three systematic reviews of peer reviewed literature regarding bird occurrence in forests, forest fragments, and tree canopy in and around North American cities. Note that our reviews focused on occurrence and did not evaluate species fitness or abundance. We synthesized findings from 48 studies to create a list of 219 forest dwelling species; and for each species, we identified whether the species utilized or did not utilize forest fragments during the breeding season; whether migrant species utilized forest fragments as stopover sites during the migration season; and whether the species utilized residential areas with trees during the breeding and migration seasons. We found that some interior-forest specialists, which generally require large tracts of forest to breed successfully, use small urban and rural forest fragments as well as tree canopy within suburban residential areas as stopover sites during migration seasons. This supports previous literature findings that habitat requirements for migrants, including interior-forest specialists, may differ between breeding and migration seasons. The synthesized bird list will allow built environment professionals to identify bird species that can and cannot use treed habitat in fragmented rural and urban landscapes, and we have created a planning tool for conserving avian habitat.

AB  - Baiting is a powerful tool used to manipulate wildlife populations and induce ecosystem change. It involves delivering a substance to target individuals by deploying baits that they then consume. To identify patterns in bait applications and highlight opportunities for its improvement, we conducted a worldwide systematic review. Baiting occurred across 28 countries, but 60 % of all bait applications occurred in Australia or New Zealand. Baiting reports accelerated considerably in the early 2000's, driven by the use of sodium monofluoroacetate, which accounted for 42 % of all substances delivered in baits. For 89 % of bait applications their purpose was lethal control. Over 71 species were targeted in bait applications, including 62 mammals, eight birds and one reptile. Geographically, omnivores were the most widely baited guild, with carnivores being heavily targeted in Australia. Sixty-three percent of bait applications used simple designs that are known to frequently mis-represent the magnitude and direction of population impacts. The replication of impact and control sites was often very low. The distribution of baits occurred over areas as small as 100 m2 and as large as 4000 km2. Despite its overwhelming use for lethal control, baiting is not inherently detrimental to target individuals, and is also used to achieve therapeutic benefits. Baiting is an important tool that can be used to manipulate wildlife populations and induce ecosystem change; this power brings forth a responsibility to continually optimise its use and ensure its application is targeted. We highlight opportunities where the application of baiting may be expanded, and studies improved.

AB  - PURPOSEVulnerable populations face geographical barriers in accessing radiotherapy (RT) facilities, resulting in heterogeneity of care received and cancer burden faced. We aimed to explore the current use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in access to RT and use these findings to create sustainable solutions against barriers for access in low- and middle-income countries.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review using the PRISMA search strategy was done for studies using GIS to explore outcomes among patients with cancer. Included studies were reviewed and classified into three umbrella categories of how GIS has been used in studying access to RT.
   RESULTS Forty articles were included in the final review. Thirty-eight articles were set in high-income countries and two in upper-middle-income countries. Included studies were published from 2000 to 2020, and were comprised of patients with all-cancers combined, breast, colon, skin, lung, prostate, ovarian, and rectal carcinoma patients. Studies were categorized under three groups on the basis of how they used GIS in their analyses: to describe geographic access to RT, to associate geographic access to RT with outcomes, and for RT planning. Most studies fell under multiple categories.
   CONCLUSION Although this field is relative nascent, there is a wide array of functions possible through GIS for RT planning, including identifying high-risk populations, improving access in high-need areas, and providing valuable information for future resource allocation. GIS should be incorporated in future studies, especially set in low- and middle-income countries, which evaluate access to RT.

AB  - Introduction: The global spread and the increased frequency and magnitude of epidemic dengue in the last 50 years underscore the urgent need for effective tools for surveillance, prevention, and control. This review aims at providing a systematic overview of what predictors are critical and which spatial and spatio-temporal modeling approaches are useful in generating risk maps for dengue.
   Methods: A systematic search was undertaken, using the PubMed, Web of Science, WHOLIS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and OvidSP databases for published citations, without language or time restrictions. A manual search of the titles and abstracts was carried out using predefined criteria, notably the inclusion of dengue cases. Data were extracted for pre-identified variables, including the type of predictors and the type of modeling approach used for risk mapping.
   Results: A wide variety of both predictors and modeling approaches was used to create dengue risk maps. No specific patterns could be identified in the combination of predictors or models across studies. The most important and commonly used predictors for the category of demographic and socio-economic variables were age, gender, education, housing conditions and level of income. Among environmental variables, precipitation and air temperature were often significant predictors. Remote sensing provided a source of varied land cover data that could act as a proxy for other predictor categories. Descriptive maps showing dengue case hotspots were useful for identifying high-risk areas. Predictive maps based on more complex methodology facilitated advanced data analysis and visualization, but their applicability in public health contexts remains to be established.
   Conclusions: The majority of available dengue risk maps was descriptive and based on retrospective data. Availability of resources, feasibility of acquisition, quality of data, alongside available technical expertise, determines the accuracy of dengue risk maps and their applicability to the field of public health. A large number of unknowns, including effective entomological predictors, genetic diversity of circulating viruses, population serological profile, and human mobility, continue to pose challenges and to limit the ability to produce accurate and effective risk maps, and fail to support the development of early warning systems.

AB  - Purpose Maintenance is a critical business function with a great impact on economic, environmental and social aspects. However, maintenance decisions' planning has been driven by merely economic and technical measures with inadequate consideration of environmental and social dimensions. This paper presents a review of the literature pertaining to sustainable maintenance decision-making models supported by a bibliometric analysis that seeks to establish the evolution of this research over time and identify the main research clusters. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review, supported with a bibliometric and network analysis, of the extant studies is conducted. The relevant literature is categorized based on which sustainability pillar, or possibly multiple ones, is being considered with further classification outlining the application area, modeling approach and the specific peculiarities characterizing each area. Findings The review revealed that maintenance and sustainability modeling is an emerging area of research that has intensified in the last few years. This fertile area can be developed further in several directions. In particular, there is room for devising models that are implementable, based on reliable and timely data with proven tangible practical results. While the environmental aspect has been considered, there is a clear scarcity of works addressing the social dimension. One of the identified barriers to developing applicable models is the lack of the required, accurate and timely data. Originality/value This work contributes to the maintenance and sustainability modeling research area, provides insights not previously addressed and highlights several avenues for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review that looks at the integration of sustainability issues in maintenance modeling and optimization.

AB  - Resource recovery industries play a significant role in global sustainable development. Although existing reviews have been undertaken on how such sectors address sustainability, these tend not to consider the interconnections among sustainability dimensions in the macro (national/regional, international), meso (industry) and micro (firm/operation) levels of analysis. Taking ship-recycling as a focal resource recovery industry, this systematic literature review of 286 studies provides a holistic synthesis of six sustainability dimensions, producing a taxonomy of three sustainability challenge (environmental, social and economic) and three enabler (law and policy, technology and management) themes. Studies have to date focused on identifying the challenges, typically in a mono-dimensional manner, with less attention paid to developing enabling solutions. Across the challenge dimensions, sustainability is better regarded at the macro and meso levels of analysis, while remaining challenged and less understood at the micro level operations. Thus, the industry in its current state has been argued to face a 'multi-level sustainability paradox'. Of the enabler themes, the law and policy investigations in ship-recycling predominantly addressed the macro-level issues in analysing the deficiency of current regulatory mechanisms and offering future ones. Conversely, the comparatively scarce studies on developing technological and management enablers have addressed the micro-level issues more to create environmentally and socially sustainable ship-recycling practices. This review concludes with suggestions for future research that considers a systems view to demonstrate how the sustainability challenges and enablers in ship-recycling are interconnected across various dimensions and levels of analysis - and form self-reinforcing vicious cycles which are more readily addressable through management enablers.

AB  - Moroccan fir, known botanically as Abies marocana Trab. (Pinaceae), is a North African mountain coniferous species endemic to the calcareous ridge of the western Rif Mountains (northern Morocco). It is adapted to humid and perhumid bioclimates. It is one of the circum-Mediterranean firs of the section Piceaster, characterized by rigid needles. The species is endangered and included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This relict species plays key ecological roles in maintaining genetic, specific and ecosystemic biodiversity. Little attention has been devoted to A. marocana forest regeneration, which is one of the biggest concerns for scientists and managers. The present review critically synthesizes the available peer-reviewed literature on A. marocana to highlight the scientific advances on this species and to address knowledge gaps that may constitute future research perspectives. The factors threatening the existence of A. marocana forests the most are anthropogenic pressure, mainly agricultural expansion (especially the cultivation of Cannabis), which is reported to be the main cause of the continuous decline in the range of the species, and climate change. We have identified several knowledge gaps, mainly in species ecophysiology, climate change impacts, pests and diseases, seed germination and regeneration requirements, restoration, biological properties of essential oils and organic extracts, and ex situ conservation. Suitable strategies for both in situ and ex situ conservation of the species should be an urgent topic for both scientists and foresters.

AB  - Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered the preferred loco-regional treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to resection due to its distinctive blend of precise drug administration, localized tumor management, and reduced systemic adverse effects, setting it apart from the plethora of alternative treatments available. There is an ongoing debate regarding the optimal choice for managing HCC using TACE, particularly between its two major types: conventional TACE (cTACE) and drugeluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE). The medical community remains divided on which approach offers superior safety and efficacy, with conflicting evidence and varied outcomes adding to the complexity of this nuanced decision. Given the lack of consensus surrounding the preferred TACE technique in treatment-naive patients for HCC, we conducted a rigorous systematic review to assess and contrast the relative safety and efficacy of cTACE versus DEB-TACE in patients diagnosed with HCC who did not receive any prior treatment for HCC. Our study aimed to provide much-needed clarity on this controversial topic, shedding light on the two approaches' comparative safety and efficacy to inform clinical decision-making. After a comprehensive search of databases and search engines and through a methodical screening process, including standardized quality assessments and relevant filter application based on our eligibility criteria, we identified 10 articles pertinent to our research query comprising two randomized controlled trials, one meta-analysis, and seven observational studies. The collective sample size of the studies was 5,288 patients with HCC, of which 2,959 were in the cTACE arm and 2,324 were in the DEB-TACE arm.

AB  - The automotive industry is frequently associated with high polluting manufacturing systems, which raise concern owing to the current environmental frame. For this reason, new alternative manufacturing technologies with lower environmental impact have been proposed and tested, such as additive manufacturing (AM). Since AM technologies produce almost no waste, they can represent a huge opportunity for the automotive industry to become greener. In this sense, the object of the present review is to explore the challenges and strategies of 3D printing, recycling, and circular economy in the automotive industry. Therefore, to achieve the aim of the study, a systematic review methodology was used in five stages: (1) defining the targets; (2) extraction of papers from Scopus; (3) text mining and corpora text analysis of relevant documents from the platform; (4) identification of the dominant categories of the research topics; and (5) discussion and control of obtained results and provision of recommendations for future studies. The analysis of 14 relevant articles revealed that 3D printing technology represents an opportunity to empower small-scale producers of polymers, recycle ELV materials, and decentralize the supply chains of plastic articles. The possibility to include plastic parts produced by AM technology has been pointed out as an innovative option for car manufacturers. Unfortunately, till the present day, poor information was found in this regard. Findings highlighted the need for strategies to turn polymeric automotive components into more eco-friendly and safer materials, improve the supply chain of polymers, perform sustainability assessments, and reformulate waste policies for ELVs.

AB  - Objective: This qualitative systematic review aimed to identify advances in finance studies that are using Institutional Theory as a theoretical platform. Methodology: 65 articles were examined, 12 national and 53 international. Thus, 4 articles from national journals and 28 from international journals were selected for the systematic review of the literature, 33 articles were excluded for not meeting the research criteria because: they are not related to the field of finance and use Institutional Theory as a basis for discussions. Results: The results demonstrate the understanding of Institutional Theory as a theoretical line that can help to understand phenomena in the area of finance, such as corporate governance, performance measurement and disclosure, mergers and acquisitions, cultural finance, risks, decisions of investment and financing and implications of earnings management. Contributions: There are contributions to reinforce the Institutional Theory, by showing how institutional characteristics interact in a complementary way for the development of financial markets by adopting practices that are legitimized by the main stakeholders. In relation to the contribution to the field of finance, it was possible to observe a step forward in the restructuring of the field, by incorporating social and international pressures into research. For policy makers, regulators and managers, legislation may be adopted in order to improve management processes, or be adopted for reasons of legitimacy with stakeholders to ensure longer survival. On the other hand, the dynamics of the environment may not be accepted by organizations, and these may migrate to environments that are better for them.

AB  - Land allocation has been an important issue in land use planning research studies. Land allocation involves different multifunctional activities of maximizing environmental, economic and social benefits. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is the most popular tool to optimize land allocation problems by considering decision variables, conflicting objectives, and criteria. Hence, decision-makers face problems on how to optimize the land allocation while minimizing the conflicting trade-offs existing in the decision analysis. With this review study, we aim at identifying and extracting information on MCDM methods to solve land allocation problems from English language articles published between 2000 and 2019 and indexed by four scientific literature databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Google scholar). To this end, we applied a systematic literature review approach, i.e. the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis procedure (Moher et al., 2009), with a structured database search expression. 120 articles were selected of which, after careful screening of title, keywords and abstract, 69 were retained for detailed review. This review study report compiles comprehensive information by classifying the papers into application area, optimization objectives, criteria used, decision techniques, publication year and study region. In summary, we found that in the last two decades, the use of the MCDM method has increased, particularly in Europe and China. AHP (analytical hierarchal process) is frequently used for multi-attribute land allocation problems with reference to ecotourism and ecosystem management. LP (linear programming) and SA (simulating annealing) methods are predominantly used to optimize multi-objectives complex agricultural and forest land allocation problems respectively.

AB  - BackgroundGastrointestinal symptoms and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases exist at higher rates in the autistic population. It is not clear however whether autism is associated with elevated gastrointestinal inflammation as studies examining non-invasive faecal biomarkers report conflicting findings. To understand the research landscape and identify gaps, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies measuring non-invasive markers of gastrointestinal inflammation in autistic and non-autistic samples. Our examination focused on faecal biomarkers as sampling is non-invasive and these markers are a direct reflection of inflammatory processes in the gastrointestinal tract.MethodsWe extracted data from case-control studies examining faecal markers of gastrointestinal inflammation. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection and Epistemonikos and forward and backwards citations of included studies published up to April 14, 2023 (PROSPERO CRD42022369279).ResultsThere were few studies examining faecal markers of gastrointestinal inflammation in the autistic population, and many established markers have not been studied. Meta-analyses of studies examining calprotectin (n = 9) and lactoferrin (n = 3) were carried out. A total of 508 autistic children and adolescents and 397 non-autistic children and adolescents were included in the meta-analysis of calprotectin studies which found no significant group differences (ROM: 1.30 [0.91, 1.86]). Estimated differences in calprotectin were lower in studies with siblings and studies which did not exclude non-autistic controls with gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 139 autistic participants and 75 non-autistic controls were included in the meta-analysis of lactoferrin studies which found no significant group differences (ROM: 1.27 [0.79, 2.04]).LimitationsAll studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis examined children and adolescents. Many studies included non-autistic controls with gastrointestinal symptoms which limit the validity of their findings. The majority of studies of gastrointestinal inflammation focused on children under 12 with few studies including adolescent participants. Most studies that included participants aged four or under did not account for the impact of age on calprotectin levels. Future studies should screen for relevant confounders, include larger samples and explore gastrointestinal inflammation in autistic adolescents and adults.ConclusionsThere is no evidence to suggest higher levels of gastrointestinal inflammation as measured by calprotectin and lactoferrin are present in autistic children and adolescents at the population level. Preliminary evidence suggests however that higher calprotectin levels may be present in a subset of autistic participants, who may be clinically characterised by more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and higher levels of autistic traits.

AB  - Purpose - Decision making in logistics is an increasingly complex task for organizations as these involve decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels coupled with the triple-bottom line of sustainability. Decision support systems (DSS) played a vital role in arguably solving the challenges associated with decision making in sustainable logistics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of the research in the domain of DSS for logistics while considering sustainability aspects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review approach using a set of relevant keywords with several exclusion criteria was adopted to identify literature related to DSS for sustainable logistics. A total of 40 papers were found from 1994 to 2015, which were then analyzed along the dimensions of publishing trend, geographic distribution and collaboration, the most influential journals, affiliations and authors as well as the key themes of identified literature. The analysis was conducted by means of bibliometric and text mapping tools, namely BibExcel, gpsvisualizer and VOSviewer.
   Findings - The bibliometric analysis showed that DSS for sustainable logistics is an emerging field; however, it is still evolving but at a slower pace. Furthermore, most of the contributing affiliations belong to the USA and the UK. The text mining and keyword analysis revealed key themes of identified papers. The inherent key themes were decision models and frameworks to address sustainable logistics issues covering transport, distribution and third-party logistics. The most prominent sustainable logistics issue was carbon footprinting. Social impact has been given less attention in comparison to economic and environmental aspects. The literature has adequate room for proposing more effective solutions by considering various types of multi-criteria decision analysis methods and DSS configurations while simultaneously considering economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable logistics. Moreover, the field has potential to include logistics from wide application areas including freight transport through road, rail, sea, air as well as inter-modal transport, port operations, material handling and warehousing.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of DSS for sustainable logistics using bibliometric and text analysis. The key themes and research gaps identified in this paper will provide a reference point that will encourage and guide interested researchers for future study, thus aiding both theoretical and practical advancements in this discipline.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to synthesize the corpus of literature relating to succession planning in higher education, in particular, this paper explores the growth of succession planning practices in the higher education sector, which allows equal opportunity for genders to secure leadership positions in a unique fashion. Through the systematic review of 73 studies related to succession planning in higher education published in scholarly journals and dissertations from university repositories, this paper evidences the growth of empirical research on succession planning. Nonetheless, the current work hardly addresses dearth of succession planning for females in academia particularly in unique contexts that depict organizational, cultural, and personal nuances that heterogeneously submerge performances. Through a synthesis of the literature, this paper proposes areas of research to evaluate the hindrance factors in future empirical studies. The results indicate that further robust studies using action research design, quasi-experiment, and pilot interventions may be relevant to address the leadership crisis in higher education.

AB  - Despite the recent interest in the Industry 4.0 applications for sustainability, little is known on the processes through which digital transformation and Industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable innovation in manufacturing. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that explains how businesses can leverage Industry 4.0 technologies to introduce sustainability into innovative practices. For this purpose, the study conducts a systematic review of extant literature to identify Industry 4.0 functions for sustainable innovation and applies interpretive structural modeling to devise the promised roadmap. The results offer interesting insights into Industry 4.0 applications for sustainable innovation. The strategic roadmap developed reveals that Industry 4.0 enables sustainable innovation through 11 functions. Industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies and principles allow businesses to improve interfunctional collaboration and better integrate with internal and external stakeholders. Industry 4.0 further improves the knowledge base and advanced manufacturing competency and promotes organizational capabilities valuable to sustainable innovation such as green absorptive capacity, sustainable partnership, and sustainable innovation orientation. Through these functions, Industry 4.0 subsequently enhances green process innovation capacity and the ability to develop or reintroduce eco-friendly products economically and competitively. Overall, the roadmap explains the complex precedence relationships among the 11 sustainable innovation functions of Industry 4.0, offering important implications for businesses that seek to leverage Industry 4.0 sustainability implications and manage sustainable development.

AB  - Achieving sufficient, safe, continuously-available drinking water services in rural areas is a challenge, in high- and especially low-and middle-income countries. External support programs (ESPs) - which may include administrative, financial, and technical assistance - have been hypothesized to contribute to sustainable rural water services. While there are many descriptions of ESPs, a standard terminology and typology of ESP activities does not exist and the effect of ESP activities on system sustainability remains inadequately characterized. We conducted a systematic review of ESPs for rural drinking water systems to identify ESP terminology and describe ESP activities. Findings from 218 publications from low-, middle-, and high-income countries were analyzed. ESP terms were used inconsistently between regions and income classifications. There were few studies describing ESP activities related to mechanized piped water systems. Few studies quantitatively assess the effect of ESPs. Those that did found positive associations with functionality, household satisfaction, household participation, and financial stability. This review is the first comprehensive evaluation of the ESP literature and we derive a definition of external support programs and typology of ESP activities from the descriptions of ESPs. A common understanding of ESPs facilitates discussion and knowledge transfer between stakeholders. Consistent terminology creates a foundation for adapting ESPs to water services in community institutions and for mechanized piped water systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Future changes in temperature, rainfall and soil moisture could threaten agricultural land use and crop productivity in Europe, with major consequences for food security. Weassessed the projected impacts of climate change on the yield of seven major crop types (viz wheat, barley, maize, potato, sugar beet, rice and rye) grown in Europe using a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of data reported in 41 original publications from an initial screening of 1748 studies. Our approach adopted an established SR procedure developed by the Centre for Evidence Based Conservation constrained by inclusion criteria and defined methods for literature searches, data extraction, meta-analysis and synthesis. Whilst similar studies exist to assess climate impacts on crop yield in Africa and South Asia, surprisingly, no comparable synthesis has been undertaken for Europe. Based on the reported results (n =729) we show that the projected change in average yield in Europe for the seven crops by the 2050s is + 8%. For wheat and sugar beet, average yield changes of + 14% and + 15% are projected, respectively. There were strong regional differences with crop impacts in northern Europe being higher (+ 14%) and more variable compared to central (+ 6%) and southern (+ 5) Europe. Maize is projected to suffer the largest negative mean change in southern Europe (-11%). Evidence of climate impacts on yield was extensive for wheat, maize, sugar beet and potato, but very limited for barley, rice and rye. The implications for supporting climate adaptation policy and informing climate impacts crop science research in Europe are discussed.

AB  - Simulation modeling has become common for estimating the spread of highly contagious animal diseases. Several models have been developed to mimic the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in specific regions or countries, conduct risk assessment, analyze outbreaks using historical data or hypothetical scenarios, assist in policy decisions during epidemics, formulate preparedness plans, and evaluate economic impacts. Majority of the available FMD simulation models were designed for and applied in disease-free countries, while there has been limited use of such models in FMD endemic countries. This paper's objective was to report the findings from a study conducted to review the existing published original research literature on spatially explicit stochastic simulation (SESS) models of FMD spread, focusing on assessing these models for their potential use in endemic settings. The goal was to identify the specific components of endemic FMD needed to adapt these SESS models for their potential application in FMD endemic settings. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines, and three databases were searched, which resulted in 1176 citations. Eighty citations finally met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis, identifying nine unique SESS models. These SESS models were assessed for their potential application in endemic settings. The assessed SESS models can be adapted for use in FMD endemic countries by modifying the underlying code to include multiple cocirculating serotypes, routine prophylactic vaccination (RPV), and livestock population dynamics to more realistically mimic the endemic characteristics of FMD. The application of SESS models in endemic settings will help evaluate strategies for FMD control, which will improve livestock health, provide economic gains for producers, help alleviate poverty and hunger, and will complement efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the research focusing on the decarbonization strategy of businesses, stock return performance, and investment styles. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes bibliometric methods and content analysis to present a broad overview of the research on the association between decarbonization strategies in businesses and financial performance in the last few decades. The final dataset contains 272 records published between 2001 and early 2021, available in the Web of Science (WoS) database. Findings The authors find a relatively small number of publications before 2010 and the research focus increases only after 2016. There exists limited knowledge on the links between climate change strategies and firm performance till date. The top management journals have also failed to respond to the importance of decarbonization strategies in firms and their relationship with stock returns and investment styles. Furthermore, there is a limited indication of publications from ecology and the environmental sciences, in general, being included or cited by the business and management research studies, thus highlighting weak network linkages between the two fields. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to the literature on decarbonization strategies of businesses, and the strategies' relation with firm performance by consolidating the extant research and thus finding the research gaps and research areas that require further investigation. Practical implications For the industry professionals, this research provides a comprehensive repository of articles on incorporating decarbonization strategies in industry professionals' decisions on improving firm performance. Originality/value This paper examines the history and development of themes, related to firms' emission mitigation strategies, firm performance and investment styles, across the journal articles in the WoS database published from 2001 to early 2021. In addition, the authors highlight research directions and the need for research on sustainable strategies in businesses, stock return, and investment styles.

AB  - BackgroundNeonatal care is commonly regionalised, meaning specialist services are only available at certain units. Consequently, infants with surgical conditions needing specialist care who are born in non-surgical centres require postnatal transfer. Best practice models advocate for colocated maternity and surgical services as the place of birth for infants with antenatally diagnosed congenital conditions to avoid postnatal transfers. We conducted a systematic review to explore the association between location of birth and short-term outcomes of babies with gastroschisis, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and oesophageal atresia with or without tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF/OA). MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases for studies from high income countries comparing outcomes for infants with gastroschisis, CDH or TOF/OA based on their place of delivery. Outcomes of interest included mortality, length of stay, age at first feed, comorbidities and duration of parenteral nutrition. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We present a narrative synthesis of our findings. ResultsNineteen cohort studies compared outcomes of babies with one of gastroschisis, CDH or TOF/OA. Heterogeneity across the studies precluded meta-analysis. Eight studies carried out case-mix adjustments. Overall, we found conflicting evidence. There is limited evidence to suggest that birth in a maternity unit with a colocated surgical centre was associated with a reduction in mortality for CDH and decreased length of stay for gastroschisis. ConclusionsThere is little evidence to suggest that delivery in colocated maternity-surgical services may be associated with shortened length of stay and reduced mortality. Our findings are limited by significant heterogeneity, potential for bias and paucity of strong evidence. This supports the need for further research to investigate the impact of birth location on outcomes for babies with congenital surgical conditions and inform future design of neonatal care systems.

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of disease and premature mortality among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians. While the daily smoking prevalence among Indigenous Australians has declined significantly from 49% in 2001, it remains about three times higher than that of non-Indigenous Australians (39 and 14%, respectively, for age >= 15 years in 2014-15). This overview of systematic reviews aimed to synthesise evidence about reducing tobacco consumption among Indigenous peoples using a comprehensive framework for Indigenous tobacco control in Australia comprised of the National Tobacco Strategy (NTS) and National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan (NATSIHP) principles and priorities.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, systematic review and Indigenous health databases were searched (2000 to Jan 2016) for reviews examining the effects of tobacco control interventions among Indigenous peoples. Two reviewers independently screened reviews, extracted data, and assessed review quality using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. Data were synthesised narratively by framework domain. Reporting followed the PRISMA statement.
   Results: Twenty-one reviews of varying quality were included. There was generally limited Indigenous-specific evidence of effective interventions for reducing smoking; however, many reviewers recommended multifaceted interventions which incorporate Indigenous leadership, partnership and engagement and cultural tailoring. Under the NTS priority areas, reviewers reported evidence for brief smoking cessation interventions and pharmacological support, mass media campaigns (on knowledge and attitudes) and reducing affordability and regulation of tobacco sales. Aspects of intervention implementation related to the NATSIHP domains were less well described and evidence was limited; however, reviewers suggested that cultural tailoring, holistic approaches and building workforce capacity were important strategies to address barriers. There was limited evidence regarding social media and mobile applications, for Indigenous youth, pregnant women and prisoners, and no evidence regarding interventions to protect communities from industry interference, the use of electronic cigarettes, interventions for people experiencing mental illness, juvenile justice, linguistic diversity or 'pubs, clubs and restaurants'.
   Conclusions: There is limited Indigenous-specific evidence for most tobacco interventions. A 'comprehensive approach' incorporating NTS and NATSIHP Principles and Priorities of partnership and engagement, evidence from other settings, programme logic and responsive evaluation plans may improve intervention acceptability, effectiveness and implementation and mitigate risks of adapting tobacco evidence for Indigenous Australians.

AB  - The people, planet, and profit sustainability concerns emerged as a novel concept in the ethical business governance system in the floriculture industry. In Ethiopia, however, the sectoral sustainability concern is in its infant stage. Currently, the floriculture industry faced many criticisms because its improper cultivation greatly worsened social well-being and the environment. Therefore, the industry needs to examine the current findings about sustainability and explain the apparent discrepancies. As a result, a systematic review was conducted to analyze the sustainability challenges in the floriculture business and its impact on the environment and society. Relevant studies were collected using the Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. Gray literature search from private and governmental institutions was also conducted. Papers outside the topic's scope or published articles with a weak methodology setup and numerous editorial issues were eliminated. While documents with high relevance to the topic of interest were used as inclusion criteria. Accordingly, 80 articles through databases and 29 papers via gray literature search were collected and chosen for synthesis. In this article, therefore, the Ethiopian floriculture industry sustainability challenges were analyzed along with various empirical findings. The effects of unsustainable flower farming on society, soil and water health were also enclosed. The underlying factors that led to sectoral sustainability problems were addressed and used as debating points for discussion. The paper also contributes to the scientific discussion by highlighting the areas that need further study and the policy ramifications of sustainability in the flower business.

AB  - Deer are among the world's most successful invasive mammals and can have substantial deleterious impacts on natural and agricultural ecosystems. Six species have established wild populations in Australia, and the distributions and abundances of some species are increasing. Approaches to managing wild deer in Australia are diverse and complex, with some populations managed as 'game' and others as 'pests'. Implementation of cost-effective management strategies that account for this complexity is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the nature, extent and severity of deer impacts. To clarify the knowledge base and identify research needs, we conducted a systematic review of the impacts and management of wild deer in Australia. Most wild deer are in south-eastern Australia, but bioclimatic analysis suggested that four species are well suited to the tropical and subtropical climates of northern Australia. Deer could potentially occupy most of the continent, including parts of the arid interior. The most significant impacts are likely to occur through direct effects of herbivory, with potentially cascading indirect effects on fauna and ecosystem processes. However, evidence of impacts in Australia is largely observational, and few studies have experimentally partitioned the impacts of deer from those of sympatric native and other introduced herbivores. Furthermore, there has been little rigorous testing of the efficacy of deer management in Australia, and our understanding of the deer ecology required to guide deer management is limited. We identified the following six priority research areas: (i) identifying long-term changes in plant communities caused by deer; (ii) understanding interactions with other fauna; (iii) measuring impacts on water quality; (iv) assessing economic impacts on agriculture (including as disease vectors); (v) evaluating efficacy of management for mitigating deer impacts; and (vi) quantifying changes in distribution and abundance. Addressing these knowledge gaps will assist the development and prioritisation of cost-effective management strategies and help increase stakeholder support for managing the impacts of deer on Australian ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis sought to investigate the patterns of use of native wild food plants of Brazil (native and non-cultivated).MethodsWe searched ethnobiological works with food plants in Web of Science, Scielo, Scopus and PubMed using different sets of keywords. Initially, the studies were evaluated based on inclusion criteria (systematic data collection instruments, such as interviews; specification of methods for data collection; and the presence of a species list). The methodological quality of each study was evaluated to define the risk of bias. A total of 20 articles met all criteria and were included in the review.ResultsThe results showed that there was a predominance of consumption of fruits, followed by leaves and seeds, which together represented 85.8% of the total parts. As for the meta-analysis, there was a predominance of use of plant parts classified as reproductive, non-persistent, non-destructive and parts of woody plants. There was no interference from the type of ecosystem (seasonally dry x moist). The results did not support the seasonality hypothesis.ConclusionsThe concentration of studies in the Northeast, Southeast and South regions of Brazil and in the Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes points to the need for a greater effort in terms of quantitative ethnobotanical research in other regions and biomes. The predominance of fruits and plant parts classified as reproductive, non-persistent and non-destructive points to the high potential for implementation of sustainable management strategies aimed at these plants in the country.

AB  - This analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence of the efficacy of iron biofortification interventions on iron status and functional outcomes. Iron deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide, with a disproportionate impact on women and young children, particularly those living in resource-limited settings. Biofortification, or the enhancing of micronutrient content in staple crops, is a promising and sustainable agriculture-based approach to improve nutritional status. Previous randomised efficacy trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that iron-biofortification interventions improved iron biomarkers; however, no systematic reviews to date have examined the efficacy of biofortification interventions on health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of iron-biofortified staple crops on iron status and functional outcomes: cognitive function (e.g. attention, memory) and physical performance. Five studies from three randomised efficacy trials (i.e. rice, pearl millet, beans) conducted in the Philippines, India and Rwanda were identified for inclusion in this review. Iron status (Hb, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, total body iron, -1-acid glycoprotein) was measured at baseline and endline in each trial; two studies reported cognitive outcomes, and no studies reported other functional outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects methods. Iron-biofortified crop interventions significantly improved cognitive performance in attention and memory domains, compared with conventional crops. There were no significant effects on categorical outcomes such as iron deficiency or anaemia. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of iron-biofortified staple crops on human health, including additional functional outcomes and other high-risk populations.

AB  - Objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health concern worldwide with a large impact in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as a consequence of protracted wars and conflicts that adversely affect the general population. Currently, systematic TBI studies in the MENA region are lacking, nonetheless they are immensely needed to enhance trauma management and increase survival rates among TBI patients. This systematic review aims to characterize TBI in the MENA region to guide future policy choices and research efforts and inform tailored guidelines capable of improving TBI management and patient treatment and outcome. Furthermore, it will serve as a road map to evaluate and assess knowledge of trauma impact on regional health systems that can be adopted by health-care providers to raise awareness and improve trauma care. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy of several databases including MEDLINE/Ovid, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and the grey literature in accordance with the PROSPERO systematic review protocol CRD42017058952. Abstracts were screened, and selected eligible studies were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. We collected demographics information along with TBI characteristics, mortality rates, and regional distribution. Data were extracted using REDCap and checked for accuracy. Results: The search strategy yielded 23,385 citations; 147 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Motor vehicle accident (MVA) was the leading cause of TBI (41%) in the MENA region, followed by the military- (15.6%) and fall- (8.8%) related TBI. Males predominantly suffer from TBI-related injuries (85%), with a high prevalence of MVA- and military-related TBI injuries. The TBI mortality rate was 12.9%. The leading causes of mortality were MVA (68%), military (20.5%), and assault (2.9%). The vast majority of reported TBI severity was mild (63.1%) compared to moderate (10.7%) and severe TBI (20.2%). Patients mainly underwent a Glasgow Coma Scale assessment (22.1%), followed by computed tomography scan (8.9%) and surgery (4.1%). Conclusions: Despite its clinical, social, and economic burden, the evidence of TBI research in the MENA region is scarce. Further research and high-quality epidemiological studies are urgently needed to gain a deep understanding of the TBI burden in the region, facilitate the allocation of adequate resources, implement effective preventive and intervention strategies and advise on the TBI patient management as reflective on the TBI patterns and modes.

AB  - Remittances are essential to the sustainability of economies in mountainous regions that face massive labour migration due to limited income generation and employment opportunities. In 2021, the share of remittances in GDP in the top 10 mountainous economies in the world was over 20%. Nonetheless, most are characterised by relatively lower GDP per capita and high poverty levels. Drawing a comparison with other mountainous areas, Phuthaditjhaba, an emerging mountainous city of South Africa on the border with Lesotho, faces similar out-migration and inferior socio-economic parameters. A global systematic literature review on the impact of remittances on livelihoods, specifically targeting mountainous areas, is missing. We, therefore, interrogate the role that remittances can play in Phuthaditjhaba. To inform our intended research, we seek to draw lessons from evidence on how migration and remittances affect mountainous communities globally. Accordingly, we carry out a systematic literature review (SLR) based on an updated Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 statement supported by bibliometric (co-word) analysis (BA) in VOSViewer. We collected data from the Scopus and Dimensions websites and drew 165 publications, of which only 88 were included after exclusion and inclusion assessments. The PRISMA results show that Mountain Research and Development, Russell King, and Nepal are the most productive and cited journal, the most productive and cited author, and the most researched country, respectively. The bibliometric analysis on keyword co-occurrences revealed that women, agriculture, labour migration, land management, forest, and poverty are the research hotspots. In light of these findings, we proffer important recommendations for future researchers and policymakers and identify thematic research areas for Phuthaditjhaba.

AB  - In dryland Africa, access to land and water resources are central to pastoral livelihood activities. Policy intervention in these regions represents the outcome of concerted post-independence processes in which countries have committed to land tenure transformation as a policy objective. This was meant to create private, liberal property rights to replace communal customary tenure systems which were considered to be a constraint to development. Despite these efforts, decades of scientific research indicate that countries are still struggling to meet environmental sustainability objectives. Land degradation where it existed has not been halted and traditional pastoral livelihoods have been disrupted. The overall evidence base for policymaking remains weak as deficiencies in data or information on which management decisions were based led to poor policy performance. In a bid to strengthen understanding in this area, this study has a dual aim: 1. Using a systematic review of the literature, we examine the impact of land tenure transformation in pastoral areas in sub-Saharan Africa; 2. We analyse user-perspectives on land tenure transformation and pastoralists' rights in Ngamiland, Botswana, so as to draw out the salient issues that must be addressed in order to reconcile pastoral tenure conflicts and land management in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from meta-analysis and case study show that land tenure transformation policies across pastoral areas are subject to similar challenges and consequences. Protecting pastoral land rights requires deliberate policy interventions that recognise pastoralism as a productive and efficient use of resources. Policymakers need to overcome anti-pastoral prejudice and focus on Sustainable Land Management goals. This entails establishing negotiated and flexible tenure frameworks that strengthen pastoralists' participation in decision-making arenas by working with pastoral communities on the basis of understanding their livelihood system.

AB  - Over the past decades, landscapes worldwide have experienced changes (e.g., urbanization, agricultural intensification, expansion of renewable energy uses) at magnitudes that put their sustainability at risk. The understanding of the drivers of these landscape changes remains challenging, partly because landscape research is spread across many domains and disciplines. We here provide a systematic synthesis of 144 studies that identify the proximate and underlying drivers of landscape change across Europe. First, we categorize how driving forces have been addressed and find that most studies consider medium-term time scales and local spatial scales. Most studies assessed only one case study area, one spatial scale, and less than four points in time. Second, we analyze geographical coverage of studies and reveal that countries with a non-European Union/European Free Trade Association membership; low Gross Domestic Product; boreal, steppic, and arctic landscapes; as well as forestland systems are underrepresented in the literature. Third, our review shows that land abandonment/extensification is the most prominent (62% of cases) among multiple proximate drivers of landscape change. Fourthly, we find that distinct combinations of mainly political/institutional, cultural, and natural/spatial underlying drivers are determining landscape change, rather than single key drivers. Our systematic review indicates knowledge gaps that can be filled by: (a) expanding the scope of studies to include underrepresented landscapes; (b) clarifying the identification and role of actors in landscape change; (c) deploying more robust tools and methods to quantitatively assess the causalities of landscape change; (d) setting up long-term studies that go beyond mapping land-cover change only; (e) strengthening cross-site and cross-country comparisons of landscape drivers; (f) designing multi-scale studies that consider teleconnections; (g) considering subtle and novel processes of landscape change.

AB  - Benefit-sharing has been instrumental in empowering local communities living on the edge of protected areas to engage in natural resource management and enhance biodiversity conservation outcomes. Tanzania has various categories of protected area managed by six main conservation institutions, each with different types of benefit-sharing mechanisms. To investigate the acceptability of these mechanisms among local communities living in proximity to protected areas and their effectiveness at delivering benefits, we undertook a systematic review of > 1000 peer reviewed articles related to the topic published between January 1990 and February 2021. The 71 publications that met our selection criteria covered all the main categories of protected area in Tanzania. Benefit-sharing mechanisms took three forms: i. social services provision; ii. livelihood provision; and iii. employment for local people. About half the studies (48%) indicated that local people accepted or strongly accepted the benefits provided by conservation institutions in Tanzania with the level of community acceptance linked strongly with the history of engagement between communities and the conservation institutions while 40% of the reviewed studies indicated the negative views. We recommend that future research explores the values and demand for benefits among local people living close to protected areas, particularly in disaffected communities, to ensure benefit-sharing mechanisms deliver desirable socio-economic outcomes for local communities as well as conservation outcomes.

AB  - Micro-mobility vehicles (MMVs), including a range of small-size and light-weight vehicles such as (e-)bicycles and (e-)scooters, are becoming more popular and widely used, which also brings a challenge to the efficient and safe utilisation of road infrastructure. Especially, the coexistence of pedestrians and MMVs in a space sharing context raises many concerns on road safety. This paper provides a systematic review of relevant studies on the interactions between pedestrians and MMVs in shared spaces. The most investigated factors include infrastructure features (e.g., road environment and regulations), road users' characteristics (e.g., demographic information and behavioural norms), and operation conditions (e.g., dynamic factors and traffic features). Our findings suggest that space sharing could be encouraged for pedestrians and MMV users. More efforts are needed on multi-source data collection, processing, and application. Further in-vestigations need to focus on multiple types of MMVs, high-density conditions, emergency con-ditions, MMVs' parking issues, and MMVs' functions.

Flooding is one particularly deadly example of its amplifying and expanding effect on public health. This systematic review considered evidence linking green building strategies in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) (LEED) Rating System with the potential to reduce negative health outcomes following exposure to urban flooding events. Queries evaluated links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to urban flooding, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits to leveraging green building design to enhance flooding resilience included: improving the interface between humans and wildlife and reducing the risk of waterborne disease, flood-related morbidity and mortality, and psychological harm. We conclude that collaborations among the public health, climate change, civil society, and green building sectors to enhance community resilience to urban flooding could benefit population health.

AB  - Distribution networks with transshipment are an important factor for moving of products and inputs, promoting and improving the reduction of transportation costs regarding distribution problems. This paper focuses on answering the following question based on a systematic literature review (SLR): How do transshipment distribution networks influence the reduction of transportation costs in resilient companies? A review and an estimation of preliminary re-search was carried out for a period of five years, operating the search engines of SciencieDirect, Redalyc, Dialnet, Scielo, and SpringerLink. The studies were selected based on a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. It was highli-ghted that distribution networks with transshipment have a direct relationship with companies and aim for their we-ll-being. On the other hand, the importance and theoretical bases of distribution networks were observed. The SLR collected clear and precise data for the study, which contributed to the understanding of the direct relationship be-tween distribution networks and companies. The importance of logistics with transshipment in business resilience was established, which includes three basic aspects (recovery, vulnerability, and adaptation) with respect to the con-ditions of distribution as a contribution to sustainable development.

AB  - The present paper provides a systematic overview of the way decarbonisation has been treated in social sciences in recent years. Titles and keywords of 404 papers, published from 2015 to June 2020, and indexed in the Scopus database, were submitted to lexicometric and bibliometric analyses. Results confirm that decarbonisation has become a key term in social sciences research on energy, with a growing number of articles published by interdisciplinary journals. Key terms associated with decarbonisation shifted their focus from issues connected with production to broader themes related to sustainability and solutions. Governance, discourse in the social arena and public opinion are the main semantic associated areas emerging from the selected sample. Themes included in these areas range from biophysical and technological risks to social movements, issues of justice, and visions of the future. The overall picture detected in the current study poses further questions and suggests possible research paths concerning the voices and themes at the centre of the stage and those left in the shadows.

AB  - Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) province, Indonesia is beset by high vulnerability to climate change and weak adaptive capacity to address its effects. Livelihoods in the province are intimately tied to increasingly scarce and contested ecosystem goods and services. The population's climate vulnerability is further exacerbated by social, economic, and cultural drivers of vulnerability, such as rapid population growth, pervasive corruption, and inadequate community participation in planning processes. Scholars and practitioners have begun conceptualizing and implementing adaptive comanagement (ACM) approaches in NTB. ACM is an environmental governance approach for complex, multi-scale social-ecological systems facing uncertainty and rapid system changes. ACM aims to forge vertical and horizontal links for shared learning between the various actors of multi-level resource management systems. The province's markedly heterogeneous physical and social geographies present a unique opportunity to glean lessons applicable to a range of contexts including rural communities, island geographies, the Indonesian archipelago, the tropical Asia-Pacific region, and the developing world more broadly. This paper provides a systematic review of efforts to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate adaptive comanagement approaches in Nusa Tenggara Barat. In doing so, it characterizes the literature, discerns salient thematic components, and identifies areas for further research and action on the conceptualization and implementation of adaptive comanagement.

AB  - Recently, a new program of territorial study was launched in the area of Wadi Takarkori (Wadi Takarkori Project, hereafter WTP), located in south-western Libya at the border with Algeria in a strategic position between the Tassili and Acacus Mountains. The core of this program was the excavation of a rock shelter together with the systematic mapping and selected excavations of stone structures in the wadi area, mainly tumuli, a typical Saharan feature.
   The excavations from the rock shelter provide fresh information on Holocene groups in the central Sahara and give deep insight into their funerary practices. Fifteen burials of women, juveniles and children (no adult males were found) were unearthed from a restricted part of the site. The burials belonged to different cultural phases, from sporadic. evidence of Late Acacus hunter-gatherers (ca. 8000 BP) throughout the Pastoral sequence (ca. 7300-4200 BP).
   A survey in the area of Wadi Takarkori revealed the presence of several stone structures; 7 have been excavated, and 5 of them hosted human burials of adult males and juveniles of Late and Final Pastoral phases (ca. 4500-3100 BP), which suggest a diversified and more articulated picture of land use during the late Holocene.
   The integration of archaeological and isotopic data reveals the social and ideological changes that took place in the region across the millennia. Particularly, during the Early and Middle Pastoral, herders concentrated their burials inside shelters to mark a relation between the lived-in environment and a burial space that is repeatedly used by a section of the group. This pattern reflects the idea of a persistent deathplace. During the Late Pastoral, mobile groups transferred their funerary fixtures - now stone tumuli - along the open spaces of the wadi, marking a separation between world of the living and world of the dead.

AB  - In order to meet future food demand while sustainably managing available land and water resources, irrigated agriculture in semi-arid regions needs to adapt as a response to climate and socio-economic change. In this study, we focus on the Mediterranean region, a dynamic region, which is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture. We provide insight on adaptation strategies implemented on farm level, by doing a systematic review of studies in the region. Our analysis reports 286 implemented adaptations, on 124 different locations throughout the Mediterranean. Additionally, 142 drivers and 324 effects of adaptations were noted. We identified 31 adaptation strategies in 5 main categories: (1) water management, (2) sustainable resource management, (3) technological developments, (4) farm production practices, and (5) farm management. Strategies in the categories water management and farm production practices are most often implemented by farmers in the region. The main driver in the area is water scarcity and adaptations often affected water use and resources in addition to farm practices. Subsequently, we studied the spatial context of adaptations by analyzing the location factors of the five main strategies, using Geographic Information Systems and maximum entropy modeling. Our results show that farmers are more likely to adapt in less rural areas with lower poverty values and better market access, and in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall. This demonstrates that both biophysical and socio-economic factors determine the context in which adaptations are implemented and that considerable spatial variability in the area exists.

AB  - Globally, the extent of inland wetlands has declined by approximately 70% since the start of the twentieth century, resulting in the loss of important wetland-associated ecosystem services. We evaluate the drivers of wetland values in agricultural landscapes to increase the effectiveness and reliability of benefit transfer tools to assign values to local wetland services. We reviewed 668 studies that analyzed wetland ecosystem services within agricultural environments and identified 45 studies across 22 countries that provided sufficient economic information to be included in a quantitative meta-analysis. We developed meta-regression models to represent provisioning and regulating wetland ecosystem services and identify the main drivers of these ecosystem service categories. Provisioning wetland ecosystem service values were best explained (direction of effects in parenthesis) by high-income variable (+), peer-reviewed journal publications (+), agricultural total factor productivity index (-) and population density (+), while agricultural total factor productivity index (-), income level ( +) and wetland area (-) had significant effects on regulating wetland ecosystem service values. Our models can help estimate wetland values more reliably across similar regions because they have significantly lower transfer errors (66 and 185% absolute percentage error for the provisioning and regulating models, respectively) than the errors from unit value transfers. Model predicted wetland values ($/Ha/Year) range from $0.62 to $11,216 for regulating services and $0.95 to $2,122 for provisioning services and vary based on the differences in the levels of the variables (in the wetland locations) that best explained the estimated models.

AB  - Plastic are emerging pollutants requiring urgent intervention for its management. In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, mesoand macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) ( n = 12), macroplastics ( n = 12) or both ( n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified. Policy needs for plastic pollution management identified include stakeholder education, polymer replacement, recycling, tax and incentives to support the sustainability of life below water and on land (UN SDGs 14 and 15).

AB  - Introduction: Today, the role of people in crisis management plans is of particular importance due to the prepared community approach. It is difficult or impossible to attract public involvement due to the low level of public perception of risk. Therefore, it is necessary to discover the status of risk perception and its affecting factors. This study was conducted to investigate factors affecting the strategies of disaster risk perception improvement. Materials and Methods: This systematic review study was conducted in 2017 using extensive electronic and library literature searches in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed electronic databases. The preliminary findings included 1030 studies. Out of 941 retrieved references, 925 references were excluded because they did not meet the objectives of this review or did not focus directly on general population. Finally, 16 articles were selected for further investigation. Results: The extracted variables were divided into four general domains: personal, psychological, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. Personal characteristics included sex, age, marriage, level of education, personal knowledge, and disaster personal experience. Psychological factors comprised emotions (fear and insecurity), mental images (beliefs, attitudes), and internal and external control. Cultural factors such as, belief, values, norms, faith, religious, and protective spirit were effective in general perception of disasters risk. Socioeconomic factors such as, income, livelihood, insurance coverage, trust, and fair access to land and resources were also influential. The strategies to improve public disaster risk perception were educational, participatory, incentive, confidence building, supportive, managerial and cultural ones. A family-centered approach is recommended for the better implementation of strategies. Conclusion: The improvement of risk perception requires government planning in different fields such as education, research, health, and culture, with an emphasis on social groups especially family.

AB  - Current soil phosphorus (P) management is neither environmentally nor economically sustainable. Soil biodiversity has been offered as a solution to unsustainable land management and to promote ecosystem service provision. We know soil biology is instrumental in plant access to soil P, but specific effects of biological complexity, (used here to describe the number of links between different organisms), under different P levels on plant productivity are not well understood. We conducted a meta-analysis on relevant literature, which reported the response of terrestrial plants of economic and anthropogenic importance to P conditions, and controlled for biological treatments across different land-uses (arable, grassland and woodland). We hypothesised that: 1) in amble systems increased biological complexity will enhance plant productivity; 2) in perennial systems such as grassland and woodlands, increasing biological complexity will have no effect; 3) increasing the fertility of the system by addition of P fertiliser will reduce any benefits of biological complexity. We found that soil organisms are not always beneficial to plant shoot biomass, but that the effects of - and interaction among - bacteria, protozoa, nematodes, mycorrhizae, collembola and earthworms differ in their impact on plant biomass (positive or negative) dependent on the presence of other community members, P-level status and time. These findings bring into question existing frameworks that link below-ground biodiversity with above-ground plant productivity. We recommend further experimental work be conducted, which controls for land-use, P status, and soil biological composition and complexity. Such work should be followed by future systematic reviews, which could pragmatically inform more tailored biological management for plant P requirements, land-use and ecosystem service provision. To enable further meta-analyses of this type we recommend habitual inclusion of sufficient experimental detail and data, as a prerequisite for publication and a useful way to utilise increased online publication space.

AB  - Life cycle assessment has been widely applied to quantify the environmental impacts of products and processes; however recent studies highlight its limitations. Critics state that environmental impacts may be misrepresented if spatial and temporal dynamics of production systems are not accounted for. Some authors have used systems thinking methods to account for the temporal dynamics of production systems in life cycle assessment. These applications have been in the areas of solar electricity, wastewater management, electric vehicles, fly ash in cement, mobile phone waste, steel, and the long-term impacts of material sourcing amongst others. The approaches to combining systems thinking methods with life cycle assessment have been both qualitative and quantitative. Some studies have conceptualised the dynamics of systems using causal loop diagrams. They are a systems thinking tool used to map cause and effect as feedback loops that control system behaviours, nurturing a qualitative understanding of the system under study. Over sixty percent of the studies identified in this review have proceeded to using a rigorous mathematical evaluation of the system, namely, a system dynamics model in combination with life cycle assessment. This paper conducts a systematic review of efforts to combine systems thinking methods with life cycle assessment (in their various forms). In particular, it focuses on the two main approaches to combining system dynamics models and life cycle assessment: the inclusion of life cycle inventory and impact assessment factors in a system dynamics model and the inclusion of system dynamics model results in a life cycle assessment. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches will be discussed in this paper to provide guidance for future work.

AB  - Background: Even though the modern contraceptive use was improved in Ethiopia, the utilization of long-acting family planning services is still low because of numerous factors. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize logical evidence about factors associated with long acting family planning service utilization in Ethiopia.
   Methods: The participants of the study were married women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. This search included all published and unpublished observational studies written in the English language conducted before April 30, 2018, in Ethiopia. Electronic and non-electronic sources were used. PubMed, MEDLINE (EBSCO), CINHAL (EBSCO), Embase (EBSCO), POPLINE and the search engines like Google, Google Scholar Mednar and world cat log were used. The overall selected search results were 15 studies. Each study was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Studies. Data synthesis and statistical analysis were conducted using ReviewManagerVersion5.3.5.
   Results: Women's inadequate knowledge level [OR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.83, P = 0.02], women's age between 15 and 34 [OR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.93, P = 0.01], not having electronic media [OR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.79, P < 0.0001] and women from rural area [OR = 0.65;95% CI:0.50, 0.81, P = 0.0009] were less likely associated in the use of long-acting family planning services. The odds of utilizing long acting family planning methods were high among non-government- employed women and husband [OR, 1.77; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.43, P = 0.0004], [OR, 1.69; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.15, P < 0.0001] respectively. Having no previous exposure to any modern family planning method [OR = 2.29; 95%CI: 1.83, 2.86, P < 0.00001] and women having no discussion with husband [OR = 1.92 (95%CI: 1.50, 2.45) P < 0.00001] were more likely associated in the utilization of long-acting family planning services.
   Conclusion: Lack of information and knowledge, having discussion with husband, being women of younger age, having less than five living children, being government-employed women and husband, not having electronic media, and being residents in rural area were significant barriers for underutilization of long acting family planning methods in Ethiopia. Hence, the investigators suggest that key stakeholders should design interventions strategies to avert attitudinal, cultural and informational barriers towards long-acting family planning methods.

AB  - Despite growing evidence that "connectedness" of humans with nature creates multiple benefits for both humans and nature, these benefits are not fully considered by health and conservation policymakers. Studies are scattered across scientific disciplines including health, education, psychology and biology, making it difficult to get a complete overview. Here, we conduct a systematic review, focused on recent meta-analyses that investigate impacts of psychological and/or physical connection with nature on human health and well-being and on attitudes and actions that promote nature conservation. By "psychological connection" we mean the extent to which people see themselves as part of nature and by "physical connection" we mean contact with natural areas. We identified 16 relevant meta-analyses covering 832 independent studies. We found consistent conclusions across geographically diverse experimental studies that physical connection with nature improved human cognition, social skills, physical and mental health, and psychological connection to nature. Experiments also showed that psychological connection with nature had significant positive impact on pro-environmental behaviors and values. Correlational studies supported experimental results and, in addition, found psychological connection with nature positively correlated with mental and physical health. Studies are biased toward adults rather than children and away from southern regions (Africa, Oceania and South America). Overall, our review suggests a critical role for psychological and physical human-nature connections in developing a sustainable future. Although experimental studies are rare, conducting cross-cultural experimental research is needed if governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, researchers and citizens are to develop appropriate actions toward achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - With the rising trend in electricity usage, the amount of waste associated with the mining and processing of coal is also rising rapidly. Over the past few decades, improper utilization of these wastes has led to resource depletion, waste disposal, and environmental pollution issues. The key focus of the present study is to review the literature related to the utilization of untreated and treated coal mining and processing wastes in the construction of sustainable roads. Following a suitable Preferred Reporting Items (PRISMA) framework for systematic review, 67 records are considered for the qualitative analysis. The efficiency of these coal mining and processing wastes as secondary aggregate in the sub-base and/or base layer of pavement is reviewed based on their mechanical (California bearing ratio, Unconfined compressive strength, Flexural strength, and Indirect tensile strength) and durability (Freeze-thaw resistance and Resistance to shrinkage) properties. The effectiveness of chemical stabi-lization on strength gain criteria is also discussed on the basis of microstructural (Scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis. The findings of the present review suggest that utilization of coal wastes in the construction of bound sub-base and/or base not only addresses the waste disposal challenges but also assists the problems associated with raw material depletion. Additionally, based on the outcomes of past studies, this paper identifies the research gaps and presents future research directions that could open new avenues for the sustainable development of pavement.

AB  - Current patterns of global change are threatening the supply of agrarian ecosystem services on which human well-being depends. Within this context, agroecology has emerged within political and scientific arenas as a socially equitable and ecologically sustainable alternative to conventional agriculture. We performed a systematic literature review to explore how agroecology and the ecosystem services framework have been adopted together in the scientific literature, focusing on studies including empirical data on the effects of agroecological practices on the supply of ecosystem services. In our search, we combined terms related to agricultural practices and terms related to ecosystem services. A total of 179 scientific articles were analyzed. Most of the studies used a biophysical approach to evaluate ecosystem services, with regulating and provisioning services being more frequently analyzed than cultural services. More than half of the analyzed relationships between agroecological practices and ecosystem services were positive. Remarkably, our review showed that many of the ten elements of agroecology defined by the FAO have not been properly addressed in the literature. Finally, we identified research gaps and provided insights on where future research and policies should be focused in order to promote the transition towards sustainable agrarian social-ecological systems that increase the supply of ecosystem services while minimizing environmental impacts.

AB  - Integrating scenarios and models to assess the sustainability of future regional ecosystem services is at the forefront of ecosystem service science. However, there are a lack of comprehensive reviews on this topic. Therefore, this study provides a systematic review of the research progress considering two aspects: ecosystem service scenario simulation and sustainability assessments based on the concept of a "safe operating space." We found that (1) a number of studies have already started to explore methods for evaluating the sustainability of future ecosystem services; (2) in terms of scenario construction methods, most existing studies have adopted the global classical scenario downscaling approach, while less consideration has been given to the important socio-economic-environmental characteristics of a region itself, which affect the credibility and policy relevance of scenarios; and (3) in terms of sustainability simulation evaluation, most existing studies are qualitative comparisons of the sustainability of ecosystem services within different scenarios, while quantitative methods are lacking. We proposed an approach that combined participatory scenario construction and a regional safe operating space to address the above identified challenges. Successfully implementing this research approach would provide decision makers with more accurate and practical early warning information regarding the sustainability of future ecosystem services.

AB  - Anthropogenic modification of the countryside has resulted in much of the landscape consisting of fragments of once continuous habitat. Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or longterm monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation. The benefits of such corridors in regard to increasing habitat connectivity remain equivocal, and the role of corridors in mitigating the effects of climate change at the landscape-scale is even less well understood.

AB  - Background/objects
   Early hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis is associated with better long-term survival. Studies of at-risk patients who are monitored in routine practice have reported an overall adherence rate to hepatocellular carcinoma screening/surveillance of approximately 60% and suboptimal diagnostic efficacy of the current screening/surveillance tools. However, it is unclear how many hepatocellular carcinoma patients were actually diagnosed via screening/surveillance given these obstacles. Therefore, via a systematic review of PubMed and Scopus databases from 2000 to 2019, we aimed to identify the proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed via screening/surveillance in routine practice.
   Methods
   We included original research articles of studies of patients already diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma that reported the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed via screening/surveillance.
   Results
   The study included 60 studies and 50 554 hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The pooled proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by screening/surveillance was 37% (95% confidence interval: 31%-44%) and differed by geographic region (North America/Asia/Europe/Oceania/Africa/South America, 31%/42%/41%/30%/29%/47%, P = 0.017, respectively) and by surveillance interval (<12 months 39% vs. 12 months 19%, P < 0.01) but not by disease etiology, cirrhosis status, clinical setting, practice setting, hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis period, or surveillance method.
   Conclusion
   Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed via screening/surveillance in less than half of the patients (37%) regardless of healthcare setting or liver disease etiology and without improvement over time despite several recent guideline updates. Research is needed to understand the barriers to screening/surveillance to include medical as well as social and cultural influences.

AB  - Background: The presenting symptoms and rate of progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) are very heterogeneous. The diverse clinical manifestations and the clinical course of the disease may vary with modifiable risk factors.
   Objective: To systematically review modifiable risk factors and exposures associated with MS progression.
   Methods: We searched six databases till March 2015, reference-mined reviews, and consulted with experts (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42015016461). Two reviewers screened and extracted data. We used random meta-analysis models and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of evidence.
   Results: In total, 59 studies met inclusion criteria. Lower vitamin D levels were associated with higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores (r = -0.22; confidence interval (CI) = -0.32, -0.12; 11 studies; I-2 = 66%), smokers had an increased risk of MS progression (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.55; CI = 1.10, 2.19; I-2 = 72%; seven studies), and there was no association of MS progression with the use of epidural analgesics during childbirth delivery (three studies). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions for 11 risk factors due to conflicting results or use of different predictor and outcome measures.
   Conclusion: MS progression was consistently associated with low vitamin D levels, and smoking was associated with a more rapid decline in MS disability. Studies used a variety of methods, predictors, and outcomes making it difficult to draw conclusions. Future studies should focus on prospective assessments.

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a rise in interest in ride-hailing as a novel form of urban transportation and mobility service. This comprehensive literature analysis evaluates how ride-hailing services affect public road transportation in terms of traffic congestion, safety and security. The evaluation is grounded in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, which includes a thorough search for pertinent studies, careful article screening and selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. This systematic literature review analyses and summarises data from 160 studies examining how ride-hailing services affected public road transportation. The literature review results indicated that ride-hailing services affect public road transportation positively and negatively, depending on various variables such as the regulatory environment, user behaviour, and service accessibility. The positives include greater environmental sustainability, lessening traffic congestion, and increased accessibility and comfort for riders. Nevertheless, the negatives comprise heightened competition among public transportation companies, decreased funding for public transit agencies, and perhaps even unfavourable consequences on ride-hailing drivers' working conditions. Based on the results of our literature review, we can conclude that there is a need for additional research to investigate the intricate relationships between ride-hailing services and public road transportation, as well as to develop suitable policy measures to minimise unfavourable effects and maximise the potential benefits of these ride-hailing services.

AB  - With the rise of globalization and technological competition, the food supply chain has grown more complex due to the multiple players and factors involved in the chain. Traditional systems fail to offer effective and reliable traceability solutions considering the increasing requirement for accountability and transparency in the food supply chain. Blockchain technology has been claimed to offer the food industry a transformative future. The inherent features of blockchain, including immutability and transparency, create a dependable and secure system for tracking food products across the whole supply chain, ensuring total control over their traceability from the origin to the final consumer. This research offers a comprehensive overview of multiple models to understand how the integration of blockchain and other digital technologies has transformed the food supply chain. This comprehensive systematic review of blockchain-based food-supply-chain frameworks aimed to uncover the capability of blockchain technology to revolutionize the industry and examined the current landscape of blockchain-based food traceability solutions to identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the research investigates recent advancements and investigates how blockchain aligns with other emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0. Blockchain technology plays an important role in improving food traceability and supply-chain operations. Potential synergies between blockchain and other emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0 are digitizing food supply chains, which results in better management, automation, efficiencies, sustainability, verifiability, auditability, accountability, traceability, transparency, tracking, monitoring, response times and provenance across food supply chains.

AB  - Although the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced manufacturing technologies, and cloud manufacturing contribute to developing a digital manufacturing ecosystem that enhances energy efficiency and resource utilization, manufacturing processes are vulnerable to timely production and delivery. The digital manufacturing systems in Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) minimized the human-technology interactions to foster productivity and material flow. However, there is scarce research to gauge the efficiency of these digital technologies in the entire manufacturing process; also, little is known about the collaborative efforts among countries to achieve sustainable manufacturing performance through the digitalization of the production process. Thus, this systematic review aimed to highlight the effectiveness of the digital manufacturing systems for sustainable product development and the collaborative research on the subject. We selected 52 research articles for this review by following the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) statement. The literature classifications were developed using text frequency algorithms in VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands) Results exposed literature from 2005 to 2020 can be categorized into four major research streams: digital transformation, digital manufacturing ecosystem, performance management, and sustainability. The study's findings revealed that the manufacturing processes are moving towards the IoT, digital devices, and smart factories that are entirely dependent on digital technologies. The digital manufacturing ecosystem is dependent on the availability of digital technologies to all stakeholders. The study concluded that digital technologies are improving manufacturing efficiency and process effectiveness. However, this requires infrastructure that primarily available in developed countries; thus, the digital transformation in underdeveloped regions is deliberate and requires more collaborative research.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - INFECTIOUS-DISEASE
KW  - DEFINITION
KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Marine mammals are often cited as "sentinels of ocean health" yet accessible, synthesized data on their health changes that could effectively warn of ocean health changes are rare. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature addressing blockchain technology (BT) in general management and economics (GME). Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review methodology is used to collect and analyze the literature. Findings Three clusters of research are identified, namely, law, economy and innovation. The use of BT in law areas fosters the registration of intellectual property (IP) rights, although conflict between some of BT applications and regulatory frameworks is present. Research on cryptocurrencies is of high interest to the economy today. In the innovation cluster, BT improves security, traceability and transparency in operations over supply chains. However, BT has many technical imperfections that hinder its wide adoption. Furthermore, the need for the full commitment of all business actors complicates its implementation. Research on BT is still at a nascent stage. Conceptual papers dominate the literature (18 theories are discussed). Eight main future research directions are described. For example, the relationship between the use of BT in supply chains and competitive advantage is not established; and quality standards for BT platforms are not developed. Research limitations/implications The review is restricted to academic journals in the fields of GME, which limits the extent of the conclusions. Originality/value The paper synthesizes 47 studies published in academic journals, avoiding misleading claims and inaccurate information insofar as possible; and provides a spectrum of descriptive statistics and qualitative meta-synthesis analysis of the current literature.

AB  - Background: According to the prediction of the Food and Agriculture Organization, food supply must increase by almost 70 percent by 2050, with tremendous consequences in terms of land depletion, natural resource use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The current agri-food system is incapable to cope with this raising demand meanwhile preserving the environment. There is urgent need to reorient the food system onto a more sustainable trajectory: producers should pursue more conscious and environmentally friendly practices and consumers should account for sustainability issues while making their daily food consumption decisions.
   Scope and approach: The goal of this systematic review is to gather existing evidence on green nudging interventions geared at leveraging more environmentally sustainable behaviours among the agents of the food chain, from the producers to the final consumers. An extensive literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, EconLit, and CAB Abstracts, restricting the selection to the last ten years, and using "nudg*" or "choice architecture" as primary research strings. Finally, 25 studies were included in the review.
   Key finding and conclusions: Almost all studies on farmers as well as on consumers included in this review provide evidence that green nudging can be effective in leveraging more sustainable practices. Overall, we propose that green nudges should not be meant to replace stricter environmental and food policies, but rather they should be regarded as potential complements to be implemented with the aim of gradually moving society in a direction that might benefit all.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated cardiovascular health effects of environmental noise exposure, partly showing different effect estimates for males and females. This cannot be explained by biological differences between males and females alone. It is assumed that health outcomes and exposure patterns also depend on gender, determined by social, economic, and cultural factors in society. This systematic review evaluated the current state of how sex/gender is integrated in studies on environmental noise associated with hypertension, blood pressure, and ischemic heart diseases. A systematic literature search was conducted in three different databases, identifying thirty studies published between 1 January 2000 and 2 February 2020. Effects varied, with no consistent findings for both males and females. All studies used a binary operationalization of sex/gender, assuming static differences between males and females. The differentiation between biological and social dimensions of sex/gender was not present in any of the studies and the terms "sex" and "gender" were used interchangeably. However, biological and social dimensions of sex/gender were unconsciously taken up in the discussion of the results. Integrating sex/gender-theoretical concepts into future studies offers great potential to increase the validity of research findings, thus making them more useful for prevention efforts, health promotion, and health care.

AB  - Objectives: Many researchers have studied the effectiveness of school-based physical activity (PA) interventions in promoting children's PA; yet, much remains unknown about best practices for promoting PA in diverse populations of school-aged US children. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of elementary school-based PA interventions on children's PA levels in minority or underserved populations. Methods: Studies were identified through a systematic search of electronic databases, related references, and additional sources. Inclusion criteria included US-based randomized controlled trials with validated instruments and scales. Results: A total of 10 publications met the inclusion criteria. Included studies had varying settings (classroom, playground, etc), study population sizes, and durations. Five of the 10 interventions, including all of the classroom-based interventions, were effective, and the others were equivocal. The effective PA interventions were well-planned and were implemented with fidelity to achieve sustainable results. Conclusion: Overall, classroom-based interventions improve the PA level of elementary-school age children. The lack of uniformity and fidelity in implementation across interventions limits the interpretation of the findings. Although we conducted a comprehensive search, only 10 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, indicating a critical need for more research in this area.

AB  - Cortisol monitoring in the agri-food sector is considered a valuable tool due to its direct correlation with growth, reproduction, the immune system, and overall animal welfare. Strategies to monitor this stress hormone and its correlation to food quality and security have been studied in fish farming and the livestock industry. This review discusses studies on monitoring cortisol in the food industry for the first time. The impact of cortisol on animal production, quality, and the security of food products, and the analytical procedures commonly implemented for sample pre-concentration and quantification by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, are reviewed and discussed according to the results published in the period 2012-2022. Aquaculture, or fish farming, is the leading agri-food sector, where cortisol's impact and usefulness are better known than in livestock. The determination of cortisol in fish not only allows for an increase in the production rate, but also the ability to monitor the water quality, enhancing the sustainable development of this industry. In cattle, further studies are needed since it has mainly been used to detect the administration of illicit substances. Current analytical control and monitoring techniques are expensive and often depend on invasive sampling, not allowing fast or real-time monitoring.

AB  - The introduction of non-native freshwater fish is a primary cause of aquatic biodiversity loss at global scale. Such introductions have a severe impact on freshwater ecosystems in terms of competition, predation, habitat alteration, genetic pollution and transmission of diseases and parasites. A systematic review was conducted on the helminths parasites of freshwater fish in the context of species introduction and a total of 199 publications were retrieved between 1969 and November 2022. Several scenarios may arise when a new fish species arrive in a recipient area. Non-native fish hosts can co-introduce their parasites without transmitting them to native fish (e.g., the case of North American Centrarchidae and their Monogenea parasites). Another possible outcome is the transfer of these parasites to the native fish fauna (spillover, e.g., the cases of the Nematoda Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara, Niimi & Itagaki, 1974 and the Monogenea Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957). Reciprocally, non-native fish hosts may acquire parasites in their new distribution range whether these parasites are native or were previously introduced (e.g., the cases of Ponto-Caspian Gobiidae and the Chinese sleeper Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877). Acquired parasites can then be spilled back to the native fauna. This phenomenon is of particular interest when non-native fish hosts influence the dynamics of zoonotic parasites.

AB  - Sheep and goats are an important commodity for smallholder farmers across East Africa, but severe limitations remain in small ruminant production. This review aimed to identify specific constraints to small ruminant production and identify practical and sustainable solutions. From 54 eligible articles, most were focused in Ethiopia (n = 44) with only 6 studies performed in Tanzania and 4 in Uganda. The most frequently identified constraint in Ethiopia and Tanzania was disease (n = 28 and n = 3, respectively), and in Uganda, it was the lack of access to veterinary services (n = 4). Additionally, access to good breeding stock, lack of animal records, and an established marketing chain were also mentioned in all the three countries. Ectoparasites, gastrointestinal parasites, orf, and sheep/goat pox were the most frequently mentioned disease challenges causing productivity losses. Many articles provided potential solutions as suggested by farmers, including improved access to veterinary services and medicines, improved record keeping, and access to good breeding stock. Farmers highlighted the value of community-based participatory development plans to increase education on disease control, land management, and husbandry. This review also highlighted knowledge gaps, the need for further research, particularly in Tanzania and Uganda, and the importance of addressing multiple challenges holistically due to the links between constraints.

AB  - Q-methodology is a mixed qualitative-quantitative method used to measure social perspectives on issues relating to sustainability and environmental governance in a systematic, replicable manner. Although its use grown over the past two decades, to date there has not been a comprehensive review of the environmental sustainability Q-methodology literature. Using bibliometric analysis and systematic review, this paper examines the rapid growth in published Q-methodology research on sustainable natural resource management and environmental governance. We analysed and iteratively coded 277 empirical Q-studies published between 2000-2018 to establish research trends, shared gaps, and best practices among environmental social science Q-researchers. We also conducted co-authorship and co-citation analyses to identify research clusters using Q-methodology. We find that, while Q-methodology uses a relatively standardized protocol, considerable heterogeneity persists across such domains as study design, p-set identification, concourse and Q-set development, analysis and interpretation. Further, we identify major reporting gaps among Q methodology publications where researchers do not fully describe or justify subjective decision-making throughout the research process. The paper ends with recommendations for improving research reporting and increasing the circulation and uptake of up-to-date Q-methodology practices and innovations.

AB  - Nature's contributions to people (NCP) rarely originate from nature alone. Often, only by joining natural capital with forms of anthropogenic capital, NCP emerge benefitting people. Understanding how NCP are co-produced by natural and anthropogenic capitals is needed to inform decision-making on sustainable land-use practices. Through a systematic review of the literature, we compile existing empirical evidence on NCP co-production and how this evidence was arrived at. We identified 237 observations from 25 publications on anthropogenic capital indicators co-producing NCP. The reviewed studies were conducted mainly in cropland and forest ecosystems and at the landscape level. Our results show that most evidence for co-production exists for material NCP, with physical capital and/or human capital as main input. Interestingly, non-material NCP relied mostly on human or social capital only, while material and regulating NCP involved multiple types of anthropogenic capital. Our findings provide guidance for future research on how to explicitly incorporate NCP co-production to analytically assess the relationships between anthropogenic capitals and NCP provision.

AB  - Plants differ widely in their ability to find tolerable climatic ranges through seed dispersal, depending on their life-history traits and habitat characteristics. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review on seed dispersal mechanisms was conducted to elucidate plant seed movements amid changing environments. Here, the highest relative count of studies was found in Spain (16.47%), followed by Brazil (14.12%), and the USA (14.12%). The megadiverse, hotspot countries (e.g., Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, and Indonesia) and Africa (Tanzania, South Africa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) have very low to no data about the reviewed topic. The effects of land use changes, habitat degradation/disturbances, climate, and extreme weather conditions on seed dispersal mechanisms and agents had the highest share of studies across topics and countries. Plant diversity and distribution of anemochorous, endozoochorous, epizoochorous, hydrochorous, myrmecochorous, and ornithochorous species are seriously affected by changing environments due to altered long-distance seed dispersal. The fruit types commonly associated with endozoochory and ornithochory are species with achene, capsule, drupe, fleshy, and nut fruits/seeds, whereas achene, capsule, samara/winged seeds are associated with anemochory. The present review provides a summary of evidence on how plants are affected by climate change as populations of dispersal vectors decline. Finally, recommendations for further study were made based on the identified knowledge gaps.

AB  - Making cities sustainable is a global commitment. Achieving sustainability in cities demands novel, integrative, and innovative approaches that enable communities to collaboratively anticipate, envision, and negotiate futures and enhance opportunities for sustainable action. Participatory futuring is a promising approach to drive urban sustainability; however, it can take many forms and insights are fragmented across multiple fields, creating an incomplete understanding. This systematic literature review aims to shed light on the existing forms of participatory futuring for urban sustainability and identify potential research directions. Our study identifies how existing research revolves around three forms of participatory futuring, i.e., 1) interdisciplinary expert-driven scenario-building, 2) quadruple-helix futuring informing policy agendas, and 3) public futuring for social learning.

AB  - The concept of resilience' has recently gained traction in a range of contexts. Its various interpretations and framings are now used to examine a variety of issues, particularly relating to the human dimensions of global change. This can pose challenges to scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers seeking to develop focused research programmes, design targeted interventions, and communicate across disciplinary boundaries. The concept of resilience is widely used in Aotearoa-New Zealand, where it informs both government policy and research programmes. Resilience is particularly relevant in this small developed nation, which is heavily reliant on primary production in rural areas and affected by a range of geological and climatic hazards. To understand the range and extent of application of resilience in the rural context, we use systematic review methods to identify, characterise, and synthesise this knowledge base. Currently, research applying the concept of resilience in the rural context is limited in areal extent, largely quantitative in nature, and led by a small number of researchers. There is limited evidence of collaboration. Research has focused on a small number of hazards, failing to capture the diversity of risks and hazards in addition to their impacts. The results of our analysis and methodology offer important insights for meta-analyses of risk and hazard scholarship. The findings provide a baseline to track the future progress and effectiveness of resilience interventions and help inform current and future research priorities targeting persistent vulnerabilities in rural New Zealand and elsewhere.

AB  - This study aims to consolidate the available knowledge on gender diversity and its impact on the dual performance (social and financial) of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). We specifically focus on MFIs due to their distinctive nature compared to other industries, being traditionally women-centered and having a substantial representation of women employees across all levels of the corporate hierarchy. To conduct this comprehensive analysis, we employed a systematic review approach, meticulously selecting 24 relevant papers from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Our findings revealed that research on gender diversity in MFIs primarily focuses on the board level. However, existing studies present conflicting results, suggesting that the impact of gender diversity on MFI performance is nuanced and complex. This complexity stems largely from the varying roles women play within the organizational structure. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the influence of additional factors, such as the database used, the study's context, and its geographical location, on the reported outcomes. Notably, research on gender diversity at the managerial and loan officer levels remains scarce, presenting a significant gap in the current body of knowledge. To further illuminate this field, this study identifies the most influential papers on the topic of gender diversity in microfinance. Additionally, we provide a co-authorship network analysis, visualizing the connections between existing research. This analysis provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research endeavors in this critical area.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review was conducted to synthesize the existing evidence regarding key considerations influencing African Americans' participation in cancer clinical trials (CCTs).
   Methods: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications during the last decade (2002-2011) that met our inclusionary criteria. Our search utilized Boolean combinations of the following terms: "clinical trial"; "cancer"; "neoplasm"; "African American"; "Black"; "caregiver"; "decision making"; "recruitment"; "companion"; "family"; "significant other"; and "social support".
   Results: A total of 267 articles were identified in the database searches. Of these articles, a total of 31 were determined to meet the inclusion criteria and were retained for review. Key issues that emerged as impediments to a successful recruitment of African Americans to CCTs included negative attitudes towards clinical trials, low levels of knowledge and awareness regarding CCTs, religious beliefs, and structural barriers, such as transportation, childcare, and access to health care. Recommendations from physicians, family members, and friends may promote CCT participation. Multimedia, and culturally-appropriate recruitment approaches may also be effective in soliciting participation among African Americans.
   Conclusion: Existing research underscores the importance of social support from family and friends, cultural appropriateness and sensitivity from physicians and in the design of the CCT, and enhanced education among African Americans in decision-making processes. As African Americans are underrepresented in CCTs, targeted strategies to enhance recruitment efforts and improve cancer treatment outcomes are essential. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The increase in frequency and intensity of urban flooding is a global challenge. Flooding directly impacts residents of industrialized cities with aging combined sewer systems, as well as cities with less centralized infrastructure to manage stormwater, fecal sludge, and wastewater. Green infrastructure is growing in popularity as a sustainable strategy to mimic nature-based flood management. Although its technical performance has been extensively studied, little is known about the effects of green stormwater infrastructure on human health and social well-being.
   Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature on the effects of green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management on individuals', households', and communities' a) physical health; b) mental health; c) economic well-being; and d) flood resilience and social acceptance of green infrastructure. We systematically searched databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; the first 300 results in Google Scholar; and websites of key organizations including the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Study quality and strength of evidence was assessed for included studies, and descriptive data were extracted for a narrative summary.
   Results: Out of 21,213 initial results, only 18 studies reported health or social well-being outcomes. Seven of these studies used primary data, and none allowed for causal inference. No studies connected green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management to mental or physical health outcomes. Thirteen studies were identified on economic outcomes, largely reporting a positive association between green infrastructure and property values. Five studies assessed changes in perceptions about green infrastructure, but with mixed results. Nearly half of all included studies were from Portland, Oregon.
   Conclusions: This global systematic review highlights the minimal evidence on human health and social well-being relating to green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management. To enable scale-up of this type of infrastructure to reduce flooding and improve ecological and human well-being, widespread acceptance of green infrastructure will be essential. Policymakers and planners need evidence on the full range of benefits from different contexts to enable financing and implementation of instfrastructure options, especially in highly urbanized, flood-prone settings around the world. Therefore, experts in social science, public health, and program evaluation must be integrated into interdisciplinary green infrastructure research to better relate infrastructure design to tangible human outcomes.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and specifically SDG 2, commit the international community to achieve zero hunger by 2030 through a renewed focus on agricultural development for food security and nutrition. This paper presents a systematic review of published evidence of contributions by agricultural sector interventions to food security, including indicators and success factors.
   Our literature screening yielded a sample of 66 publications with 73 single or multiple intervention evaluations. Of these, 38 (52%) used a direct food security indicator to measure food security impacts, and the rest used a proxy indicator. Of the 73 evaluations, 49 (67%) resulted in positive impacts on food security, 17 (23%) produced no measurable impacts and 7 (10%) led to negative impacts. Interventions studied included input subsidies, extension services and value chain enhancements, delivered either alone or together, and sometimes with specific complementary pro-poor features. Studies showed positive, neutral or even negative food security outcomes across all intervention types, suggesting that program design features may be more important than the type of intervention in determining impact on food security. Positive food security outcomes were shown to be linked to multiple complementary interventions, targeted pro-poor support features, responsiveness to local food security issues, community engagement and collaboration with local and regional institutions. We suggest methods for improving monitoring, evaluation and learning related to the food security impacts of agriculture sector interventions in order to contribute to SDG 2.1.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the road sector have attracted increasing attention in current years. This paper attempted to provide a systematic review of the existing research efforts on road life-cycle CO2 emissions by analyzing the system's boundary division, identifying the CO2 emission contributions of each life-cycle phase, listing major emission contributors, exploring related emission reduction technologies, and giving directions for future development. The research showed that the road life cycle is usually divided into five phases: material production, construction, use, maintenance and end-of-life (EOL) phases. The use phase and the initial construction stage (including material production and construction phases) contributed the most CO2 emissions during the road life cycle. In detail, the production of cement, asphalt and steel were the three main emission con-tributors in the material production phase. The pavement roughness, albedo, and concrete carbonation were the main factors affecting emissions in the use phase. In addition, emission reduction technologies such as using recycled materials and recycling tech-niques, lowering mixing temperature, and equipment energy substitution were commonly used to reduce emissions from material production and construction phases. The appli-cation of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage, carbon sink, and the use of hydrogen, solar and photovoltaic in the road sector may have emission reduction potentials and should be highlighted more in future studies.(c) 2022 Periodical Offices of Chang'an University.

AB  - Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.

AB  - Female education in China is an over-researched area, yet it does not provide enough evidence on the country's exact pattern of female education practice. On the one hand, the National Plan of 2010-2020 emphasises equal education policies regardless of gender type. On the other hand, reported research raises several gendered and procedural yet substantive practices of female education in China. Thus, it was essential to conduct this study to inform policymakers, practitioners and researchers on the status of this area, based on a systematic review of 47 eligible included studies conducted between 2009 and 2020, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed designs. The review answers two questions: (1) What are the substantive findings of qualitative synthesis on gender equity of female education in China? (2) Regardless of the existence or absence of gender inequity, what patterns of female education exist, and what kind of framework or model could be proposed to reform female education in China? The PRISMA guideline and SPIDER tool were used to conduct and report this study. The practical theory was also used-proposing a model that may serve to diagnose as well as intervene in the conflict of female education equity in China. Findings and conclusions showed that both gender equity and gender inequity are disadvantageous at short-term and long-term levels. For this reason, relativism might help to reduce the impact of these two patterns. While cultural and social capital is still the main impacting factor on gender equity in any country, reform should take place. Relativism could be achieved through reasonable understanding and interpretation of the sources that form the cultural and social capital. It takes place also by preventing the causes of gender gaps. These include over-interpretation and under-interpretation of gender roles, mainly those which are female. Gender should never be used as a factor in human capital.

AB  - Background Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems play a key role in upholding human rights and generating data for health and good governance. They also can help monitor progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although many countries have made substantial progress in strengthening their CRVS systems, most low- and middle-income countries still have underdeveloped systems. The objective of this systematic review is to identify national policies that can help countries strengthen their systems. Methods and findings The ABI/INFORM, Embase, JSTOR, PubMed, and WHO Index Medicus databases were systematically searched for policies to improve birth and/or death registration on 24 January 2017. Global stakeholders were also contacted for relevant grey literature. For the purposes of this review, policies were categorised as supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches). Quantitative results on changes in vital event registration rates were presented for individual comparative articles. Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative syntheses on operational considerations encompassing acceptability to recipients and staff, human resource requirements, information technology or infrastructure requirements, costs to the health system, unintended effects, facilitators, and barriers. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018085768. Thirty-five articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration were identified. Although 25 countries representing all global regions (Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean) were reflected, there were limited countries from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Twenty-four articles reported policy effects on birth and/or death registration. Twenty-one of the 24 articles found that the change in registration rate after the policy was positive, with two supply and one penalty articles being the exceptions. The qualitative syntheses identified 15 operational considerations across all policy categories. Human and financial resource requirements were not quantified. The primary limitation of this systematic review was the threat of publication bias wherein many countries may not have documented their experience; this threat is most concerning for policies that had neutral or negative effects. Conclusions Our systematic review suggests that combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates in different geographical contexts. Operational considerations should be interpreted based on health system, governance, and sociocultural context. More evaluations and research are needed from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Further research and evaluation are also needed to estimate the human and financial resource requirements required for different policies.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems generate foundational data for governance across sectors. Within public health, birth and death registrations are critical not only for empowering individuals' legal rights and for access to services but also in estimating health service needs, coverage, and impact. To our knowledge, no formal evidence review and synthesis has characterised which policies work and which do not for strengthening birth and death registration. What did the researchers do and find? We searched five literature databases and contacted global stakeholders to identify policies that improve birth and/or death registration and presented policy quantitative effects and qualitative syntheses. We identified 35 articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration from 25 countries representing all global regions. Twenty-four articles reported supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches) effects on birth and/or death registration. Combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates across different geographical contexts. What do these findings mean? Countries interested in strengthening their CRVS systems may need to consider a combination of multiple policy approaches based on their health system, governance, and sociocultural context. Although this review and synthesis successfully identified many quantitative and qualitative data to strengthen CRVS systems, more policy evaluations and research are needed on effects from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions and on human and financial resource requirements globally. Publication bias may have led investigators with neutral or negative findings to not document their findings; further research and evaluation is needed to understand which policies do not work.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is a highly prevalent, harmful, and aversive experience which is fundamentally subjective: social isolation alone cannot account for loneliness, and people can experience loneliness even with ample social connections. A number of studies have qualitatively explored experiences of loneliness; however, the research lacks a comprehensive overview of these experiences. We present a protocol for a study that will, for the first time, systematically review and synthesise the qualitative literature on experiences of loneliness in people of all ages from the general, non-clinical population. The aim is to offer a fine-grained look at experiences of loneliness across the lifespan.
   Methods: We will search multiple electronic databases from their inception onwards: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, Child Development & Adolescent Studies, Sociological s, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, CINAHL, and the Education Resource Information Center. Sources of grey literature will also be searched. We will include empirical studies published in English including any qualitative study design (e.g. interview, focus group). Studies should focus on individuals from non-clinical populations of any age who describe experiences of loneliness. All citations, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened by one author with a second author ensuring consistency regarding inclusion. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Thematic synthesis will be used to synthesise this literature, and study quality will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. The planned review will be reported according to the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement.
   Discussion: The growing body of research on loneliness predictors, outcomes, and interventions must be grounded in an understanding of the lived experience of loneliness. This systematic review and thematic synthesis will clarify how loneliness is subjectively experienced across the lifespan in the general population. This will allow for a more holistic understanding of the lived experience of loneliness which can inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers working in this important area.

AB  - Purpose - Sustainability has been the subject of several scientific investigations. Many researchers in the construction industry have also examined a range of sustainability-related studies. However, few studies have thoroughly reviewed implementing sustainability concepts in high-rise residential buildings (HRRBs).
   Design/methodology/approach - By adopting scientometrics and systematic review (SR), this study seeks to map out recent sustainability trends and concepts in the design, development and operation of HRRBs worldwide and in Hong Kong. With a focus on bibliographic records from the Web of Science (WoS) database, 1,395 journal articles from 2013 to 2022 were analysed. Furthermore, thirteen studies were systematically reviewed.
   Findings - The SR indicated that sustainable practices in developing Hong Kong's HRRBs emphasised zero-carbon buildings, reduced energy usage and energy-efficient retrofitting. Likewise, terms such as BIM, urban density, life cycle assessment and system dynamics are strongly connected with clusters that include "residential buildings", "high-rise buildings" and "high-rise residential buildings". The study identified significant themes in establishing HRRBs by combining sustainable practices, emphasising urban governance and policy management, building performance and thermal comfort, energy and design optimisation, occupant behaviour and sensitivity analysis. Core sustainability ideas have improved resource management, air quality management and knowledge of user behaviour in HRRBs.
   Originality/value - The study allows researchers and practitioners to explore future research directions in the built environment per the application of sustainable concepts in the development of HRRBs from design, construction and post-construction phases.

AB  - Research attention for renewable energy controversies has been growing steadily. In studying such controversies, researchers have a tendency to focus on opponents, the public and local communities. There have been calls for some years now to broaden the scope of social science to include renewable energy technology (RET) actors such as project developers, governments or other actors involved in supporting or implementing renewable energy developments. Attention for RET actors is still limited and it is unclear where this area of research currently stands. Therefore, we present a systematic review of literature about RET actors in relation to controversies surrounding renewable energy technologies and infrastructure. The review of 89 publications shows two categories, consisting of eleven themes in total. The first category concerns RET actors' perceptions of the nature, impact and causes of public opposition, including specific groups of people and processes of engagement and decision-making. The second category describes different responses and strategies of RET actors to public opposition. Based on these findings, we present three observations about the current state of knowledge on RET actors and discuss implications for the broader field of renewable energy controversies. Future research should be directed at unravelling the diverse range of RET actors and their practices. This contributes to constructing a finer-grained understanding of the (development of) conflict dynamics between the actors engaged in controversies and action perspectives for the involved actors.

AB  - The future of humanity depends increasingly on the performance of cities. Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Lack of access to and use of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) cause 1.6 million deaths every year, of which 1.2 million are due to gastrointestinal illnesses like diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections like pneumonia. Poor WASH access and use also diminish nutrition and educational attainment, and cause danger and stress for vulnerable populations, especially for women and girls. The hardest hit regions are sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 calls for the end of open defecation, and universal access to safely managed water and sanitation facilities, and basic hand hygiene, by 2030. WASH access and use also underpin progress in other areas such as SDG1 poverty targets, SDG3 health and SDG4 education targets. Meeting the SDG equity agenda to "leave none behind" will require WASH providers prioritise the hardest to reach including those living remotely and people who are disadvantaged. Objectives Decision makers need access to high-quality evidence on what works in WASH promotion in different contexts, and for different groups of people, to reach the most disadvantaged populations and thereby achieve universal targets. The WASH evidence map is envisioned as a tool for commissioners and researchers to identify existing studies to fill synthesis gaps, as well as helping to prioritise new studies where there are gaps in knowledge. It also supports policymakers and practitioners to navigate the evidence base, including presenting critically appraised findings from existing systematic reviews. Methods This evidence map presents impact evaluations and systematic reviews from the WASH sector, organised according to the types of intervention mechanisms, WASH technologies promoted, and outcomes measured. It is based on a framework of intervention mechanisms (e.g., behaviour change triggering or microloans) and outcomes along the causal pathway, specifically behavioural outcomes (e.g., handwashing and food hygiene practices), ill-health outcomes (e.g., diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality), nutrition and socioeconomic outcomes (e.g., school absenteeism and household income). The map also provides filters to examine the evidence for a particular WASH technology (e.g., latrines), place of use (e.g., home, school or health facility), location (e.g., global region, country, rural and urban) and group (e.g., people living with disability). Systematic searches for published and unpublished literature and trial registries were conducted of studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Searches were conducted in March 2018, and searches for completed trials were done in May 2020. Coding of information for the map was done by two authors working independently. Impact evaluations were critically appraised according to methods of conduct and reporting. Systematic reviews were critically appraised using a new approach to assess theory-based, mixed-methods evidence synthesis. Results There has been an enormous growth in impact evaluations and systematic reviews of WASH interventions since the International Year of Sanitation, 2008. There are now at least 367 completed or ongoing rigorous impact evaluations in LMICs, nearly three-quarters of which have been conducted since 2008, plus 43 systematic reviews. Studies have been done in 83 LMICs, with a high concentration in Bangladesh, India, and Kenya. WASH sector programming has increasingly shifted in focus from what technology to supply (e.g.
   , a handwashing station or child's potty), to the best way in which to do so to promote demand. Research also covers a broader set of intervention mechanisms. For example, there has been increased interest in behaviour change communication using psychosocial "triggering", such as social marketing and community-led total sanitation. These studies report primarily on behavioural outcomes. With the advent of large-scale funding, in particular by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, there has been a substantial increase in the number of studies on sanitation technologies, particularly latrines. Sustaining behaviour is fundamental for sustaining health and other quality of life improvements. However, few studies have been done of intervention mechanisms for, or measuring outcomes on sustained adoption of latrines to stop open defaecation. There has also been some increase in the number of studies looking at outcomes and interventions that disproportionately affect women and girls, who quite literally carry most of the burden of poor water and sanitation access. However, most studies do not report sex disaggregated outcomes, let alone integrate gender analysis into their framework. Other vulnerable populations are even less addressed; no studies eligible for inclusion in the map were done of interventions targeting, or reporting on outcomes for, people living with disabilities. We were only able to find a single controlled evaluation of WASH interventions in a health care facility, in spite of the importance of WASH in health facilities in global policy debates. The quality of impact evaluations has improved, such as the use of controlled designs as standard, attention to addressing reporting biases, and adequate cluster sample size. However, there remain important concerns about quality of reporting. The quality and usefulness of systematic reviews for policy is also improving, which draw clearer distinctions between intervention mechanisms and synthesise the evidence on outcomes along the causal pathway. Adopting mixed-methods approaches also provides information for programmes on barriers and enablers affecting implementation. Conclusion Ensuring everyone has access to appropriate water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities is one of the most fundamental of challenges for poverty elimination. Researchers and funders need to consider carefully where there is the need for new primary evidence, and new syntheses of that evidence. This study suggests the following priority areas: Impact evaluations incorporating understudied outcomes, such as sustainability and slippage, of WASH provision in understudied places of use, such as health care facilities, and of interventions targeting, or presenting disaggregated data for, vulnerable populations, particularly over the life-course and for people living with a disability; Improved reporting in impact evaluations, including presentation of participant flow diagrams; and Synthesis studies and updates in areas with sufficient existing and planned impact evaluations, such as for diarrhoea mortality, ARIs, WASH in schools and decentralisation. These studies will preferably be conducted as mixed-methods systematic reviews that are able to answer questions about programme targeting, implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and compare alternative intervention mechanisms to achieve and sustain outcomes in particular contexts, preferably using network meta-analysis.

AB  - Alternative food networks (AFNs) are commonly defined by attributes of local production and short supply chains, which integrate dimensions of spatial and social proximity. This new form of food chain is emerging as a response to the crisis in conventional agribusiness. This article presents a systematic review of the academic literature on the alternative food network and short supply chain in order to understand the main elements and topics explored in the empirical studies conducted from 2014 to 2021. This review only considers research using a single or multiple case study approaches. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the literature search. The identification and eligibility processes were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) method. Six core topics were identified: motivation of actors; collaborative governance; social relations and trust; sustainability; boundary negotiation; and resilience. Most of the studies were developed in European countries. The results show that motivation to join the AFN and sustainability are the more explored topics, followed by the study of the different models of governance that characterize the AFN. In addition, the connection between different actors emerges, in a transversal manner, as an important pillar of AFNs. AFN features may change depending on social-economical, cultural, and geographical factors. There is therefore a need to explore other forms of AFNs; future research should conduct cross-analysis on AFNs in different countries and socio-economic contexts.

AB  - Purpose Intervention development guidelines suggest that behavioural interventions benefit from being theory-based. Minority populations typically benefit less from asthma self-management interventions, and the extent to which appropriate theory has been used for culturally tailored interventions has not been addressed. We aimed to determine theory use and theoretical domains targeted in asthma self-management interventions for South Asian and Black populations.
   Methods We systematically searched electronic databases, research registers, manually searched relevant journals and reference lists of reviews for randomised controlled trials of asthma self-management for South Asian and Black populations, and extracted data using the Theory Coding Scheme to inform if/how theory was used and explore its associations with asthma outcomes, and the Theoretical Domains Framework was used to identify targeted theoretical domains and its relationship to effectiveness of asthma outcomes.
   Results 20 papers (19 trials) were identified; theory was not extensively used in interventions. It was unclear whether theory use or theoretical domains targeted in interventions improved asthma outcomes. South Asian interventions included 'behavioural regulation', while 'reinforcement' was mostly used in African American interventions. 'Knowledge' was central for all populations, though there were differences related to 'environmental context and resources' e.g., language adaptations for South Asians; asthma resources provided for African Americans. Author descriptions of interventions targeting providers were limited.
   Conclusions There was little evidence of theory-based approaches used in cultural interventions for asthma self-management. Demystifying theoretical concepts (and cultural interpretations of constructs) may provide clarity for 'non-experts', enabling mainstream use of theory-driven approaches in intervention development.

AB  - Pesticides are widely used in global agriculture to achieve high productivity levels. Among them, fungicides are specifically designed to inhibit fungal growth in crops and seeds. However, their application often results in environmental contamination, as these chemicals can persistently be detected in surface waters. This poses a potential threat to non-target organisms, including humans, that inhabit the affected ecosystems. In toxicologic research, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is the most commonly used fish species to assess the potential effects of fungicide exposure, and numerous and sometimes conflicting findings have been reported. To address this, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the neurobehavioral effects of fungicides in zebrafish. Our search encompassed three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science), and the screening process followed predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. We extracted qualitative and quantitative data, as well as assessed reporting quality, from 60 included studies. Meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes of distance traveled in larvae and adults and spontaneous movements in embryos. The results revealed a significant overall effect of fungicide exposure on distance, with a lower distance traveled in the exposed versus control group. No significant effect was observed for spontaneous movements. The overall heterogeneity was high for distance and moderate for spontaneous movements. The poor reporting practices in the field hindered a critical evaluation of the studies. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis did not identify any studies skewing the meta-analyses. This review underscores the necessity for better-designed and reported experiments in this field.

AB  - AimHuman impacts on the biosphere are a matter of urgent and growing concern, with ecologists increasingly being asked to project biodiversity futures. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is likely to comprehensively assess such projections, yet despite being widely used and potentially critical tools for analysing socio-environmental futures, integrated assessment models (IAMs) have received little attention from ecological modellers. We aim to raise awareness and understanding of IAMs among ecologists by describing the structure and composition of IAMs, assessing their utility for biodiversity projections and identifying limitations that hamper greater interaction between scientists using IAMs and those using ecological models. We also hope to inspire more accessible and applicable models by suggesting development needs for IAMs.
   MethodsWe conduct a systematic review of four state-of-the-art IAMs, which describes and contrasts key model features and analyses six aspects of IAMs that are of fundamental interest to ecologists.
   ConclusionsIAMs could be valuable for modelling biodiversity futures; however, current IAMs were not developed for this application and challenges remain for ecologists looking to use their outputs. Separating and understanding the differences resulting from IAM formulation and those resulting from specific scenario assumptions is currently problematic, and current IAMs may be unable to accurately represent environmental conditions for both Earth-system projections and for building robust models of biodiversity because key ecological processes are absent. We suggest that model intercomparisons would identify differences in model dynamics, and detailed studies of how dynamical interactions between components influence behaviour would address why such differences arise. Bio-economic fisheries models and agriculture pollination models provide starting points for integrating key ecological feedbacks within IAMs. Ultimately, making IAMs more accessible within the multidisciplinary study of global change, drawing on user-centred research, would enable more resolved, reliable and accurate assessment of how Earth's socio-ecological system is approaching planetary boundaries.

AB  - Environmental problems demand for innovative interdisciplinary research to tackle problem complexity and provide insights for problem-solving. Along these lines, behavioral insights have the potential to improve the effectiveness of policies by identifying which behaviors are best tackled and how. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature on small-scale farmers' pesticide use in the Global South to identify (a) pesticide use behaviors and (b) their behavioral determinants. We defined our body of literature by establishing inclusion criteria and screened studies in a two-step process involving multiple coders. From the selected studies (k = 70), we extracted data about farmers' pesticide use behaviors. We also extracted the determinants of these behaviors with an established framework of behavioral change, the behavior change wheel. Finally, we show how the behavioral insights thus obtained can provide hypotheses on the suitability and ultimate effectiveness of policy instruments for agriculture and environmental protection. Overall, this systematic approach showcases how behavioral insights can be used to systematically gather new knowledge on what works and why in pesticide policy. Additionally, this paper illustrates that the current literature on pesticide use behavior in the Global South lacks standardized and consistent measures of behavior and determinants to provide valid and robust results. Overall, this hampers evidence synthesis and thus scientific progress in the field.

AB  - Psychological treatments are recognised as generally effective for chronic pain. However, little is known about the evidence for psychological treatments for chronic pain in Asia.
   This study aimed (1) to identify all treatment outcome studies in the area of psychological approaches to chronic pain in adult populations of East Asia and Southeast Asia and (2) to evaluate the treatment types, the evidence for treatment outcomes and research design quality with regard to these studies.
   We identified all psychologically based treatment outcome studies for chronic pain in East and Southeast Asia by searching CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE (via Ovid), Global Health and Web of Science from the beginning of each abstracting service until December 2014 (week 4).
   Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria including a total of N = 1,890 participants. Four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), five controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and eight cohort studies. Treatment outcomes included pain, disability, depression and anxiety. Overall, the studies included in this review showed small to medium within-group effect sizes for all four outcomes. A majority of the studies were rated as weak in design quality. Three RCTs were found to be of strong quality, one of moderate quality and only one CCT of moderate quality.
   The current available literature on psychological treatments for chronic pain in East and Southeast Asia is generally small in scale, mostly preliminary and lags behind on some developments occurring in North America and Europe. Further development of treatment methods and research designs is warranted.

AB  - Increased environmental concerns have prompted organizations, businesses and countries to act sustainably to accomplish sustainable development goals. Hence, research on Green Banking (GR-banking) has gained popularity as researchers have shown a significant interest in identifying the factors that promote the adoption of GR-banking. Considering Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this study reviews the articles related to GR-banking adoption or intention until April 2022. The underlying objective is to analyse the studies related to GR-banking adoption or intention, research methodologies and assess the theoretical frameworks used in GR-banking adoption or intention studies. The articles were extracted through a comprehensive key search strategy from the Scopus database and Google Scholar until April 2022. The survey identified only 51 articles that directly addressed GR-banking adoption or intention, indicating a significant knowledge deficit in this field. Empirical studies on GR-banking adoption are relatively higher in number than theoretical studies. Results of this study provide key details on both empirical and theoretical studies and highlight the areas for future studies. The study further highlights that the research on GR-banking adoption or intention is in its infancy, and limited two-dimensional studies have been conducted on GR-banking adoption or intention. Moreover, current studies have not investigated performance outcomes of GR-banking besides exploring a few theories. This study offers multiple insights and identifies important research areas that need to be explored in the future to enhance sustainability and related practices in the banking industry.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Wild.) is a drought and salinity-tolerant crop that originated in the Andes over 7000 years ago. It is adapted to different agroecological areas and can be grown from sea level to an altitude of 4000 m. The outstanding nutritional status of quinoa, with its high content of proteins, vitamins, and minerals, makes it a promising crop able to combat hunger and malnutrition in different countries in the 21st century. Quinoa cultivation has expanded from South America to Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. Reviewing quinoa cropping practices will provide farmers with adequate recommendations for improving the agronomic and environmental sustainability of quinoa cultivation worldwide. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review of agronomic management practices in 148 field experiments conducted worldwide from 2000 to 2022. The collected data from the literature were analyzed and presented by location to determine high-performing genotypes, optimal planting dates, and other adequate cropping practices affecting quinoa performance and yield. Results showed that quinoa could be successfully cultivated in the new farming areas. Quinoa yields were higher than those reported in its place of origin, ranging from 108 kg ha(-1), obtained by KU-2 in Washington State, to 9667 kg ha(-1), obtained by Longli in China. Although quinoa is considered a crop with low input requirements, positive grain yield response was observed following increasing fertilization rates. Quinoa needs 2 to 4.6 kg of nitrogen to produce 1q of grain yield. In terms of phosphorus and potassium, quinoa needs 3.7 kg P2O5 and 4.3 kg K2O to produce 1 ton of total biomass. Quinoa has low water requirements (300-400 mm). However, a positive response was recorded with water quantities up to 866 mm. During our investigation, weed control in quinoa crop is still undeveloped and usually done manually. Research addressing this issue can increase quinoa yields and decrease the production cost. Downey mildew and birds' attack are the major phytosanitary problems affecting quinoa grain yield. Other pests such as miners and aphids can also affect the health of quinoa, but their injury is not a serious problem. After the harvest, saponins found in the out layer of the seed can be removed through washing and mechanical pearling process, but the latter technic was found to be efficient and cost effective to reduce the saponin content. Our results constitute the first recommendation base for the adequate worldwide agronomic practices of quinoa crop.

AB  - The development of easily observable measures of restoration success is essential for monitoring of the ambitious proposed global restoration targets (e.g. The Bonn Challenge; New York Declaration on Forests). Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are a good way to evaluate the performance of different organisms in the monitoring of ecological restoration. Among the arthropods, ants have a long history in environmental monitoring. We compiled a data set and performed a global meta-analysis encompassing studies conducted in different ecosystems around the world to investigate whether richness and composition of species or functional groups (FG) of ant communities can be predicted during the restoration process. Moreover, we aimed to understand the influence of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration processes. Notwithstanding the varied conditions in which the studies were carried out, our meta-analysis showed that reestablishment of ant FG takes place more quickly than species richness. The recovery of ant diversity is faster in tropical ecosystems and areas under natural regeneration can have higher ant diversity than the reference areas. In temperate ecosystems, mined areas under restoration are less likely to recover the number of species than FG richness. Both species and FG composition were less predictable in our meta-analysis. As the publication of new datasets is increasing, we hope that future meta-analyses can build on the present study to further describe and understand the patterns in ant communities to be used as indicators of ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Climate change is already having adverse impacts on ecosystems, communities and economic activities through higher temperatures, prolonged droughts, and more frequent extremes. However, a gap remains between public understanding, scientific knowledge about climate change, and changes in behaviour to effect adaptation. 'Serious games'-games used for purposes other than entertainment-are one way to reduce this adaptation deficit by enhancing opportunities for social learning and enabling positive action. Games can provide communities with the opportunity to interactively explore different climate futures, build capability and capacity for dealing with complex challenges, and socialise adaptation priorities with diverse publics. Using systematic review methods, this paper identifies, reviews, synthesises and assesses the literature on serious games for climate change adaptation. To determine where and how impact is achieved, we draw on an evaluation framework grounded in social learning, to assess which combinations of cognitive (knowledge and thinking), normative (norms and approaches) and relational (how people connect and network building) learning are achieved. Results show that factors influencing the overall success in influencing behaviour and catalysing learning for adaptation include generating high levels of interand intra-level trust between researchers, practitioners and community participants; strong debriefing and evaluation practices; and the use of experienced and knowledgeable facilitators. These results can help inform future game design, and research methodologies to develop robust ways for engaging with stakeholders and end users, and enhance learning effects for resilient climate futures.

AB  - Marjolin's ulcer (MU) is a rare, aggressive entity with frequent delay in diagnosis for a variety of regions. Although well described and classically taught in medical school, aspects of its treatment remain ill-defined and controversial. A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify studies discussing patients who underwent surgical treatment of MU. A total of 31 papers, reporting on 1016 patients, were included. Burns were the most common etiology of malignant degeneration (68%), followed by trauma. The lower extremity was most affected (51%) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found in 94% of cases, with the majority being well differentiated. Basal cell carcinoma and melenoma composed a minority of cases. Melanoma occurred more frequently in previously skin grafted wounds and had a higher rate of metastases than SCC. Most patients did not have associated regional or distant metastases present at diagnosis. Wide local excision (71%) was performed in most cases, unless amputation was indicated for severe disease or bone involvement. Lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were variably reported, with conflicting evidence on the efficacy. Lymphadenectomy was most commonly indicated for known lymph node involvement. In cases of metastatic disease chemotherapy and radiation were used in conjunction with surgical treatment. Despite numerous articles on this topic, controversy remains in the management of MU. Early diagnosis of suspicious chronic wounds and prompt surgical intervention remains imperative to its treatment.

AB  - Digital technologies ranging from biosensors to virtual reality have revolutionized the healthcare landscape by offering innovations that hold great promise in addressing the challenges posed by rapidly aging populations. To optimize healthcare experiences for older people, it is crucial to understand their user experience (UX) with digital health technologies. This systematic review, covering articles published from 2013 to 2023, aimed to explore frequently used questionnaires for assessing digital healthcare UX among older people. The inclusion criteria were original studies assessing UX in digital health for individuals aged >= 65 years. Of 184 articles identified, 17 were selected after rigorous screening. The questionnaires used included the System Usability Scale (SUS), the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire. Customized questionnaires based on models such as the Technology Acceptance Model and the Almere model were developed in some studies. Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness in assessing digital health UX among older people, the SUS emerged as the go-to tool (52.9%). Combining the SUS with the UEQ provided comprehensive insights into UX. Specialized questionnaires were also used, but further research is needed to validate and adapt these tools for diverse cultural contexts and evolving technologies.

AB  - A review of the literature provides empirical evidence that companies use water accounting (WA) to address water shortages and water management issues. Our systematic review suggests two key points: first, phenomena such as water shortages and freshwater scarcity are no longer limited to less developed areas in Asia. Developed economies may also experience a water crisis. Second, in view of the increased pressure from stakeholders, there is a growing tendency amongst firms to manage risks around water as a resource and to implement rigid control of water consumption.

AB  - The interactions between unemployment and health create a need for specific interventions for health promotion and prevention. This overview provides information on how health promotion for the unemployed has been approached with an analysis of controlled intervention studies between 1996 and 2016. The literature search consulted 11 international databases in medicine, social sciences and psychology. A total of 30 health interventions for the unemployed were identified, with 43 articles that included the effects of intervention. A controlled-study design was used in 14 studies. The health promotion measures were generally based on individual counselling, case management, training or group services. The overview demonstrates the breadth of variation in target groups and types of measures. Their result indicators for health and integration into the labor market vary substantially, as do the employment promotion effects. There is evidence of improved health and labor market integration for established approaches like the JOBS Program and JobFit. Effects are rather moderate or low in magnitude and the effect mechanisms often remain unclear. Effects weaken over time. While success is more common in the areas of health, physical activity, nutrition and stress relief, there was no impact on smoking behavior. A significant evolution can be observed in the quality and quantity of health promotion for the unemployed over time. There is a need for further research on the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions. Intervention strategies should be developed that take account of the diversity of the unemployed and their different needs.

AB  - Beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams, despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas. In this study, we completed a systematic review of previous research on the structure and ecosystem effects of beaver canals to provide an increasingly holistic understanding of these landscape features. Specifically, we: 1) summarized why, where, when, and how beaver develop canals; 2) chronicled all published descriptions on beaver canal morphology; and 3) summarized the literature on the environmental effects of beaver canals. Thirty-one relevant studies were identified and incorporated into this review. Beaver canals have been identified in numerous environments ranging from largely undeveloped mountainous regions to heavily developed agricultural landscapes. Beaver primarily develop canals to increase accessibility to riparian resources, facilitate transport of harvested resources, and to decrease predation risk. As with beaver dams, beaver canals exhibit large structural variability, particularly in lengths, which can be over 0.5 km. Widths of about 1 m and depths of about 0.5 m are common. Beaver canals alter watershed hydrology by creating new aquatic habitats, connecting isolated aquatic features, and diverting water into colonized areas. Beaver canals have been identified as favored habitats for several biotic species and are sometimes used during critical life stages (e.g. dispersal). In addition to increasing overall floral and faunal species richness and diversity, beaver canals may benefit biota by mitigating habitat fragmentation and climate change impacts. Based on the results of this review, incorporating beaver canals into stream restoration practices may be environmentally beneficial.

T2  - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - GENUINE SAVINGS INDICATORS
AB  - Ireland's first national well-being framework was announced in late 2021. This study offers a systematic review concerning two key missing links whose omission weakens the framework's coherence. The first is the lack of clarity surrounding the concept of sustainable development leading to potential confusion between the trade-offs surrounding well-being today and sustained well-being into the future. The second is a lack of regional integration that threatens to distort policy choices regarding regional development. Considerations for the future development of the national well-being framework are presented through an amended dashboard, a suite of suggested indicators at a more disaggregated regional level that intersects relevant well-being themes and a practical policy application of an amended framework to the monitoring of the goals of the National Planning Framework.

AB  - Simulating cropland soil carbon changes following a reduction in tillage intensity is necessary to determine the utility of this management practice in climate change mitigation. In instances where reduced or no tillage increases soil carbon stocks, this is typically due to reduced decomposition rates of plant residues. Although some soil carbon models contain a priori decomposition rate modifiers to account for tillage regime, these are typically not calibrated to specific climatic regions, and none are currently available for the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC). Here, we present a modelling framework to estimate a tillage rate modifier (TRM) for the decomposition rate constants in RothC-26.3 which determine decay between soil carbon pools. We demonstrate this for northwest Europe, using published data assembled through a recent systematic review with propagation of error from input parameters throughout the framework. The small magnitude of soil carbon change following a reduction in tillage intensity in this region is reflected in our TRM estimates for no-till of 0.95, with 95% Credible Intervals [0.91, 1.00], and reduced tillage of 0.93 [0.90, 0.97], relative to conventional high-intensity tillage with a default TRM of 1. These TRMs facilitate realistic simulation of soil carbon dynamics following a reduction of tillage intensity using RothC, and our simple, transparent, and repeatable modelling framework is suitable for application in other climatic regions using input data generalisable to the context of interest.

AB  - To mitigate conflicting land use demands and to reduce increasing land consumption, effective instruments for steering land use are needed. While conventional instruments for land use planning have been increasingly criticised, economic instruments (such as taxes, subsidies and tradeable permits) have received growing attention in practice and research. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic overview of current research on the application of economic instruments in the context of land use. We thereby identified focus areas in the research field, highlighted research needs and provide an overview of the effectiveness of different economic instruments in the context of land use. Overall, we confirmed that economic instruments have substantial potential in the context of land use steering, primarily in regard to taxes, charges and subsidies.

AB  - Purpose: The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem whose composition and function are influenced by many internal and external factors. Overall, the individual GI microbiota composition appears to be rather stable but can be influenced by extreme shifts in environmental exposures. To date, there is no systematic literature review that examines the effects of extreme environmental conditions, such as strict isolation and confinement, on the GI microbiota.Methods: We conducted a systematic review to examine the effects of isolated and confined environments on the human GI microbiota. The literature search was conducted according to PRISMA criteria using PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Relevant studies were identified based on exposure to isolated and confined environments, generally being also antigen-limited, for a minimum of 28 days and classified according to the microbiota analysis method (cultivation- or molecular based approaches) and the isolation habitat (space, space- or microgravity simulation such as MARS-500 or natural isolation such as Antarctica). Microbial shifts in abundance, alpha diversity and community structure in response to isolation were assessed.Results: Regardless of the study habitat, inconsistent shifts in abundance of 40 different genera, mainly in the phylum Bacillota (formerly Firmicutes) were reported. Overall, the heterogeneity of studies was high. Reducing heterogeneity was neither possible by differentiating the microbiota analysis methods nor by subgrouping according to the isolation habitat. Alpha diversity evolved non-specifically, whereas the microbial community structure remained dissimilar despite partial convergence. The GI ecosystem returned to baseline levels following exposure, showing resilience irrespective of the experiment length.Conclusion: An isolated and confined environment has a considerable impact on the GI microbiota composition in terms of diversity and relative abundances of dominant taxa. However, due to a limited number of studies with rather small sample sizes, it is important to approach an in-depth conclusion with caution, and results should be considered as a preliminary trend. The risk of dysbiosis and associated diseases should be considered when planning future projects in extreme environments.

AB  - Background and objectives: The environmental effects of static gear fishing include habitat-level effects such as permanent changes to the physical environment and the structure of the benthic and epibenthic communities. Ecosystems subjected to prolonged exposure to pressure from static gear may undergo permanent changes and may never regain their prior 'unfished' state even if the fishing pressure is removed entirely. These long-term changes to physical structure of benthic habitats have implications for benthic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Despite this, the understanding of habitat and static fishing gear interactions is limited- with most studies focusing on the impact of mobile fishing gear. The rise of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), where managers and decision-makers manage target species within their environmental context while protecting essential ecosystem services and components, has led to an increased demand for ecosystem-level reference points. A systematic review could provide clarification on the short and long-term impacts of commercial static gear fishing on benthic community diversity.
   Methods: This review will examine primary studies on the relationship between static fishing gear, intensity, and benthic biodiversity to answer the primary question 'How do different types of static fishing gear affect benthic species richness and abundance?'. A structured search will be conducted in English. The search terms used to find relevant data to answer the research question were chosen specifically for this review and were generated using the R package litsearchr. Captured articles will be screened against pre-defined eligibility criteria. The internal and external validity of remaining studies will be classified using a pre-defined framework. Studies meeting validity will be used for data extraction. Data to be extracted includes data on study design, intervention, study results, habitat and geographical context. Outcome data (such as sample sizes, means and measures of variation such as confidence intervals, standard deviations, and standard errors) will also be extracted. Information on effect modifiers will also be collected where available as well as metadata on study methodologies and general article identifiers. Data will be used for both narrative and quantitative synthesis techniques.

AB  - Despite the long-term experience in the application of noise walls, the uncertainty in wall panel service life efficiency is almost equal between panels built from established and new materials, which are-because of the desire to increase the sustainability of noise walls-developing at an ever-faster pace. The presented meta-analysis of data collected during a systematic review of concrete, metal, and wood panels' acoustic and non-acoustic characteristics, long term performance, and cradle-to-gate sustainability aims to reduce this uncertainty and support the process of noise wall design and management by shifting the emphasis in decision making from construction costs to the long-term sustainability of the road traffic noise mitigation project. The multi-criterial analysis showed that when choosing a panel, preference should be given to those using lightweight concrete materials. A further comprehensive cradle-to-grave assessment of lightweight concrete panels with expanded clay and recycled tire rubber aggregates, which was performed to fill a knowledge gap observed in the literature and identify opportunities for the improvement of lightweight concrete sustainability, showed that the main environmental impacts of these panels are due to their production processes and that the way to reduce such impacts is to use panels made with aggregates from secondary raw materials.

AB  - Study region: Irtysh River Basin, a transboundary river laying in the North hemisphere and serving as a home for around 15 million people in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
   Study focus: Considering existing pressures of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources, this research aims to evaluate recent (2010-2022) trends in research about a state-of-the-art of the river in a matter of relationships between hydrological budget, water quality, biodiversity, and policy issues. A literature review was carried out in English, Chinese, and Russian languages for defining key issues in the river management.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Melting of permafrost, glaciers, and snow in the upstream mountains of the River should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget. However, the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset the effect of the increased melting rate along the basin. Efficient operating of existing large dams and reservoirs and the planning of future installations deserves special attention in assurance of the respective water level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin. Implementation of water-saving techniques and restoration of tributaries of Irtysh also play a significant role in keeping the resilience of the river. Handling historical and existing contamination will also guarantee restoration of the river health. The basin management still lacks tripartite agreement, however the principles of hydrosolidarity and no-harm effect are followed by involved countries.

AB  - The evolving field of disruptive technologies has recently gained significant interest in various industries, including agriculture. The fourth industrial revolution has reshaped the context of agricultural technology (AgriTech) with applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and a strong focus on data-driven analytical techniques. Motivated by the advances in AgriTech for agrarian operations, the study presents a state-of-the-art review of the research advances which are, evolving in a fast pace over the last decades (due to the disruptive potential of the technological context). Following a systematic literature approach, we develop a categorisation of the various types of AgriTech, as well as the associated AI-driven techniques which form the continuously shifting definition of AgriTech. The contribution primarily draws on the conceptualisation and awareness about AI-driven AgriTech context relevant to the agricultural operations for smart, efficient, and sustainable farming. The study provides a single normative reference for the definition, context and future directions of the field for further research towards the operational context of AgriTech. Our findings indicate that AgriTech research and the disruptive potential of AI in the agricultural sector are still in infancy in Operations Research. Through the systematic review, we also intend to inform a wide range of agricultural stakeholders (farmers, agripreneurs, scholars and practitioners) and to provide research agenda for a growing field with multiple potentialities for the future of the agricultural operations.

AB  - The UK Government has set an ambitious target of achieving a national "net-zero" greenhouse gas economy by 2050. Agriculture is arguably placed at the heart of achieving net zero, as it plays a unique role as both a producer of GHG emissions and a sector that has the capacity via land use to capture carbon (C) when managed appropriately, thus reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Agriculture's importance, particularly in a UK-specific perspective, which is also applicable to many other temperate climate nations globally, is that the majority of land use nationwide is allocated to farming. Here, we present a systematic review based on peer-reviewed literature and relevant "grey" reports to address the question "how can the agricultural sector in the UK reduce, or offset, its direct agricultural emissions at the farm level?" We considered the implications of mitigation measures in terms of food security and import reliance, energy, environmental degradation, and value for money. We identified 52 relevant studies covering major foods produced and consumed in the UK. Our findings indicate that many mitigation measures can indeed contribute to net zero through GHG emissions reduction, offsetting, and bioenergy production, pending their uptake by farmers. While the environmental impacts of mitigation measures were covered well within the reviewed literature, corresponding implications regarding energy, food security, and farmer attitudes towards adoption received scant attention. We also provide an open-access, informative, and comprehensive dataset for agri-environment stakeholders and policymakers to identify the most promising mitigation measures. This research is of critical value to researchers, land managers, and policymakers as an interim guideline resource while more quantitative evidence becomes available through the ongoing lab-, field-, and farm-scale trials which will improve the reliability of agricultural sustainability modelling in the future.

AB  - Agricultural and forestry advisers and other technical service providers play an important role in supporting farmers and foresters to adapt to climate change. However, not all agricultural and forestry advisers are comfortable talking about climate change with land managers. While there is a demonstrated interest related to climate-related professional development, few examples of curricula developed with the express purpose of serving this audience and a systematic review of these curricula has not been conducted. To address this gap, we reviewed 12 curricula which were developed and implemented between 2001 and 2017. The goal of this review is to apply the lessons learned from a range of climate change-focused curricula to new, regionally or sector-specific educational programs targeting both agricultural advisers and innovative farmers. Our findings suggest that developers of future educational programs consider the following: (a) the specific needs of their audience, including topical interests and learning needs; (b) the use of interdisciplinary teams for curricula development; (c) trade-offs associated with inclusivity and depth of course content; and (d) the advantages of project-based education approaches suited for adult learning audiences. By applying these concepts to future curricula, these curricula are likely to have the greatest level of impact.

AB  - The emergence of politically driven bioeconomy strategies worldwide calls for considering the ecological issues associated with bio-based products. Traditionally, life cycle analysis (LCA) approaches are key tools used to assess impacts through product life cycles, but they present limitations regarding the accounting of multiple ecosystem service-related issues, at both the land-use and supply chain levels. Based on a systematic review of empirical articles, this study provides insights on using LCA assessments to account for ecosystem service-related impacts in the context of bioeconomy activities. We address the following research questions: what is the state of the art of the literature performing LCA assessments of forest-based bioeconomy activities, including the temporal distribution, the geographic areas and products/processes at study, and the approaches and methods used? 2. Which impacts and related midpoints are considered by the reviewed studies and what types of ecosystem service- related information do they bear? Out of over 600 articles found through the Scopus search, 155 were deemed relevant for the review. The literature focuses on North-America and Europe. Most of the articles assessed the environmental impact of lower-value biomass uses. Climate change was assessed in over 90% of the studies, while issues related to ozone, eutrophication, human toxicity, resource depletion, acidification, and environmental toxicity were assessed in 40% to 60% of the studies. While the impact categories accounted for in the reviewed LCA studies bear information relevant to certain provisioning and regulating services, several ecosystem services (especially cultural ones) remain unaccounted for. The implications of our study are relevant for professionals working in the ecosystem services, circular bioeconomy, and/or LCA communities. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural resource management agencies implement conservation policies with the presumption that they are effective and of benefit to aquatic ecosystems. However, it is often difficult to decide what management action to implement and what will be most effective. Here we call for natural resource management agencies to fully adopt and implement evidence-based management (EBM) for conservation and fisheries management. We support this call by providing a primer on systematic reviews, a core tool in evidence synthesis but one that is rarely used in the context of fisheries management. We highlight the benefits and challenges associated with implementing EBM, with a particular focus on the routine decisions and management actions undertaken by natural resource practitioners. We submit that by adopting EBM, practitioners would have access to the best available evidence on the effectiveness of various management and conservation interventions, while providing defensible and credible evidence to inform decision-making processes and policies.

AB  - Purpose - The revitalisation of tangible and intangible urban heritage can foster social cohesion and drive creativity and innovation in a changing global environment. Recognising its potential for economic development, many local municipalities are putting forward efforts to revitalise these areas. However, this has caused these sites to face new pressures, such as gentrification, demographic shifts and commercial exploitation. Therefore, a sustainable redevelopment of urban heritage sites that strikes a balance between the economic, environmental and social dimensions is needed. To plan and manage this balance, a strong and clear indicator to measure the sustainability of urban heritage is required. The study systematically reviewed through Scopus indexed journals the dimensions to develop sustainable indicators of urban heritage sites and highlighted the gaps for future research. It identified the existing studies and explored publications, research methods, challenges and suggestions to develop the indicators.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Statement. The Boolean search was in Scopus indexed journals for papers related to indicators in sustainable urban heritage sites.
   Findings - Most of the literature highlighted the interconnected relationships between the indicators for the sustainability of urban heritage sites: social, economic and environmental dimensions. It further revealed that for a more robust management of sustainable monitoring tools, it is crucial to include governance dimensions. Plus, technology is the intertwined aspect for the four dimensions, with culture identified as the centre for sustainability of urban heritage sites.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper only focused on secondary data using literature review papers that recommend gaps for future research. Possible future research includes alternative, niche literature reviews and the implementation of indicators in regional urban heritage sites.
   Originality/value - It created a new insight into the dimensions recommended to develop sustainable indicators for urban heritage sites.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) are effective mitigations to excessive urban heat. Landscape metrics (LMs) have been widely used to assess how UGS configuration, i.e., edge and area, shape complexity, and aggregation, may facilitate better cooling. However, application of configurational LMs has produced diverging suggestions for planning and design practice, which cannot provide urban and landscape designers with holistic insights for future sustainable development. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to (1) summarize the contextual and methodological factors in pertinent studies, and (2) synthesize extractable results and implications, and see if the contextual and methodological factors may help to interpret the diversity in planning and design implications. A total of 167 studies were identified, covering 90 cities in 27 countries belonging to 16 Ko & BULL;ppen climate zones. Evolving statistical methods have been applied, including spatial, non-spatial, and non-parametric machine-learning analyses. Synthesis of correlation coefficients reveals that patch-level metric SHAPE, and class-level metrics LPI, AI and COHESION yielded generally consistent trends across studies. No consensus was obtained based on patch-level metrics, while class-level analyses suggest aggregated, patchy, larger, and complex-shaped UGS facilitate better cooling. Contextual and methodological factors cannot help interpret the diverging sug-gestions. Few specific planning and design implications on UGS configuration were given. Future studies are suggested to specify either a land-use or land-cover perspective to align with practical scales in planning and design practice, and to formulate specific implications beyond binary suggestions by echoing the heterogeneity of thermal environment and UGS pattern under precise planning and design contexts with practical illustration.

AB  - Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring.

AB  - Nature contributes substantially to human well-being through its diverse material and nonmaterial contributions. However, despite the growing literature on the nonmaterial dimensions of human-nature relations, we lack a systematic understanding of how they are linked with human well-being. Here, we use the concept of cultural ecosystem services (CESs) as a lens to explore this interface. Through a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature, we elicit the unique pathways and mechanisms linking individual CESs and constituents of human well-being, as well as their relative effects. Subsequently, we identify their complex interactions through latent class analysis and multiple correspondence analysis, which delineate five major assemblages that reflect synergies and trade-offs at the interface of CESs and human well-being. We critically discuss key research trends and gaps and propose directions for future research and practice to leverage the potential of the nonmaterial contributions of nature for human well-being and sustainability more broadly.

AB  - In the face of biodiversity loss, it is crucial to broaden the arguments for conservation of protected areas by acknowledging diverse values of nature. We systematically reviewed empirical studies to investigate tourists' values of nature in protected areas over time and across regions. To do so, we explored (1) the main ecological and social characteristics of the case studies; (2) methodological approaches; and (3) value types. Based on the review of 152 articles, we found that economic valuation has received the most scientific attention, while socio-cultural valuation approaches have recently increased. Values were primarily elicited and analyzed quantitatively and in monetary metrics, although valuation methods and frameworks have diversified over the past two decades. However, considering the role of valuation methods and frameworks as value-articulating institutions, we suggest that future research on nature valuation also applies qualitative and non-monetary methods, elicits diverse values, and conducts plural valuation.

AB  - andscape dynamics are a consequence of population growth, which can degrade river ecosystem services. Since various countries approved the millennium ecosystem assessment, it has inspired researchers to examine the relationship between landscape and river ecosystem services. Therefore, this study aims to summarize previous studies about landscape and river ecosystem services using a systematic literature review. This study referred to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta -analysis. Data were obtained from six databases of scientific publications such as Scopus, Pubmed, Directory of Open Access Journals, Scilit, Neliti, and Garba Rujukan Digital. The results show that research on this topic has spread worldwide. Landscape data, reflected in land use and land cover, came from various sources containing geospatial information and is combined with field surveys. There were 3-18 types of land use and land cover and it did not always reflect detailed information about the research area. Meanwhile, nutrient regulation and water quality attracted the most attention for river ecosystem services. The interaction between the two variables is revealed through inferential statistics and modeling. As representations of the natural landscape, forests and grasslands have a positive and significant contribution to river ecosystem services. Therefore, knowledge of landscape and river ecosystem services is a preliminary effort to understand environmental processes in achieving sustainability, also valuable input for conservation and rehabilitation strategies in many countries. This review can be a proper reference for environmental management, especially in the landscape changes related to river ecosystem services.

AB  - Illegal drug production and trafficking has been of very little interest to geographers in spite of the existence of highly geographical issues and of the worldwide distribution of drug plants. Drugs have been largely left out of geography internationally and even more so in France where a geopolitical approach has nevertheless been more successful there than those of cultural geography and geography of development. It is possible that the empirical imperative and the difficulty and risks of conducting field research on an illegal object explain, if not this lack of interest of geographers, at least their neglect of the very topic of illegal drug production. The small place of geographers in academic research on drug production is discussed through a rapid review of the drug-related literature produced by geographers and by researchers from other social sciences.

AB  - Farm level scale policy analysis is receiving increased attention due to a changing agricultural policy orientation. Agent based models (ABM) are farm level models that have appeared in the end of 1990's, having several differences from traditional farm level models, like the consideration of interactions between farms, the way markets are simulated, the inclusion of agents' bounded rationality, behavioral heterogeneity, etc. Considering the potential of ABMs to complement existing farm level models and that they are a relatively recent approach with a growing demand for new models and modelers, we perform a systematic literature review to (a) consolidate in a consistent and transparent way the literature status on policy evaluation ABMs; (b) examine the status of the literature regarding model transparency; the modeling of the agents' decision processes; and the creation of the initial population.

AB  - Conservation involves making decisions on appropriate action from a wide range of options. For conservation to be effective, decision-makers need to know what actions do and do not work. Ideally, decisions should be based on effectiveness as demonstrated by scientific experiment or systematic review of evidence. Can decision-makers get this kind of information? We undertook a formal assessment of the extent to which scientific evidence is being used in conservation practice by conducting a survey of management plans and their compilers from major conservation organizations within the UK. Data collected suggest that the majority of conservation actions remain experience-based and rely heavily on traditional land management practices because, many management interventions remain unevaluated and, although some evidence exists, much is not readily accessible in a suitable form. We argue that nature conservation along with other fields of applied ecology, should exploit the concept of evidence-based practice developed and used in medicine and public health that aims to provide the best available evidence to the decision-maker(s) on the likely outcomes of alternative actions. Through critical evaluation, we present the challenges and benefits of adopting evidence based practice from the decision-makers point of view and identify the process to be followed to make it work.

AB  - Invasive species are considered to be a leading cause of the decline of threatened species. However, this view has been disputed because much of the evidence base is anecdotal. This systematic review, through an extensive, repeatable search using agreed selection criteria, examined the available scientific evidence on invasive species' interactions with the 1363 endangered and threatened species protected under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA). The review found scientific evidence available for 116 endangered or threatened species (8.5% of the ESA list). Of these, 85 species (6.2%) were reported as being negatively impacted by invasive species: 39 located on the continental US and 39 on islands, with seven marine species. The relative percentages of species impacted differed according to location: 4.3% (n = 906) on the continental US, 9.3% (n = 420) on islands. It was found that predation by invasive vertebrates on birds on islands and competition between invasive plants and endangered or threatened plants on the mainland were the main mechanisms of impact. The results of this study contrast markedly with a previous study which found that 49% of imperilled species in the United States were threatened by invasive species. Further research is essential in order to evaluate the impact of invasive species on imperilled species on the ESA list; this would help to reduce the high degree of uncertainty regarding the threat of invasive species due to the lack of empirical information.

AB  - Ecotourism is gaining traction as a veritable approach to biodiversity conservation and livelihood sustenance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The success of this approach rests in part, on the governance architecture of most states in SSA. However, empirical evidence on this subject is fragmented. This shades possibilities to frame conceptual and methodological questions to advance ecotourism governance literature. This study undertakes a review of the literature on ecotourism governance in SSA, using the PROFOR governance assessment framework as analytical lens. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistical methods were employed to analyse 54 published empirical articles on ecotourism governance. The results indicated that studies conducted in Southern Africa (38%) and East Africa (30%) account for close to 70% of the literature on ecotourism governance in SSA. Participation was the most studied ecotourism governance principle (96%), while efficiency was the least (15%). Kruskal-Wallis test statistic showed no significant variation in the study of ecotourism governance principles in the different sub regions of SSA. Methodologically, most of the studies have either employed qualitative (50%) or quantitative (33%) approaches, with few studies employing mixed methods (17%). Future studies need to prioritize mixed-method approaches to study principles such as efficiency and equity in the analysis of ecotourism governance. Equally more empirical research studies should be undertaken in the West and Central Africa sub-regions in order to paint a better picture of the state of ecotourism governance across sub-Saharan Africa in general.

AB  - Photovoltaic poverty alleviation (PVPA), an innovative and unique policy in China aiming at green development and poverty alleviation, has attracted increasing attention from both the public and government. It is therefore useful to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of PVPA and its policy implication. By means of a systematic review, this study constructed the expected causal chain of PVPA based on the Theory of Change (TOC), and verified the extent to which the causality matches the existing 44 literature on China's PVPA from English and Chinese scholarly databases. Results indicate that the identification of PVPA targets is generally accurate, but the annual revenue of 3,000 yuan per household cannot be fully guaranteed. The beneficiaries of PVPA cover individuals/households, villages/communities and counties/areas, and there are positive effects on income, employment, local capability building, industrial development, carbon emissions reduction, environmental and energy consciousness and living environment. However, excessive investment inhibits the promotion efficiency of poverty alleviation, and the causality between PVPA and energy transition needs strong evidence. We emphasize a comprehensive evaluation in the pilot period to avoid widespread disorder among different departments, which claims for high governance capacity and more attention to the households' sense of gain. Policymakers should give full consideration to the participation of poor households to provoke their initiative out of poverty and design systematic policies with diversified livelihood strategies for the poor to fight against the multidimensional poverty. Moreover, the characteristics of the poor and their external living environment need to be taken into account to formulate targeted policies. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Current agricultural practices are increasingly considered to be unsustainable, causing serious threats to the environment. To meet international and European sustainability goals, the transition to sustainable agriculture is pivotal and ways to achieve it are currently under discussion. Conventional agricultural systems are typically highly productive, ensuring high yields for feeding a growing global population, but with significant environmental costs. Contrarily, organic agriculture is perceived as a sustainable farming option, however, is often criticized for achieving lower yields, so that when this factor is taken into account, its advantages are often questioned. To compare the environmental performance of different cropping system, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly applied over time. The present work aims at systematically reviewing LCA studies that consistently assess and compare the environmental impacts of organic and conventional crop systems, enabling the understanding of the environmental performance of organic and conventional management systems, including a broad spectrum of impacts (15 environmental indicators in total). The systematic review, complemented with a meta-analysis, resulted in the selection and analysis of 77 pairwise comparative LCA studies. These perform a comparison between the two cultivation management systems (i.e. organic and conventional) of a specific crop or group of crops, cultivated under similar pedoclimatic conditions in both systems, and show consistency in the main LCA methodological choices. Independently from the functional unit adopted (mass or land-based) and despite the lower yields, organic systems show overall a better environmental performance than conventional ones. These results are valid for the majority of the impacts assessed (climate change, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, use of resources, water, and energy). Certain crop classes systematically show lower impacts when organically cultivated, although exception exists within the same class (e.g. overall trend valid for fruit but not for apples). Fertilisation resulted to be the cultivation process responsible for most of the impacts in conventional systems, playing a key role also in organic systems together with activities linked to machinery and field operations. The heterogeneity of modelling approaches encountered makes the comparison of cropping systems difficult and the definition of trends challenging. Modelling differences were found regarding the choice of functional unit and inventory models to estimate emissions, the inclusion or exclusion of certain processes or flows in the inventory, and the selection and modelling of impact categories. In addition, key aspects such as soil quality, biodiversity and water use are still poorly investigated.

AB  - The growing urban complexity calls for evidence-based decision-making to guarantee efficient policies and outcomes. This is only possible by bridging the gap between academia and public sector through comprehensive methods and synthesis capacity. Dendrochronology, or the study of tree rings, is renowned for its support of public policies, but its applications in cities have lagged behind. To bridge this knowledge gap and prove urban dendrochronology as a valuable toolkit for evidence-based decision-making, we systematically reviewed 181 studies on urban and peri-urban forests. The wide geographical distribution of the studies points to the value of urban dendrochronology under various climate and demographic conditions, as does the wide array of applications in the assessment of climate risk, cultural heritage, environmental pollution, and tree management. The discussion of these goals is oriented toward decision-makers. We highlighted the gains from urban dendrochronology, its practical applications, and the requirements of timing and resources to produce the evidence needed. We deliberately avoided any reference to underlying biological mechanisms because these should be under the care of their academic partners. We also observed a significant gap in the interpretation of the results of the studies in terms of urban planning, pointing to the need of engaging the authors in supporting the needs of cities. Thus, this systematic review proves dendrochronology as a valuable toolkit for decision-making and it helps to build a bridge between academia and decision-makers for more efficient urban planning.

AB  - Understanding the links between biodiversity, ecosystem services (ES) and human well-being (HWB) is a prerequisite for furthering the agenda of several multilateral environmental agreements and global goals. We performed a systematic review to discuss the extent to which biodiversity research has addressed the interface between ES and HWB and we focused on Brazil as a case study of global relevance. We found that biodiversity research in Brazil remains focused predominantly on biological processes and that research on the links with ES and HWB is in its early phases, exhibiting scarce connections with provisioning and cultural services. This pattern reveals the nature of existing funding policies and scientific gaps in the country. Given the global relevance of Brazil's stock of biodiversity and ES, we argue that research on their links with HWB will be a crucial element of the national and global process of achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

AB  - Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are less likely to be physically active. Walking is important to public health, therefore understanding correlates of walking will inform the development of targeted interventions. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the correlates of walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus were searched up to February 2020 and titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened against eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed. Correlates were synthesized when two or more comparisons were available. 35 studies were selected for synthesis. 21 examined overall walking, 16 examined leisure-time walking and 9 examined walking for transport (8 examined two or more types of walking). Employment status, home ownership, self-rated health, density or number of social ties, perceived neighborhood aesthetics, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with overall walking. Social support for physical activity from friends and family and perceived individual safety were positively associated with leisure-time walking. Objective walkability, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with walking for transport. Most studies were cross-sectional, did not report response rates and used a validated measure of physical activity. Strategies to improve self-rated health, social ties, neighborhood aesthetics, walkability and perceptions of individual safety should be the focus of interventions that aim to improve walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Recommendations for future studies include the need to focus on leisure-time walking and walking for transport; the correlates of walking in males; prospective longitudinal designs; psychological, cognitive and emotional variables; and social, behavioral attributes and skills.

AB  - Purpose Sex work migration involves a huge number of females from Nigeria, and has attracted concerns within and across the country. To add to ongoing conversations about responsible migration, our review underscores the prevalence of sex work migration in Edo State, Nigeria, the drivers and interventions. Design/methodology/approach The review adopted exhaustive search terms coined with the aid of "Boolean Operators". Search terms were entered into several search engines and databases to elicit peer-reviewed and grey literature within sex work migration and human trafficking for commercial sex. An output of 578 studies was recorded with 76 (43 academic papers and 33 grey literature) meeting the inclusion criteria. Findings The study acknowledged wide-spread prevalence of sex work migration involving Nigerian females who are largely from Edo State. It achieved a prioritization of the factors that drive sex work migration based on how frequent they were mentioned in reviewed literature: economic (64.4%), cultural (46%), educational (20%), globalization (14.5%) and political factors (13.2%). Several interventions were highlighted together with their several limitations which include funding, absence of grass-roots engagement, dearth of appropriate professionals, corruption, weak political will, among others. A combination of domestic and international interventions was encouraged, and social workers were found to be needful. Originality/value Our systematic review is the first on this subject, as none was found throughout our search. It seeks to inform policy measures and programmes, as well as horizontal efforts poised to tackle the rising figures of sex work migrants and attendant consequences in Nigeria.

AB  - The tropical South American savannas have been occupied and manipulated by humans since the late Pleistocene. Ecologists consider that soils, hydrology, and seasonal precipitation influence the structure and composition of plants and the fire-proneness of savannas. However, the human influence on these dynamics remains uncertain. This is because little is known about human activities and what influence they have on the diversity of ecosystems. Considering this, our study sought to synthesize the management practices used by small-scale societies of the South American savannas, compile the species that are the focus of direct management, and demonstrate the role of this management in maintaining the diverse ecosystems that make up the savannas. We also set out to test the hypotheses that forms of management differ depending on the ecosystem and cultural matrices. To do so, we conducted a systematic review, in which we collected 51 articles with information about the management carried out by small-scale societies. From this, we categorized 10 management practices directed to ecosystems: protection of the ecosystem, enrichment of species, topographic changes, increased soil fertility, cleaning, prevention of fire, resource promotion, driving of game, swidden-fallow, and maintenance of ecosystem structure. We identified 19 native plant species whose populations are managed in-situ. These management practices have proven capable of keeping savanna and grassland ecosystems open and increasing the occurrence of forest ecosystems in the mosaic, as well as favoring plants of human interest in general. We note that there is a relationship between management practices with ecosystems and cultures, which suggests that both factors influence the management of landscapes. We conclude that management practices of small-scale societies are responsible for domesticating South American tropical savannas and that these savannas are composed of a mosaic of culturally constructed niches. The small-scale societies that inhabit these environments have important traditional ecological knowledge and strategies that enable the use, conservation, and restoration of savannas, extremely threatened by agribusiness today.Systematic Review Registration: [website], identifier [registration number].

AB  - As the development of large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) amplifies due to technological progress and a growing demand for renewable energy, associated footprints on the seabed are becoming increasingly common within soft-bottom environments. A large part of the footprint is the scour protection, often consisting of rocks that are positioned on the seabed to prevent erosion. As such, scour protection may resemble a marine rocky reef and could have important ecosystem functions. While acknowledging that OWFs disrupt the marine environment, the aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of scour protection on fish assemblages, relate them to the effects of designated artificial reefs (ARs) and, ultimately, reveal how future scour protection may be tailored to support abundance and diversity of marine species. The results revealed frequent increases in abundances of species associated with hard substrata after the establishment of artificial structures (i.e., both OWFs and ARs) in the marine environment. Literature indicated that scour protection meets the requirements to function as an AR, often providing shelter, nursery, reproduction, and/or feeding opportunities. Using knowledge from AR models, this review suggests methodology for ecological improvements of future scour protections, aiming towards a more successful integration into the marine environment.

AB  - Certification systems (CS) set and monitor voluntary standards to make agricultural production sustainable in socio-economic terms and agricultural trade fairer for producers and workers. They try to achieve a wide range of socio-economic and environmental effects through bundles of interventions that include the process of standard setting and compliance, advocacy among consumers, capacity building for producers, building supply chains, price interventions, and the application of acceptable labour standards, overall to improve the wellbeing of farmers and agricultural workers.
   This paper presents the results of a mixed-method systematic review that synthesized the literature on socio-economic effects of certification systems on agricultural producers and wage workers in low and middle income countries. The review followed the Campbell Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews, and included studies published between 1990 and 2016 in different languages, with evidence on low and middle income countries. The review included a quantitative effectiveness question focused on a range of intermediate (e.g. prices, wages) and endpoint outcomes (e.g. household income). It also included a question on barriers, facilitators and contextual factors shaping effectiveness which drew on qualitative or mixed-method studies. Eligible certification systems were based on second (industry-level) or third-party certifications, and excluded own-company standards. For the effectiveness review, quantitative impact evaluations must use experimental or non-experimental methods demonstrating control for selection bias. With these inclusion criteria, the review includes 43 studies used for analysing quantitative effects, and 136 qualitative studies for synthesizing barriers, enablers and other contextual factors. Most included studies report on initiatives in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa and focus primarily on agricultural producers. The quality of the included studies is mixed, and several studies are weak on a number of methodological fronts, especially on statistical reporting.
   Overall, there is limited and mixed evidence on the effects of CS on a range of intermediate and final socio-economic outcomes for agricultural producers and wage workers. There are positive effects on prices and income from the sale of produce is higher for certified farmers. However, workers' wages do not seem to benefit from the presence of CS and, further along the causal chain, we find no evidence that total household income improves with certification. The integrated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies shows that context matters substantially in all causal chains and multiple factors shape the effectiveness and causal mechanisms that link interventions associated with certification and the wellbeing of producers, workers and their families.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature on Industry 4.0 - and on the trends and implications of the digitalization of manufacturing - from the perspective of business and economics. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric methodology was used, allowing to extract rigorously the relevant literature, leading to a purposefully constructed database of peer-reviewed publications depicting the state of the art in this area. A quantitative analysis of the key characteristics of - and trends emanating from - the literature was performed, and results were presented in a graphic way using the VOSViewer software as a mapping tool. Relevant thematic clusters were identified, and promising future research avenues were identified. Findings This literature is extremely recent - 90% of the publications are from 2019 and 2020, and the leading journal publishing in this area is the Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management. Key clusters identified relate digital transformation to value chains; a close link is observed between Industry 4.0 technologies and business models; a strong connection to sustainability is also clear; and the implications of Industry 4.0 for human resources management are, not surprisingly, extremely relevant. Originality/value This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the most comprehensive systematic review linking specifically Industry 4.0 to the business and economics literature, bridging with recent, state-of-the-art research in the economics/business and technological fields. This contribution may be very helpful to researchers interested in understanding the key trends and opportunities offered by this area.

AB  - The treatment landscape for gastric cancer (GC) is constantly evolving with therapies affecting all aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which need careful monitoring. While there are HRQoL measures designed specifically to capture issues relevant to patients with GC, these might be outdated and only relevant to patients in westernised cultures. This review identifies the patient-reported measures used to assess HRQoL of patients with GC and compares the HRQoL measures used across cultures including East Asia, where GC is more prevalent. We conducted a systematic review of publications between January 2001 and January 2021. A total of 267 papers were identified; the majority (66%) of studies involved patients from East Asian countries. Out of the 24 HRQoL questionnaires captured, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Cancer measure (QLQ-C30) was the most widely used (60% of all studies and 62% of those involving patients from East Asian countries), followed by its gastric cancer-specific module (QLQ-STO22, 34% of all studies and 41% from East Asia). Eight questionnaires were developed within East Asian countries and, of the 20 studies including bespoke questions, 16 were from East Asia. There were six qualitative studies. HRQoL issues captured include diarrhoea, constipation, reflux, abdominal pain and abdominal fulness or bloating, difficulty swallowing, restricted eating, and weight loss. Psychosocial issues related to these problems were also assessed. Issues relating to the compatibility of some of the westernised measures within East Asian cultures were highlighted.

AB  - There is a growing demand for advancing products and renewable technologies worldwide that rely on rare earth elements (REEs), including those directly necessary for a low-carbon energy transition, national security appli-cations, and consumer electronics. This study focuses on current nature-based biological methods (i.e., bio-leaching and biosorption) for REEs extraction from electronic wastes (e-wastes) and ore deposits. Comprehensive narrative and systematic reviews of bioleaching and biosorption extraction methods are performed to identify their sustainability challenges and benefits, and highlight the potential pathways that would address the existing gaps. From the narrative review, it is evident that biological methods for REEs extraction are more environ-mentally friendly than conventional methods currently used in the REE mining industry (e.g., acid leaching and solvent extraction). From the systematic review, it is clear that bioleaching and biosorption research has been a rapidly growing field of interest over the last 10 years, particularly for precious metals extraction (e.g., copper and gold). From both reviews, it is apparent that REEs extraction from domestic ore deposits alone is inadequate, and sustainable REEs recovery from e-wastes is also necessary to meet the growing REEs demand. It is concluded that targeted mixed REEs extraction for specific products can be a potential pathway for sustainable REEs extraction from both ore and e-wastes that would reduce separation costs and emissions from the associated use of harsh chemicals. It is further concluded that nature-based biological REE extraction solutions offer an op-portunity to generate significant socio-economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Clinical guidelines for managing patients with AF do not include a referral to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) at present, although it is routine for most other cardiovascular conditions. The number of studies evaluating the impact of CR on the health of patients with AF is growing, but there has been no consolidation of the findings. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of CR programs on physical and mental health outcomes in patients with all forms of AF.
   Methods: Six electronic databases were searched to identify all studies that reported on the impact of CR in patients with AF. Searching identified 5771 potential articles, of which 12 were included. The physical health outcomes evaluated included cardiometabolic health indicators, aerobic and functional capacity, severity of symptoms, recurrence of AF, hospitalizations, and mortality. The mental health outcomes assessed included quality of life, anxiety, depression, and quality of sleep.
   Results: The limited evidence supports the use of CR to improve cardiometabolic health indicators and aerobic and functional capacity in patients with AF. The current evidence suggests that prominent improvements in aerobic fitness are associated with lower risk of hospitalization and mortality. The conflicting mental health findings may be due to the varying severity of AF and or modes of exercise interventions.
   Conclusions: Gaps in the research identified the need for greater rigor in the reporting of intervention details, outcomes, and statistical methodology; sex-and gender-based analyses; and effectiveness trials. This review serves as a call to action for more work globally on this important area.

AB  - REDD+ is a payments mechanism through environmental services that proposes the reduction of greenhouse gas emission caused by change in use of tropical forest lands. The present study aimed to identify the REDD+ dimensions in tropical forests in the world, approaching a broader discussion about themes by focusing on Brazil and Indonesia. A systematic review of scientific literature relating to Brazil and Indonesia was used as an analysis method. A total of 102 scientific articles with themes related to REDD+ development were selected. Through analysis of the selected articles, REDD+ dimensions with frequent mentions in the scientific literature were identified, such as governance, implementation, beneficiaries, land use, monitoring, biodiversity, financing, forest management, deforestation, conservation, safeguard, and opportunity cost. The analysis identified the existence of political barriers the implementation of REDD+ and recommends dialogue in order to maintain the balance of beneficiaries and the environment. Both beneficiary countries and payers should invest in longer-term and more efficient REDD+ practices, such as long-term programs and more defined criteria for project evaluation.

AB  - Plants are essential for our lives because they provide food, medicine, fuel, shelter, and immaterial resources. Understanding patterns of plant uses through large-scale plant use analysis may contribute to the development of a biocultural conservation approach. We conducted a systematic review to assess current knowledge of the ethnoflora of Argentina, as well as to identify taxonomic and geographic patterns of ethnobotanical uses of native plants at the large scale. We analyzed 124 articles reporting the use of 1706 species. We found that the most widely studied region and use category were Chaco and medicine, respectively. The number of useful native species within a family was positively related to the total native species in each family at the country level. In general, species of greatest cultural importance at the country level had a wide distribution. Almost 70% of native plants used in one phytogeographic province were exclusive to it, and species with the highest importance were characteristic elements of its vegetation. We found that southern Argentina has an exclusive ethnoflora that differs from that in a large area of central and northern Argentina. Our review highlights that plants used by people are intimately associated with the local environment, and that species with great cultural importance across phytogeographic provinces are frequent in the landscape. We provide the first analysis of ethnobotanical studies and a database of useful native plants across Argentina. This information highlights strengths and gaps in knowledge of useful native species, which is crucial for conservation, sustainability and human well-being.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol ogica e Conservacao.

AB  - Avian studies have explored how development and landscape fragmentation leads to a loss of native avifauna, particularly migrants during the breeding season. However, during the winter and migration seasons, cities and surrounding fragmented areas could provide habitat for a variety of migrating birds. Unfortunately, much of the information on the occurrence of migrant species in cities has been concentrated in United States/Canada and little is known about the role of Neotropical cities. We performed a systematic review of the occurrence of forest Neotropical Migrant Bird Species (NMB) in small forest fragments and residential areas with urban tree canopy in Latin American countries during fall/spring migration and winter. We identified a total of 58 forest NMB from 19 studies, including 45 Nearctic Migrants and 12 Austral Migrants, and 54 NMB were found in small urban/rural fragments (0.5-19.6 ha) and 30 were found in residential areas. In addition, six NMB considered as interior-forest specialists during the breeding season in United States/Canada were found using small forest fragments or residential areas during fall/spring migration and winter. This suggests that for some interior-forest specialists, breeding in large forested areas does not preclude their use of fragmented areas as stopover and wintering sites. Urban and rural forest fragments and residential areas could serve as habitat for NMB in and around Neotropical cities, but more research is needed to determine whether fragmented habitats are used by a variety of NMB during migration and winter seasons.

AB  - Aim Understanding broad-scale ecological patterns and processes is necessary if we are to mitigate the consequences of anthropogenically driven biodiversity degradation. However, such analyses require large datasets and current data collation methods can be slow, involving extensive human input. Given rapid and ever-increasing rates of scientific publication, manually identifying data sources among hundreds of thousands of articles is a significant challenge, which can create a bottleneck in the generation of ecological databases.
   Innovation Here, we demonstrate the use of general, text-classification approaches to identify relevant biodiversity articles. We apply this to two freely available example databases, the Living Planet Database and the database of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems) project, both of which underpin important biodiversity indicators. We assess machine-learning classifiers based on logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks, and identify aspects of the text-processing workflow that influence classification performance.
   Main conclusions Our best classifiers can distinguish relevant from non-relevant articles with over 90% accuracy. Using readily available abstracts and titles or abstracts alone produces significantly better results than using titles alone. LR and neural network models performed similarly. Crucially, we show that deploying such models on real-world search results can significantly increase the rate at which potentially relevant papers are recovered compared to a current manual protocol. Furthermore, our results indicate that, given a modest initial sample of 100 relevant papers, high-performing classifiers could be generated quickly through iteratively updating the training texts based on targeted literature searches. These findings clearly demonstrate the usefulness of text-mining methods for constructing and enhancing ecological datasets, and wider application of these techniques has the potential to benefit large-scale analyses more broadly. We provide source code and examples that can be used to create new classifiers for other datasets.

AB  - This article aims to find out how the terms tourism and culture have been treated throughout history and when they began to be of interest to the scientific community as a result of the change in the conceptual mentality of the tourism sector in general and the tourist in particular, as well as to understand the evolutionary stage reached. To this end, bibliometric analysis has been carried out, based on a quantitative and systematic review of the literatura, using the Web of Science (WoSCC) database. The software used is Vosviewer and Bibliometrix to generate graphs and maps of relationships and clusters... We can highlight the degree of connection that exists between all the articles published in the period studied (1995 to 2020) due to the number of citations made. This work aims to identify the main trends in research on cultural tourism.

AB  - The dugong (Dugong dugon; Muller, 1776) is a vulnerable marine mammal species. This systematic review aims to provide information about the remaining populations, distributions, and habitat sites of the dugong in Southeast Asia. By combining this information with scientific research, critical knowledge gaps about dugongs in this region can be filled. This review showed that dugong populations have not only been reduced but also scattered in coastal waters. Little information is available about the remaining population numbers and distributions of dugongs. The largest estimated populations were reported around East Malaysia (688 to 1,376 dugongs); North Sulawesi, Indonesia (1,000 dugongs); and in the Andaman Sea, Thailand (200 to 250 dugongs). Published research has been very limited-approximately two articles per year. From 1993 until 2021, articles about the dugong were published in the context of ecology, conservation, biology, socioecology, biochemistry, and physiology. Visual and aerial surveying and anecdotal information about sightings and strandings of dugongs were the typical methods of research in Southeast Asia The conservation strategy in this region is still focused on specific subject areas. The knowledge base for the species is lacking detailed quantitative data on remaining dugong populations, movements, habitats, and mating periods. Behavioral information lacks data for both spatial and temporal variations in foraging behavior, for example. Elucidation is needed in several different aspects of seagrass ecosystem dynamics. Improvements in captive dugong husbandry are also needed to ensure the sustainable conservation of the dugong in the region. National and international management decisions must be based on solid scientific data and multisector integration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses experience many job tensions, which lead to job burnout. The consequences of nurses' job burnout include absenteeism, reduced quality of patient care, interpersonal conflicts with colleagues, physical and mental problems, reluctance to provide care with patients, and quitting the job.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of job burnout among nurses in Iran using a meta-analysis method.
   METHOD: The study was conducted through a meta-analysis method based on the PRISMA checklist. An unlimited search was conducted until 2020 to access the Persian and English papers in national databases, including Medlib, SID, Iranmedex, and Magiran, and databases including Cochrane, Science-Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The keywords were "job burnout, nurse, and Iran." The data were searched and extracted by two researchers independently. All analyses were performed using version 2.0 of the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of job burnout was investigated in 14 papers with a sample size of 2271 individuals with an average age of 31.44 years old, and a confidence interval of 55% (44-66%). Fars province, with 89.2%, had the highest, and Zanjan province, with 25.9%, experienced the lowest prevalence of job burnout. The overall prevalence of job burnout was 44% in males and 66% in females so that the highest prevalence was in women.
   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of job burnout in nurses was high in some areas of Iran. A special attention by managers is needed in this field because of the several roles played by the nurses in the healthcare system and the improvement of public health. Implementation of plans to reduce the job burnout and to improve the mental health of nurses by reducing work hours, giving more opportunities to them to express their opinion(s) in amount of salary and benefits, and creating better working conditions are recommended.

AB  - Agroforestry has been proposed as a sustainable agricultural system over conventional agriculture and forestry, conserving biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem service provision while not compromising productivity. However, the available evidence for the societal benefits of agroforestry is fragmented and does often not integrate diverse ecosystem services into the assessment. To upscale existing case-study insights to the European level, we conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of agroforestry on ecosystem service provision and on biodiversity levels. From 53 publications we extracted a total of 365 comparisons that were selected for the meta-analysis. Results revealed an overall positive effect of agroforestry (effect size = 0.454, p < 0.01) over conventional agriculture and forestry. However, results were heterogeneous, with differences among the types of agroforestry practices and ecosystem services assessed. Erosion control, biodiversity, and soil fertility are enhanced by agroforestry while there is no clear effect on provisioning services. The effect of agroforestry on biomass production is negative. Comparisons between agroforestry types and reference land-uses showed that both silvopastoral and silvoarable systems increase ecosystem service provision and biodiversity, especially when compared with forestry land. Mediterranean tree plantation systems should be especially targeted as soil erosion could be highly reduced while soil fertility increased. We conclude that agroforestry can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem service provision relative to conventional agriculture and forestry in Europe and could be a strategically beneficial land use in rural planning if its inherent complexity is considered in policy measures.

AB  - The global use of off-road vehicles (ORVs) in natural environments has accelerated rapidly over the last few decades, resulting in significant social and environmental consequences. As the demand, use, and promotion of light-duty ORVs like all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, four-wheel drive trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) increases in remote wilderness, the landscape is becoming fragmented into disorganized and destructive networks of trails and roads. Substantial ecological impacts to a wide range of ecosystem structures and functions will likely result from ORV activity. Applying a global systematic review, we examine 105 publications about plant, soil, and wildlife responses to ORV traffic in different habitats to help guide the direction of future research, monitoring programs, and mitigation efforts. Most studies investigated impacts to animals, followed by soils, then vegetative responses. Soil studies primarily focused on physical impacts to the soil (i.e., compaction, erosion, rut depth), but some studies suggest that soil chemical and biological properties may also be impacted by ORV traffic. The literature on plant responses to ORV activities primarily explored vegetation loss, although impacts on the plant community were also investigated. Animal studies investigated impacts of ORV use on invertebrates, mammals, birds, and to a lesser extent reptiles/amphibians, including population-level, community-level, and behavioral responses. Overall, research on environmental impacts of ORV traffic is biased to coastal and desert ecosystems in the northern hemisphere (primarily in the US), often does not address mechanisms that may produce ecological impacts (e.g., intensity of vehicular disturbance and ecosystem- or species-specific sensitivity to ORV activities), and frequently focused on short-term responses. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms that cause the different responses of soil, plant, and animals to ORVs over the long-term in a broad range of ecosystems to support real-time management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Promoting natural regeneration can be a viable strategy to achieve ambitious restoration commitments, but predicting where native forest cover is likely to expand is challenging. Different biophysical and socioeconomic factors may determine the chances of native forest regrowth at different spatial and temporal scales, producing complex spatial patterns in the landscape and adding more and deeper information about potential for different forms of forest restoration. On the basis of a systematic literature review including 64 peer-reviewed articles from the global tropics and subtropics published from 1990 to 2017, we assessed the methodologies employed to remotely detect forest cover increase and to identify its biophysical and socioeconomic drivers. Automatic classification of multitemporal images and transition matrices were the most popular methods to detect areas of forest regrowth, whereas regression analysis was the most used analytical approaches to assess drivers. Forest cover increased more often on steeper slopes, close to forest remnants, inside protected areas, and far from population centers. However, the effects of most drivers varied among scales of evaluation and may be further affected by the scale of forest regrowth. The most influential biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest cover increase identified here can be used to develop predictive models on the likelihood of native forest regrowth to guide the implementation of cost-effective tropical forest restoration, thus contributing to the mitigation of climate change and species extinction. Current remote-sensing literature evaluating forest cover changes seems to be largely focused on deforestation dynamics, with little attention given to forest cover increase.

AB  - Background: In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition?
   Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
   Review findings: During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests.
   Conclusions: The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies. Therefore, generalization of the results must be done carefully.

AB  - Academia has a crucial role to play in informing urgently needed actions on climate mitigation. It is vital to understand what is known about the potential contribution of climate mitigation options, the barriers that exist to achieving that contribution, and to quantify the research balance and geographic focus of these various approaches across the literature. This PRISMA-based systematic literature review aims to provide the reader with the following: Firstly, an overview of the post-Paris climate mitigation research landscape and secondly, an assessment of the climate mitigation potential of those options per the literature reviewed. Analysis of the research landscape demonstrated that supply-side research greatly outnumbers that on the demand-side, which totalled just half of that which focused on the supply-side. In terms of the geographic scale, the reviewed literature was dominated by national-level studies, with sub-national studies the least common, particularly those at a local government level. Given this, it can be concluded that two key areas would benefit from further research-that focusing on demand-side mitigation, and that carrying research out at more local levels. On climate mitigation potential, wind and solar energy were found to be the biggest contributors to a decarbonised energy supply, across a range of study areas. Discrepancies were identified between findings in the academic and grey literature for several options, chiefly bioenergy and nuclear power: bioenergy made significantly higher contributions in the academic literature versus grey literature, with the opposite true for nuclear. Demand-side options all demonstrated significant mitigation potential in the literature reviewed but received very limited coverage in comparison to many of their supply-side counterparts. Future research should pursue this knowledge gap to reach a better understanding of the contributions they can make and ensure that policymakers have the data necessary to chart a course to a zero-carbon future.

AB  - Seagrass meadows, algal forests and mussel beds are widely regarded as foundation species that support communities providing valuable ecosystem services in many coastal regions; however, quantitative evidence of the relationship is scarce. Using the Baltic Sea as a case study, a region of significant socio-economic importance in the northern hemisphere, we systematically synthesized the primary literature and summarized the current knowledge on ecosystem services derived from seagrass, macroalgae, and mussels (see animated video summary of the manuscript: Video abstract). We found 1740 individual ecosystem service records (ESR), 61% of which were related to macroalgae, 26% to mussel beds and 13% to seagrass meadows. The most frequently reported ecosystem services were raw material (533 ESR), habitat provision (262 ESR) and regulation of pollutants (215 ESR). Toxins (356 ESR) and nutrients (302 ESR) were the most well-documented pressures to services provided by coastal ecosystems. Next, we assessed the current state of knowledge as well as knowledge transfer of ecosystem services to policies through natural, social, human and economic dimensions, using a systematic scoring tool, the Eco-GAME matrix. We found good quantitative information about how ecosystems generated the service but almost no knowledge of how they translate into socio-economic benefits (8 out of 657 papers, 1.2%). While we are aware that research on Baltic Sea socio-economic benefits does exist, the link with ecosystems providing the service is mostly missing. To close this knowledge gap, we need a better analytical framework that is capable of directly linking existing quantitative information about ecosystem service generation with human benefit.

AB  - Urban expansion has ushered in a landscape of opportunities and challenges across housing, transportation, education, health, and the economy. In response to these evolving dynamics, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) technologies has emerged as a transformative solution. While smart traffic monitoring and advanced parking distribution systems have eased urban pressures, optimizing mobility remains pivotal in the context of burgeoning smart cities. However, the seaport industry grapples with formidable issues in the efficient transport of containers. In light of this, the fusion of AI and CV technology holds promise as a solution. This study pioneers a systematic review, representing a novel exploration, delving into a comprehensive evaluation of the existing literature. It scrutinizes the profound advantages AI and CV offer in constructing sustainable, efficient parking ecosystems within seaports. Our methodological approach encompasses data collection, rigorous quality assessment, and meticulous exploration of the application of CV and AI in the realm of smart parking management. The findings underscore the pivotal role of AI and CV technologies in the development of efficient, sustainable transportation systems, particularly for optimizing container movement within seaports. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the literature in the area of the application of AI and CV technologies in optimizing parking management at seaports, shedding light on the potential for sustainable transportation solutions in this critical domain. As these technologies usher in enhancements in traffic management, parking space allocation, and container logistics within seaports, this study represents a vital and timely contribution to the field, serving as a cornerstone for future innovations in seaport management and the broader context of smart cities.

AB  - Dietary patterns spanning millennia could inform contemporary public health nutrition. Children are largely absent from evidence describing diets throughout human evolution, despite prevalent malnutrition today signaling a potential genome-environment divergence. This systematic review aimed to identify dietary patterns of children ages 6 months to 10 years consumed before the widespread adoption of agriculture. Metrics of mention frequency (counts of food types reported) and food groups (globally standardized categories) were applied to: compare diets across subsistence modes [gatherer-hunter-fisher (GHF), early agriculture (EA) groups]; examine diet quality and diversity; and characterize differences by life course phase and environmental context defined using Koppen-Geiger climate zones. The review yielded child diet information from 95 cultural groups (52 from GHF; 43 from EA/mixed subsistence groups). Animal foods (terrestrial and aquatic) were the most frequently mentioned food groups in dietary patterns across subsistence modes, though at higher frequencies in GHF than in EA. A broad range of fruits, vegetables, roots and tubers were more common in GHF, while children from EA groups consumed more cereals than GHF, associated with poor health consequences as reported in some studies. Forty-eight studies compared diets across life course phases: 28 showed differences and 20 demonstrated similarities in child versus adult diets. Climate zone was a driver of food patterns provisioned from local ecosystems. Evidence from Homo sapiens evolution points to the need for nutrient-dense foods with high quality proteins and greater variety within and across food groups. Public health solutions could integrate these findings into food-based dietary guidelines for children.
   Lay Summary Drawing insights from child dietary patterns of our evolutionary past might better inform public health nutrition today. This systematic review revealed higher intakes of animal source foods (ASF), fruits, roots/tubers, nuts and overall dietary diversity among gather-hunter-fisher compared to early agriculture groups. To prevent child malnutrition, dietary guidelines might incorporate these findings.

AB  - In April 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) released its recovery plan for the jaguar Panthera onca after several decades of discussion, litigation and controversy about the status of the species in the USA. The USFWS estimated that potential habitat, south of the Interstate-10 highway in Arizona and New Mexico, had a carrying capacity of c. six jaguars, and so focused its recovery programme on areas south of the USA-Mexico border. Here we present a systematic review of the modelling and assessment efforts over the last 25 years, with a focus on areas north of Interstate-10 in Arizona and New Mexico, outside the recovery unit considered by the USFWS. Despite differences in data inputs, methods, and analytical extent, the nine previous studies found support for potential suitable jaguar habitat in the central mountain ranges of Arizona and New Mexico. Applying slightly modified versions of the USFWS model and recalculating an Arizona-focused model over both states provided additional confirmation. Extending the area of consideration also substantially raised the carrying capacity of habitats in Arizona and New Mexico, from six to 90 or 151 adult jaguars, using the modified USFWS models. This review demonstrates the crucial ways in which choosing the extent of analysis influences the conclusions of a conservation plan. More importantly, it opens a new opportunity for jaguar conservation in North America that could help address threats from habitat losses, climate change and border infrastructure.

AB  - As a form of green infrastructure, green roofs can enhance urban biodiversity by providing complex vegetation structures, supplying increased foraging and roosting opportunities for animals and increasing habitat connectivity. Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces.

AB  - To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating "activity-friendly environments."Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activity-friendly environments. An extensive but non- systematic review of scientific and "gray" literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed "strong" evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps.

AB  - Environmental merits are a common motivation for many urban agriculture (UA) projects. One powerful way of quantifying environmental impacts is with life cycle assessment (LCA): a method that estimates the environmental impacts of producing, using, and disposing of a good. LCAs of UA have proliferated in recent years, evaluating a diverse range of UA systems and generating mixed conclusions about their environmental performance. To clarify the varied literature, we performed a systematic review of LCAs of UA to answer the following questions: What is the scope of available LCAs of UA (geographic, crop choice, system type)? What is the environmental performance and resource intensity of diverse forms of UA? How have these LCAs been done, and does the quality and consistency allow the evidence to support decision making? We searched for original, peer-reviewed LCAs of agricultural production at UA systems, and selected and evaluated 47 papers fitting our analysis criteria, covering 88 different farms and 259 production systems. Focusing on yield, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and cumulative energy demand, using functional units based on mass of crops grown and land occupied, we found a wide range of results. We summarized baseline ranges, identified trends across UA profiles, and highlighted the most impactful parts of different systems. There were examples of all types of systems-across physical set up, crop type, and socio-economic orientation-achieving low and high impacts and yields, and performing better or worse than conventional agriculture. However, issues with the quality and consistency of the LCAs, the use of conventional agriculture data in UA settings, and the high variability in their results prevented us from drawing definitive conclusions about the environmental impacts and resource use of UA. We provided guidelines for improving LCAs of UA, and make a strong case that more research on this topic is necessary to improve our understanding of the environmental impacts and benefits of UA.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on smart governance, defined as technology-enabled collaboration between citizens and local governments to advance sustainable development. The lack of empirical evidence on the positive outcomes of smart cities/smart governance motivated us to conduct this study. Our findings show that empirical evidence for the alleged sustainability benefits is sparse. In addition, the emerging picture is ambiguous in that it reports both positive and negative effects in respect to the sustainability achievements of smart governance. The study identifies contextual conditions of smart governance as crucial to understanding these mixed outcomes. Our paper points up the need for more empirical work and develops an agenda for researching the relationship between smart governance and sustainability outcomes.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are widely used to allow for safe animal movement across roads, promoting both human safety and wildlife conservation. These structures are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore cost-effective design is essential. Although there has been much research to date on the factors affecting the usage of WCS by wildlife, no attempt has been made to synthesize these results and assess the current state of knowledge. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific and profes-sional literature to assess the state of empirical evidence on WCS and a meta-analysis to explore the factors that influence their effectiveness. We identified a total of 270 studies that reported empirical results span-ning four decades of research. Most studies (161) measured the number of crossing events without moni-toring approaches to the structure, thus limiting the ability to assess WCS effectiveness. Only 77 studies measured the proportion of successful crossings to approaches, which was the type of data used for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results show that viaducts are the most effective type of WCS for large mammals. For example, the odds of ungulates crossing through a viaduct are 2.9 times that of an overpass, and 3.6 times that of an under-pass. WCS built specifically for wildlife are used significantly more than those built for dual use by humans and wildlife. For large carnivores, the odds of using a dedicated WCS are 15.9 times that of a structure used concur-rently by humans. We additionally found that natural materials and round shapes are preferable in the design of effective WCS. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of adopting large-scale monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. More broadly, we conclude that further research focusing on under-studied species and structure characteristics is needed to facilitate cost-effective mitigation efforts that reduce wildlife-vehicle colli-sions and promote wildlife conservation.

AB  - There is a growing effort to use access to remote sensing data (RS) in conjunction with crop model simulation capability to improve the accuracy of crop growth and yield estimates. This is critical for sustainable agricultural management and food security, especially in farming communities with limited resources and data. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of research on data assimilation and summarize how its application varies by country, crop, and farming systems. In addition, we highlight the implications of using process-based crop models (PBCMs) and data assimilation in small-scale farming systems. Using a strict search term, we searched the Scopus and Web of Science databases and found 497 potential publications. After screening for relevance using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 123 publications were included in the final review. Our results show increasing global interest in RS data assimilation approaches; however, 81% of the studies were from countries with relatively high levels of agricultural production, technology, and innovation. There is increasing development of crop models, availability of RS data sources, and characterization of crop parameters assimilated into PBCMs. Most studies used recalibration or updating methods to mainly incorporate remotely sensed leaf area index from MODIS or Landsat into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model to improve yield estimates for staple crops in large-scale and irrigated farming systems. However, these methods cannot compensate for the uncertainties in RS data and crop models. We concluded that further research on data assimilation using newly available high-resolution RS datasets, such as Sentinel-2, should be conducted to significantly improve simulations of rare crops and small-scale rainfed farming systems. This is critical for informing local crop management decisions to improve policy and food security assessments.

AB  - The Himalayan region is not only threatened by rapid changes in anthropogenic activities but also by global climate change. Given the uncertainties of magnitude and characteristics of climate change, prior knowledge of long-term changing distribution pattern of forests is of crucial importance. Owing to the heterogeneity of the Himalayan mountain system, knowledge on potential impacts on forests makes it a paramount concern in this region. Therefore, to understand vulnerability as a prerequisite for forest management, we systematically review and synthesize peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts of the Himalayan forests (n = 118). Of the reviewed articles, 91.5% were published after 2009. Our findings emphasize that due to a wide variety of disciplinary domains, the conceptual, methodological, and subsequent findings (observed and predicted) vary greatly given the complexity of the theme of the review. Most assessments addressing climate change vulnerability of forests and forest-dependent people fail to acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability. In addition, despite the brevity of the phenomena, much lesser is known about adaptation potentials, planning and policy initiatives, and coordinated multi-disciplinary decision making for managing forest resources and dependent livelihood options under different climate change scenarios. This insufficiency of knowledge requires identification of more prioritized focused research efforts. Given the substantial debate surrounding research management and policy-making, we highlight the urgent need to deal with ecological and societal implications of climate change impacts on the Himalayan forests.

A systematic review of the literature available from 2005 to 2019 was performed to assess the current state of knowledge on this topic. The number of scientific papers on interactions among multiple ecosystem services (trade-offs, synergies, bundles/clusters, and flows) has increased exponentially since 2005. The review shows that researchers usually only consider a limited number of ecosystem services, which restricts the ability to explore their interactions with one another. In general, logical and empirical models are used most often, followed by extrapolations, simulation processes, data integration methods, and direct-mapping models. Although our review shows an increase in the use of two or more modeling techniques in a complementary way (77% of the studies), this practice needs to be more broadly adopted. And though the diversity of modeling tools applied to the study of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services (26 tools in 209 studies) was high, InVEST was still the most applied tool despite its limitations for integrating multiple ecosystem services. Based on these findings, we discuss possible ways for improving our understanding of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services and examine the main barriers and limitations mentioned in the studies reviewed.

AB  - As the world faces the detrimental effects of humanity on the environment, the circular economy has started receiving a lot of attention as a tool to keep the value of resources. Although in Europe, circular economy principles have become a trend much earlier, CACs still face challenges in adopting them. The current research aims to review the available literature on sustainability, green economy, and circularity development through the adoption of political, industrial, and financial instruments, followed by an assessment of the barriers and opportunities to circular economy development in the CACs. The novelty of this research lies in the systematic review of different state-of-the-art data resources (journal papers, policies, news, and reports) of CACs by different categories: policy regulations, energy, waste, education, water, and agriculture. This research addresses that the CACs have similar circular economy development barriers (e.g., wide use of fossil fuels, water shortage, and lack of effective waste management) and opportunities (e.g., orientation towards sustainable development, foreign cooperation, and green financing). Therefore, performing effective strategic plans that are already directed to circularity, ensuring stakeholders' involvement, and providing sufficient funding could benefit their circular economy development.

AB  - Purpose Wine tourism has stood out as a very recognized and valid tourism and marketing segment, growing worldwide and urging the complex needed advances on wine tourism practices performance. This paper aims to develop a new framework strictly applied to the global wine tourism system, taking into account emerging and future constructs and dimensions that precede and consequence it. Design/methodology/approach The systematic mapping study (SMS) was adopted as the selected research methodological approach, both to analyze and to structure a broad research field concerning methods, designs and research, focuses on the papers published in reliable academic databases such as Emerald, ProQuest, Sage, Science Direct, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, Taylor and Francis and Wiley were properly selected and analyzed. Findings The following four dimensions were found to comprise the global framework of the wine tourism system: (1) support features (governance, public policies and economic investment; supply development; physical and capacity conditions; requirements of health safety; opinion makers and leaders: managers/stakeholders/players/marketers and benchmarking and value chain); (2) innovation ecosystem (profile of the new generations of wine tourists; virtual and augmented reality: digital and hybrid wine events; smart wine tourism companies; digital channels and platforms: blogs, websites, applications; wine tourism creative activities for all [from kids to seniors] and sustainable and ecologic wine tourism practices); (3) wine tourism experience dimensions (storytelling; involvement; winescape; attachment; emotions and sensory) and (4) behavioural intentions (satisfaction; loyalty; and WoM). Research limitations/implications The framework still needs to be empirically applied in wine tourism settings to enrich tourists' robustness in cross-cultural wine tourism experiences, covering a wider spread of abroad wine tourism destinations and products. Practical implications This framework is a useful tool and becomes vital to their continued success, as a key reference of wine tourism management and marketing. As a wine tourist's visitation frequency plays a role in his/her travel motives, product and service quality of tour packages must be improved and monitored. Originality/value This is the first research study to demonstrate the combined use of the main domains forming the wine tourism system within a global perspective, covering of the most critical aspects.

AB  - Hematological malignancies require intensive and long-term treatment, which brings a significant burden on patients, leading to unmet supportive care needs. The purpose of this review was to investigate the unmet supportive care needs of patients with hematological malignancies during and after active treatment as well as the factors that affect them. A systematic bibliographic search was carried out in the PubMed database for English articles published between 2009 and 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines and under the terms: "unmet needs", "supportive care", "hematological malignancy" and "hematological cancer." Twenty studies were evaluated and reviewed. Hierarchical frequently reported unmet supportive care needs were informational, emotional, physical, daily living/practical (accessibility, transportation, and financial problems), and family life/relational needs. In particular, patients with multiple myeloma most frequently reported unmet needs at the informational, physical, emotional, and daily living/practical domain. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes reported physical, emotional, practical, and relational needs. Patients with leukemia and lymphoma rated their needs as informational, physical, psychological, daily living, and sexual. Sexual and spiritual unmet needs were reported at a low level. Predictive indicators for increased unmet supportive care needs were the type of the hematological malignancy, younger age, marital status, female gender, monthly income, coexistence of anxiety and depression, and altered quality of life. To conclude with, the literature reports a significant number of unmet supportive care needs in patients with hematological malignancies, whose frequency and intensity were influenced by a variety of factors. However, the large heterogeneity of studies (design, sample, and needs assessment tools) makes the generalization of the results difficult.

AB  - The diversity, spread, and evolution of parasites in non-human primates (NHPs) is a relevant issue for human public health as well as for NHPs conservation. Although previous reviews have recorded information on parasites in NHPs (Platyrrhines) in the Americas, the increasing number of recent studies has made these inventories far from complete. Here, we summarize information about parasites recently reported in Platyrrhines, attempting to build on earlier reviews and identify information gaps. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Ninety-three studies were included after the screening process. Records for 20 genera of NHPs, including 90 species were found. Most of the studies were conducted on captive individuals (54.1%), and morphological approaches were the most used for parasite identification. The most commonly collected biological samples were blood and stool, and Protozoa was the most frequent parasite group found. There is still scarce (if any) information on the parasites associated to several Platyrrhine species, especially for free-ranging populations. The use of molecular identification methods can provide important contributions to the field of NHPs parasitology in the near future. Finally, the identification of parasites in NHPs populations will continue to provide relevant information in the context of pervasive habitat loss and fragmentation that should influence both human public health and wildlife conservation strategies.

AB  - Purpose Trust has emerged as a crucial research topic in the sharing economy. However, scholarship on trust in sharing accommodation remains limited. By using stakeholder theory, this study aims to provide a systematic framework for integrating trust among multiple stakeholders and identify potential knowledge gaps and future research directions for trust in sharing accommodation. Design/methodology/approach The authors select papers using a combination of multiple keywords from EBSCOhost and Web of Science. The analysis includes 172 journal papers published between 2011 and 2021. The authors conduct a systematic review through thematic content analysis, and each paper is analyzed using manual coding. Findings The analysis shows that key stakeholders for trust building in sharing accommodation include consumers, hosts, platforms, residents and governments, with most studies focusing on the consumer perspective. The study integrates various trust antecedents and outcomes from the above multistakeholder. Second, this study summarizes the most commonly used theories, and more diversified theories could be applied to future research. Third, this study finds that most studies use quantitative methods, and researchers should introduce more integrated methodologies such as machine learning on a large scale. Furthermore, the current research disciplinary paradigm should be extended to multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to promote innovation in trust research. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought both challenges and opportunities to industry as well as researchers, and more institutional rather than commercial perspectives need to be addressed. Research limitations/implications The study contributes to the trust and the sharing economy literature by providing a systematic framework for integrating trust from multistakeholder perspectives. The study also points out several future research directions by combining micro and macro multistakeholder perspectives, identifying more diversified theories and methodologies and specifying multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches. Originality/value The study advances knowledge by providing a systematic framework for integrating trust among multiple stakeholders and proposing future research directions for trust in sharing accommodation.

AB  - As the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) is a tool to simulate the interactions between ecological and hydrological processes, many RHESSys-based studies have been implemented for sustainable watershed management. However, it is crucial to review a RHESSys updating history, pros, and cons for further improving the RHESSys and promoting ecohydrological studies. This paper reviewed the progress of ecohydrological studies employing RHESSys by a bibliometric analysis that quantitatively analyzed the characteristics of relevant studies. In addition, we addressed the main application progress, parameter calibration and validation methods, and uncertainty analysis. We found that since its release in 1993, RHESSys has been widely applied for basins (<100 km(2)) within mainly seven biomes. The RHESSys model has been applied for evaluating the ecohydrological responses to climate change, land management, urbanization, and disturbances, as well as water quality and biogeochemical cycle. While most studies have paid their attention on climate change, the focus has shifted to the application for land management in recent years. This study also identified many challenges in RHESSys such as the inaccessible data and parameters, oversimplified calibration approach, few applications for large-scale watersheds, and limited application fields. Therefore, this study proposed a set of suggestions to overcome the limitations and challenges: (1) Developing a new approach for parameter acquisition and calibration from multi-source data, (2) improving the applicability for a large-scale basin, and (3) extending the scope of application fields. We believe RHESSys can improve the understandings of human-environment relationships and the promotion of sustainable watersheds development.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Fibrinolytic agents and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are the main approaches for the recanalization and reperfusion of the myocardium following MI. Many studies have shown that PCI is superior to thrombolytics due to better outcomes and decreased mortality. Nevertheless, PCI's mortality gain over thrombolysis decreases as the time between presentation and PCI procedure increases. Furthermore, PCI is not widely available in most developing countries; thus, it cannot be delivered promptly. Most patients in developing countries cannot afford the cost of PCI. Thus, thrombolytic therapy remains essential to managing MI in developing countries and should not be disregarded. Tenecteplase (TNK) and streptokinase (SK) are the two most widely used fibrinolytics in managing MI in underdeveloped nations. Despite their widespread availability, comparative studies on them have been inconclusive.
   This study aims to review the available literature on the effectiveness and safety of TNK versus SK in managing MI in resource-poor nations. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) extension and analyzed according to Cochrane guidelines on synthesis without meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search for studies comparing TNK and STK was conducted on EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Ovid version of MEDLINE databases. A reference list of the eligible articles and systematic reviews was also screened. A narrative synthesis of the available data was done by representing the data on the effect direction plot, followed by vote counting.
   Of the 2284 references retrieved from the databases, only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for final analysis. The study suggested that TNK is more effective in complete ST-segment resolution (80% vs 10% on the effect direction plot) and symptom relief (80% vs 20%) than SK. SK and TNK were comparable in achieving successful fibrinolysis (50% vs 50%). For the safety parameters, TNK is associated with a lesser risk of major bleeding than SK (88.9% vs 11.1%) and minor bleeding (25% vs 75%). SK was linked with a higher risk of hypotension/shock (77.8% vs 11.1%) and anaphylaxis/allergy (100% vs 0%). Long-term mortality was higher in the SK arm (100% vs 0%). In-hospital mortality is comparable between the two agents (37.5% vs 37.5%). There is conflicting evidence regarding other safety and efficacy endpoints.
   Compared to SK, TNK results in better complete ST-segment resolution and symptom relief. A higher risk of long-term mortality, increased risk of major and minor bleeding, hypotension, and allergy/anaphylaxis was observed in patients who received SK. Both agents were comparable in terms of in-hospital mortality and successful fibrinolysis. Controversy exists regarding which agent is linked with increased risk of 30-35-day mortality benefit and stroke. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes are needed to establish TNK vs SK superiority in efficacy and safety. The long-term duration of follow-up of the mortality rate of the two agents is also essential, as most patients in these regions cannot afford the recommended PCI post-fibrinolysis.

AB  - This study attempts to enlighten the status of scenario planning studies and their content through a systematic literature review. A search of major databases (Scopus and Web of Science) was performed to determine relevant articles. Fifty-seven articles were identified and analysed according to their categories, themes, topics, and methods-techniques. Based on the content analysis of studies, two main categories, including seven themes, were identified: internal complexity of tourism (tourism planning and development, tourism education, tourism demand forecasting, and tourism types), external uncertainties (climate change and green economy, health care and security, and social media impacts). Though not many studies found, the categories, themes, topics and, methods-techniques of scenario planning studies in tourism and hospitality varies. However, there is still a need for scenario planning studies in tourism and hospitality literature. In this vein, an important implication of this study is that much remains to be done in benefiting from the scenario planning approach to contribute crisis management knowledge in tourism and hospitality research.

AB  - The worldwide Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for smart cities and communities focus significant attention on air quality and climate change. Technology and management can reduce fossil fuel dependence in smart cities' energy supply chains (SC). A sustainable smart city and reduced carbon emissions require coordinated technology and management with appropriate infrastructure. A systematic review of smart city SC management literature that reduces the carbon footprint (C.F) inspired this study. The study shows how each attribute reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Introduction highlights the subject matter and principal goal, which is to investigate how SC management strategies could assist smart cities in lowering their C.F. The Methods and Materials section provides a succinct description of the refining process in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) relevant to C.F mitigation in smart city (SC) management. Significant works are described in the Results and Findings section, which exposes how smart cities and SC measurements reduce C.F. The Discussion section examines and scientifically debates the research findings. The Conclusion provides a scientific analysis based on the presented insights and features to enhance how policies must be coordinated to achieve the goal of this research study in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for practitioners and governments, and proposals for future research. The main contribution of this paper is conducting and proposing a framework for a better understanding of how the novel digital SCs, their components, and their management practices can help smart cities reduce their C.F.

AB  - Ground-breeding farmland birds are disproportionately negatively affected by the impact of agricultural intensification and mostly still dramatically declining in Europe. One main reason for this decline is the lack of suitable nesting sites. While some off-field measures showed positive effects on bird productivity, we are currently not achieving sufficient conservation with these, so that supplementing them with in-field measures seems inevitable. Over the past years, several in-field measures have been developed aiming at providing suitable nesting sites in crop fields by manipulating the crop architecture, i.e., the density and/or height of the crops. However, we currently lack an overview on what has been tested and resulted in stabilizing population of ground-breeding farmland birds. In this systematic review, we provide a qualitative assessment of current knowledge and knowledge gaps on such in-field measures and their effects on European crop-breeding farmland birds. In doing so, we accounted for specific birds' requirements on their breeding habitat. We found only very few studies on the effectiveness of crop architecture-related in-field measures on ground-breeding farmland birds. Knowledge gaps exist for effects on individual species in general, their reproduction (rather than population density), the influence of landscape and local contexts on the effectiveness, and the optimal spatial arrangement of measures to maximize their efficiency. This shows an urgent need for more research on a holistic scale. However, the few existing studies suggest, that there is a high potential for crop architecture-related infield measures to promote ground-breeding farmland birds, and thus bring them back as 'agricultural byproducts'.

AB  - Academic and corporate interest in ethical leadership, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and firm performance has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. In fact, many research papers and journal special issues have been focused on these three domains. In this context, this paper conducts a systematic review on the concepts of ethical leadership and CSR and their impact on firm performance. 114 papers published over a period of 58 years (1958-2016) were selected and analyzed according to descriptive and content perspectives to propose a conceptual framework and define a future research agenda. In fact, the main results allow us to derive six main propositions representing possible areas of investigation to direct research on the topic. More in details, the body of literature highlights that financial factors are the main barriers affecting the adoption of CSR practices. On the contrary, internal and external environment was found to represent a critical success factor in the adoption of CSR practices. Finally, the results highlight that personal values have impact on ethical leadership that in turn has direct positive impact on CSR and direct and indirect impact on firm performance.

AB  - In recent decades, significant research has been devoted to optimizing sustainable energies to improve their technical performance, economic profitability, and social acceptance. Despite the development and application of numerous heuristic algorithms in the field of sustainable energy, a systematic review of the most popular solvers remains scarce. Therefore, this study developed a Boolean logic-based program in three keyword blocks to conduct a literature search for the applications of heuristic solvers in sustainable energy, investigating their geographic- and topic-based popularity and exploring the factors contributing to their success. After describing the basic concepts and terminology of optimization, the generic applications of 28 standard heuristic algorithms in the current literature on renewable energy were assessed, from which particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms exhibited superior performance. Therefore, the history, structure, and variants of these two algorithms were extensively analyzed to understand the reasons behind their frequent applications in three major sustainable engineering fields: energy integration, buildings, and transportation. The search results revealed that the distinguished articles typically employed the multiobjective and hybrid variants of the two algorithms. The primary impetus for their development was the familiarity of the employing communities rather than the type of optimization problems or search spaces. The first authors were mainly affiliated with China, India, Iran, and the United States, whereas the active higher education institutes were distributed in several regions without a regular pattern. Considering their productive role in publishing advanced research, open-source journals are expected to spearhead future research in this field.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes and obesity are serious public health concerns globally and a growing burden in Africa. Both conditions have serious repercussions on health when they co-occur, yet the extent of their co-occurrence in Africa remains unknown. Therefore, this review aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors of overweight and obesity among persons with type 2 diabetes in Africa. Method A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, African Index Medicus (AIM), and African Journals Online (AJOL) for observational studies that reported the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity among type 2 diabetes patients in Africa. The prevalence data from individual studies were aggregated through a random-effects meta-analysis. The I (2) statistic was used to evaluate between-studies heterogeneity, while subgroup analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's test. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Of 1753 records retrieved, 80 articles were eligible for this review, with 74 cross-sectional studies included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity was 35.6% and 25.6% respectively, while the overall prevalence of both overweight and obesity was 61.4%. Also, the pooled prevalence of both overweight and obesity across the five geographical areas in Africa ranged from 56.9% in East Africa to 88.5% in Southern Africa. Nineteen factors were significantly associated with overweight and obesity among patients with type 2 diabetes. Conclusion The high prevalence of overweight and obesity among patients with type 2 diabetes is a significant public health concern that transcends geographical boundaries within Africa. The findings from this review highlight the need for innovative weight management interventions that are tailored to the cultural context of the African setting. KEY MESSAGES There was a high prevalence of overweight and obesity among the type 2 diabetes patients. Nineteen factors were identified to be significantly associated with overweight and obesity among type 2 diabetes patients. Only 12 out of the 80 included studies primarily focused on the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity which reflects a dearth of interest in this topic.

AB  - This article reviews important and diverse issues that can affect family business goals, which scholars can consider in their future research. A systematic review was undertaken in three different areas: family businesses goals, sustainable supply chain and platform economy. The three topics were reviewed in terms of the theories utilised in the studied articles. Two theories (institutional and social exchange) were found to be common across the three topics. As a result, family businesses goals, sustainable supply chain and platform economy were reviewed through the lenses of the institutional and social exchange theories. We conclude by discussing directions for future research and other promising approaches, so as to inform the investigation concerning family businesses, and the expected contemporary goals to pursue in relation to sustainable supply chain and platform economy.

AB  - Transboundary hydropower dams are sources of hydroelectricity supply that sit in shared international rivers or watersheds, and/or generate benefits and costs that flow across national borders. Scholars have been exploring the impacts of hydropower dams at a local, regional and national scale for decades, however the transboundary impacts of hydropower ventures have been less studied. Nonetheless, the advent of a new hydropower boom, where a large proportion of untapped hydropower potential lies in transboundary settings, means that there is a need to better understand the specific benefits and costs in those contexts to foster more equitable and just outcomes, and to better examine the dynamics shaping the future of hydroelectricity. To depict the state-of-the-art within this critical field of research, we conduct a systematic review of 1264 peer-reviewed articles published on transboundary hydropower dams from 2009 to 2019. We find that most studies in our sample focus on issues related to water management and water allocation, whereas fewer focus on the scope of hydropower benefits, their temporal and spatial variation, and equity and justice dimensions. Moreover, there is minimal exploration of how differences in relative economic and financial capabilities can impact the distribution of transboundary hydropower benefits. Whether transboundary hydropower dams lead to optimal outcomes is highly dependent on underlying benefit sharing arrangements as well as an explicit acknowledgement and tackling of governance asymmetries. The study concludes that there is an urgent need to systematically assess these conditions to favour just outcomes for all stakeholders.

AB  - Water use and sustainable development are pressing issues that affect the overall global system. The economic analysis of water use has been receiving increasing attention among researchers and has become an important field of research in recent decades. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the worldwide dynamics of economic studies on water use in the last 30 years and especially on its sustainable use. A systematic review and a bibliometric analysis were developed to sample 1022 articles. The results indicate that the number of articles published has increased steadily each year, especially in the last five years, accounting for 45% of all the articles. The three most prominent journals in this field are Journal of Cleaner Production, Resources Conservation and Recycling and Ecological Economics. Of the articles studied, 23.5% were published in the United States, 13.6% in Australia and 8.1% in China. The need to create comprehensive and multidisciplinary frameworks of analysis has been detected in order to develop holistic models for a sustainable management of water resources. These models must analyse supply and demand, non-conventional water sources and a global approach to the questions of water. In short, this study is that it can be stated that the economic analysis of water use is a field of research which is growing worldwide, and within this research field the analysis devoted to sustainability is increasingly relevant. The findings of this study can be useful to water use researchers by providing an overview of the worldwide research on this line of investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a systematic review that analysed the literature on factors influencing societal acceptance and stakeholders' perceptions of hydrogen related technologies. This study found that the most influencing factors include prior knowledge, perceived cost/risks, environmental knowledge, higher education and income, personal and distributive benefits, infrastructure availability and close proximity to hydrogen fa-cilities. There was low hydrogen awareness in more than 60% of the countries analysed in the reviewed studies. Although stakeholders had diverse perceptions, there was agreement that infrastructure availability, affordability, local community engagement, regional skill capability development, preservation of biodiversity, and safety and distributive benefits to the community were essential for a successful hydrogen industry. Future research could examine consumer acceptance at different geographical scales, analyse pre-and post-hydrogen project implementation, and social impact of hydrogen infrastructure on local communities. We also recommend diversifying hydrogen research projects and investi-gating the policy and regulatory arrangements for community-owned hydrogen projects. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - As offshore windfarm (OWF) construction in the UK is progressing rapidly, monitoring of the economic and ecological effects of these developments is urgently needed. This is to enable both spatial planning and where necessary mitigation in an increasingly crowded marine environment. One approach to mitigation is co-location of OWFs and marine protected areas (MPAs). This systematic review has the objective to inform this co-location proposal and identify areas requiring further research. A limited number of studies addressing marine renewable energy structures and related artificial structures in coastal waters were found. The results of these studies display a change in species assemblages at artificial structures in comparison to naturally occurring habitats. An increase in hard substrata associated species, especially benthic bivalves, crustaceans and reef associated fish and a decrease in algae abundance were the dominant trends. Assemblages associated with complex concrete structures revealed greater similarity to natural hard substrata compared to those around steel structures. To consider marine renewable energy sites, especially large scale OWFs as MPAs, the dissimilar nature of assemblages on the structures themselves to natural communities should be considered. However positive effects were recorded on the abundance of commercially important crustacean species. This suggests potential for incorporation of OWFs as no fishing, or restricted activity zones within a wider MPA to aid fisheries augmentation. The limited available evidence highlights a requirement for significant further research involving long term monitoring at a variety of sites to better inform management options.

AB  - The literature on common-pool resources (CPRs) has mostly focused on institutional conditions for successful governance of the commons. However, many scholars have emphasized that the explanatory power of institutional variables per se is limited and that institutions should not be isolated from the context in which they operate. Consequently, the success of CPR governance requires a more nuanced understanding of specific combinations of institutions in a specific social-ecological context. Using community based irrigation systems as an example, this paper examines how combinations of institutions and contexts affect irrigation governance based on a qualitative systematic review of 83 English language peer-reviewed articles published since 1990. The review firstly summarizes the basic characteristics, main research subjects, and development trends in the literature on community-based irrigation governance. Then, revealing the specific effects of major combinations of institutional variables and contextual variables on the performance of irrigation governance, the review suggests that (a) the congruence of institutional arrangements with attributes of actors (e.g., group size, group heterogeneity, and social capital), (b) the specific combination of institutions and contexts of resource system and related ecosystems (e.g., hydrology, soil, and agriculture), and (c) the market incentives (e.g., irrigation systems' spatial proximity to markets) associating with formal governance organizations, are important for improving irrigation governance performance. The main findings not only reveal existing gaps in understanding how institutions and contexts interact in community-based irrigation governance, but also indicate potential pathways to theoretical construction in complex CPR systems by further exploring the relationships between institutions and the contexts in which they operate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearing lumbosacral orthosis (LSO) is one of the most common treatments prescribed for conservative management of low back pain. Although the results of randomized controlled trials suggest effectiveness of LSO in reducing pain and disability in these patients, there is a concern that prolonged use of LSO may lead to trunk muscle weakness and atrophy.
   PURPOSE: The present review aimed to evaluate available evidence in literature to determine whether LSO results in trunk muscle weakness or atrophy.
   STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review.
   METHODS: Asystematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Medline (via Ovid) followed by hand search of journals was performed. Prospective studies published in peer-reviewed journals, with full text available in English, investigating the effect of lumbar orthosis on trunk muscle activity, muscle thickness, strength or endurance, spinal force, and intraabdominal pressure in healthy subjects or in patients with low back pain, were included. Methodological quality of selected studies was assessed by using the modified version of Downs and Black checklist. This research had no funding source, and the authors declare no conflicts of interest-associated biases.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The mean and standard deviation of the quality score was 64 +/- 9.7%. Most studies investigating the effect of lumbar orthosis on electromyographic activity (EMG) of trunk muscles demonstrated a decrease or no change in the EMG parameters. Afew studies reported increased muscle activity. Lumbosacral orthosis was found to have no effect on muscle strength in some studies, whereas other studies demonstrated increased muscle strength. Only one study, which included ultrasound assessment of trunk muscle stabilizers, suggested reduced thickness of the abdominal muscles and reduced cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscles. Out of eight studies that investigated spinal compression load, the load was reduced in four studies and unchanged in three studies. One study showed that only elastic belts reduced compression force compared to leather and fabric belts and ascribed this reduction to the elastic property of the lumbar support.
   CONCLUSION: The present review showed that the changes in outcome measures associated with muscle work demands were inconsistent in their relation to the use of lumbar supports. This review did not find conclusive scientific evidence to suggest that orthosis results in trunk muscle weakness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass is a valuable renewable source of energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. The main barriers in biomass and biofuel development are feedstock high cost, lack of reliable supply, and uncertainties. A systematic review of comprehensive solution tools to overcome the biomass supply chain (BSC) planning challenges is critical for both academic research and industry. Therefore, the aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of BSC modeling and optimization and identify future research directions. We reviewed 300 papers that have been published in the past 40 years on this topic to assess the various models of BSCs, their objective functions, solution approaches, and decision levels employed. Results show that researchers are motivated to use mixed integer programming models for BSC problems because of the complexities of nonlinear models, as well as the simplicity of the linear approaches. There is a lack of multi-objective optimization approaches to address the economic, social, and environmental issues simultaneously in BSC. Although factors such as the political regulation, governmental subsidy, impact of biomass and oil price and cost of raw material are uncertain, most studies formally treat only the supply and demand of biomass as uncertain parameters. It is highly recommended that an integrated and holistic model that consider all facilities in the whole BSC be developed and tested with real data. In addition, incorporating strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels in the model is suggested to address the challenges of incorporating day-to-day inventory control and fleet management issues.

AB  - The greatest extent of Afromontane environments in the world is found in Ethiopia. These areas support exceptional biodiversity, but forest cover and ecological integrity have declined sharply in recent decades. Conservation and management efforts are hampered in part by an inadequate understanding of the basic ecology of major tree species. We investigated population structure and inferred population dynamics from size frequency distributions of 22 forest tree species encountered in montane forests of Ethiopia. We collected new empirical data from four sites in the Bale Mountains, where some of the country's most extensive and least disturbed forests remain, and conducted a systematic review and analysis of all such studies that reported population structure for one or more of these species in Ethiopia. Thirteen widespread montane tree species showed a reverse-J size distribution, indicating a relatively stable population structure. Six other species had size-frequency distributions that indicate episodic recruitment and/or removal of certain size classes. Specific causes of these patterns are uncertain: they may involve timber harvesting, herbivory, fire, or natural disturbances, but patterns were inconsistent and locality dependent. For three other tree species, existing data are inadequate for any interpretation of population structure and dynamics. A species of particular conservation concern that emerged from this analysis was Hagenia abyssinica, which was found in all areas to consist only of larger individuals with no recent recruitment. For management and conservation purposes, the species in most urgent need of new research are those with inadequate or inconsistent data, and H.abyssinica.

AB  - IntroductionThis systematic review summarizes the maternal health experiences and healthcare utilization of African immigrant women who have immigrated to the United States using an adapted version of the healthcare utilization model.MethodsPublished journal articles from the year 2000 to 2022 were identified from seven large databases; 13 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria.ResultsThe results of the study are reported according to the individual and contextual factors for healthcare utilization for African immigrant women in the United States. Individual factors that facilitated the use of maternal healthcare were having transportation, higher health literacy levels, insurance, and family support. Contextual factors that facilitated maternal health utilization included access to interpreters and female doctors.DiscussionFacilitators and barriers to maternal health utilization were impacted by cultural and environmental factors. First, African immigrant women included in the studies, believe pregnancy and childbirth are safe and normal, therefore prenatal care is unnecessary. Second, the fear of obstetrical interventions, especially from women who have had female genital mutilation. Third, the misconceptions regarding pain medications and the roles of hospital staff. Further research is necessary for addressing the facilitators and barriers to healthcare utilization in African immigrant women.
   SignificanceMigration is an important social determinant of health that can greatly affect health outcomes. Despite the advances in maternal and child health in the United States, women who migrate from Africa to the United States from low or middle-income countries often face maternal healthcare challenges. The maternal healthcare utilization of African immigrant women is important as pregnancy often constitutes a period of increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes. African immigrant women experience adverse maternal health outcomes following their migration which is not explained by maternal risk factors alone. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the maternal health experiences and healthcare utilization for African immigrant women. This systematic review summarized research on the maternal health experiences of African immigrant women and how these experiences facilitate or hinder the use of maternal health services.

AB  - Monitoring water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) is important to track progress, improve accountability, and demonstrate impacts of efforts to improve conditions and services, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Indicator selection methods enable robust monitoring of WaSH projects and conditions. However, selection methods are not always used and there are no commonly-used methods for selecting WaSH indicators. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of indicator selection methods used in WaSH-related fields. We present a summary of indicator selection methods for environment, international development, and water. We identified six methodological stages for selecting indicators for WaSH: define the purpose and scope; select a conceptual framework; search for candidate indicators; determine selection criteria; score indicators against criteria; and select a final suite of indicators. This summary of indicator selection methods provides a foundation for the critical assessment of existing methods. It can be used to inform future efforts to construct indicator sets in WaSH and related fields.

   PURPOSE: This study aimed to update findings of the NPTF and evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the management of neck pain and associated disorders (NAD) or whiplashassociated disorders (WAD).
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This study used systematic review and best-evidence synthesis.
   SAMPLE: Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies comparing psychological interventions to other non-invasive interventions or no intervention were the samples used in this study.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures are (1) self-rated recovery; (2) functional recovery; (3) clinical outcomes; (4) administrative outcomes; and (5) adverse effects.
   METHODS: We searched six databases from 1990 to 2015. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case- control studies meeting our selection criteria were eligible for critical appraisal. Random pairs of independent reviewers used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria to critically appraise eligible studies. Studies with a low risk of bias were synthesized following best evidence synthesis principles. This study was funded by the Ontario Ministry of Finance.
   RESULTS: We screened 1,919 articles, 19 were eligible for critical appraisal and 10 were judged to have low risk of bias. We found no clear evidence supporting relaxation training or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for persistent grades I-III NAD for reducing pain intensity or disability. Similarly, we did not find evidence to support the effectiveness of biofeedback or relaxation training for persistent grade IIWAD, and there is conflicting evidence for the use of CBT in this population. However, adding a progressive goal attainment program to functional restoration physiotherapy may benefit patients with persistent grades I-IIIWAD. Furthermore, Jyoti meditation may help reduce neck pain intensity and bothersomeness in patients with persistent NAD.
   CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence for or against the use of psychological interventions in patients with recent onset NAD or WAD. We found evidence that a progressive goal attainment program may be helpful for the management of persistentWAD and that Jyoti meditation may benefit patients with persistent NAD. The limited evidence of effectiveness for psychological interventions may be due to several factors, such as interventions that are ineffective, poorly conceptualized, or poorly implemented. Further methodologically rigorous research is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Various trials and meta-analyses have reported conflicting results concerning the application of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) for sepsis and septic shock. The aim of this study was to update the evidence by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Multiple databases were searched from initial through August, 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the associations between the use of EGDT and mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model and heterogeneity was examined through subgroup analyses. The primary outcome of interest was patient all-cause mortality including hospital or ICU mortality. Seventeen RCTs including 6207 participants with 3234 in the EGDT group and 2973 in the control group were eligible for this study. Meta-analysis showed that EGDT did not significantly reduce hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02) compared with control group for patients with sepsis or septic shock. The findings of subgroup analyses stratified by study region, number of research center, year of enrollment, clinical setting, sample size, timing of EGDT almost remained constant with that of the primary analysis. Our findings provide evidence that EGDT offers neutral survival effects for patients with sepsis or septic shock. Further meta-analyses based on larger well-designed RCTs or individual patient data meta-analysis are required to explore the survival benefits of EDGT in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are primary vectors of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Ae. aegypti is highly anthropophilic and relies nearly exclusively on human blood meals and habitats for reproduction. Socioeconomic factors may be associated with the spread of Ae. aegypti due to their close relationship with humans. This paper describes and summarizes the published literature on the association between socioeconomic variables and the distribution of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the mainland United States. A comprehensive search of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO Academic Search Complete through June 12, 2019 was used to retrieve all articles published in English on the association of socioeconomic factors and the distribution of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Additionally, a hand search of mosquito control association websites was conducted in an attempt to identify relevant grey literature. Articles were screened for eligibility using the process described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Initially, 3,493 articles were identified through the database searches and previously known literature. After checking for duplicates, 2,145 articles remained. 570 additional records were identified through the grey literature search for a total of 2,715 articles. These articles were screened for eligibility using their titles and abstracts, and 2,677 articles were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria. Finally, the full text for each of the remaining articles (n=38) was read to determine eligibility. Through this screening process, 11 articles were identified for inclusion in this review. The findings for these 11 studies revealed inconsistent relationships between the studied socioeconomic factors and the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti. The findings of this review suggest a gap in the literature and understanding of the association between anthropogenic factors and the distribution of Ae. aegypti that could hinder efforts to implement effective public health prevention and control strategies should a disease outbreak occur.

AB  - Eco-innovation has become an essential entity for greening the economy. Technological innovations, institutional reforms, and change in social practices are some of the means of eco-innovation. As a result, there is a wide discourse on the many dimensions of eco-innovation since the dawn of the millennium. However, the concept of eco-innovation lacks theoretical consistency; hence, it has remained narrow and disintegrated. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review of the articles focusing on the significance of theories in relation to the process of eco-innovation, in order to investigate the evolving theories of eco-innovation, highlight the existing research gaps, and to identify directions for potential theoretical development that would be valuable for a deeper system change. The findings show resource-based view, institutional theory, stakeholders theory, and evolutionary theory to be the most commonly used theories, along with identification of material-based enterprises as the primary sectors of implementation exhibiting a strong technological bias. The findings indicate that eco-innovations are primarily perceived from a narrow set of neo-liberal notions that although is effective for incremental improvements, lack credibility for defining the differentiated approach associated with radical eco-innovations. Accordingly, selective pressure by means of policy making process, design dynamic, and societal demand are identified as gray areas requiring greater theoretical attention. An analytical framework built on technological, institutional, organizational and social ecoinnovation is represented for exploring the research areas of system change, economic sustainability, product network sustainability, and socio-technical landscape, that facilitates sustainability transition.

AB  - Urban growth has compromised the capacity of ecosystem services (ES), causing impacts such as degradation, urban heat islands, climate change and floods. Importance of ES can help improve their condition and management through political and urban planning instruments. This study was developed by reviewing the literature using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses disclosure guidelines to identify ES valuation methods based on the total economic value (TEV) framework. The literature review included 117 articles that (a) were based on the TEV framework and (b) offered quantitative results. The results show that: (a) 52 studies evaluated more than one ES and that the regulation service is the most investigated, (b) the contingent valuation method is the most used and the least used was the production function and (c) that 78 of the 117 studies conclude with proposals for the implementation of public policies, of which conservation, protection and restoration policies are the most important and the method most used for public proposals was the contingent valuation method. It is essential to mention that implementation of ES valuation in urban planning benefits users and ecosystems.

AB  - Globally, billions of people and their livelihood are threatened by the onset of COVID-19. In Nepal, resource-poor people who lost their job were the hardest hit among millions of impacted populations. Further, the associated effects of pandemics are food supply chain interruption and people's inferior physical and mental wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts have questioned Nepal's ability to achieve the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the post-pandemic era. Yet no scientific studies available to see COVID-19 and SDGs relationships in Nepal, government reports, and macroeconomic updates indicated that COVID-19 is likely to deter significantly in achieving SDGs targets. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal's macro-economy from March 2020 to December 2021. Our study indicated that the COVID-19 exerted inevitable challenges in achieving SDGs targets in terms of food security and household poverty. Therefore, this paper recommended creating more employment opportunities in the domestic economy and establishing a resilient food system.

AB  - Objective To systematically review published research studies and ongoing clinical trials investigating nitrous oxide (N2O) in psychiatric disorders, providing an up-to-date snapshot of the clinical research landscape. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published until June 2021 using the OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo) and the clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Results In total, five relevant published articles were identified, among which four investigated N2O for depression. One single-dose randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), one triple crossover RCT comparing 50% vs. 25% N2O for TRD, and one repeated-dose RCT for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that N2O has preliminary feasibility with rapid-acting effects on symptoms of depression. From the public registries, 10 relevant ongoing clinical trials were identified. They aim to explore the use of N2O for MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. To date, the typical treatment protocol parameters were a single session of 50% N2O delivered for 60 min, although the concentration of 25% is also being explored. Projected enrolment numbers for ongoing trials (M = 55.0) were much higher than sample sizes for published studies (M = 13.0), suggesting that there potentially will be more large-scale RCTs published in the next few years. Conclusion Preliminary studies support the feasibility of administering N2O for depression; however, appropriate blinding is a critical challenge. Larger-scale RCTs with repeated doses of N2O and follow-up times beyond 1 month are needed to confirm the feasibility, therapeutic efficacy, and sustainability of response.

AB  - Paper has shaped society for centuries and is considered one of humanity's most important inventions. However, pulp and paper products can be damaging to social and natural systems along their lifecycle of material extraction, processing, transportation, and waste handling. The pulp and paper industry is among the top five most energy-intensive industries globally and is the fourth largest industrial energy user. This industry accounts for approximately 6% of global industrial energy use and 2% of direct industrial CO2 emissions. The pulp and paper industry is also the largest user of original or virgin wood, with deleterious impacts on both human health and local flora and fauna, including aquatic ecosystems. This critical and systematic review seeks to identify alternatives for mitigating the climate impacts of pulp and paper processes and products, thus making the pulp and paper industry more environmentally sustainable. This study reviews 466 studies to answer the following questions: what are the main determinants of energy and carbon emissions emerging from the pulp and paper industry? What are the benefits of this industry adopting low-carbon manufacturing processes, and what barriers will need to be tackled to enable such adoption? Using a sociotechnical lens, we answer these questions, identify barriers for the pulp and paper industry's decarbonization, and present promising avenues for future research.

AB  - The European Commission's strategic long-term vision for 2050, "A Clean Planet for All", identifies the bioeconomy and the circular economy as key strategic areas for achieving a climate-neutral economy. Focus is given to the sustainability of biomass and the circularity of materials. However, in order to facilitate the transition toward a sustainable bio-based circular economy and to unlock its potential, strong accompanying measures are required. These should be designed based on a systematic understanding of transition drivers and barriers. This paper, after providing a systematic review of transition research on the circular bioeconomy, focuses on the identification and classification of transition barriers, clustering them into relevant categories. Moreover, it provides a comparison of the barriers identified by various frameworks.

AB  - The blue economy concept has been discussed at high-level policy fora since the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Simultaneously, a burgeoning body of literature on the blue economy is emerging from academia. This scoping analysis uses data from journal articles and policy documents to provide a preliminary understanding of how small-scale fisheries in the blue economy are framed by academics and policy makers. We found that high-level policies include ideal proposals for fisheries and other ocean sectors, but in ways that suit industrial-scale fisheries and aquaculture more than small-scale fisheries. Academics highlight emerging uncertainties for small-scale fisheries. The review points out differences between small-scale and industrial-scale fisheries, particularly the social aspects that could make small-scale fisheries more suitable for achieving some of the stated goals of a blue economy. We conclude that, while the blue economy in its broadest sense is still a work in progress, it should be guided by clearly articulated goals in terms of governance that supports small-scale fisheries.

AB  - Inspired by Mark Plummer's legacy of questioning conservation and environmental orthodoxy, we challenge several common conservation memes and patterns of thinking. First, we argue that framing conservation messages as crises typically is not an effective strategy. Second, we question conservation regulations that are inflexible and insensitive to costs, uncertainty, and competing values. We instead advocate for experimentation, flexibility, and pragmatism. Third, we suggest that precautionary approaches to conservation regulation are out of step with a rapidly changing world facing uncertain shocks and disruptions. Finally, based on a systematic review of ecosystem change following disturbance, we find simplistic models of ecosystem resilience to be poorly supported by data. Ecosystem change is more the rule than the exception, and while academic ecologists have noted this to be the case, the ramifications of this pattern have yet to be embraced by resource managers. Our goal is to challenge conservationists to question popular conceptual models relentlessly and embrace new information, even when it challenges deeply held assumptions.

AB  - The classification of plant species as native or exotic has ramifications for how they are treated within urban green space policy and practice. Green spaces are built or managed to fulfil a range of ecological and social functions, and decisions must be made about which plants to include to achieve these functions. There is growing literary and policy emphasis on native-only planting strategies, under the assumption that native species will deliver a greater range of biodiversity benefits. Yet, there remains a disconnection between theoretical debates on the definition or value of nativeness, and urban design practice.
   Using a systematic review, we examine the relationship between plant nativeness and animal biodiversity in urban areas. We argue that both the use and definition of native species involve value-laden decisions. The social roots of 'native' definitions have led to ambiguity in its use within the literature. Despite this ambiguity, we find that most studies show a positive influence of native plants on at least one measure of biodiversity, justifying their priority in urban plantings to support native animals. We conclude with considerations for the selection of plants for urban greening to promote native biodiversity: 1) the resources a plant provides are more important than its origin, but 2) when in doubt, 'nativeness' is a good surrogate of whether a plant will provide for local animals, and allows for the conservation of plants themselves; and 3) flexibility in scale of provenance allows for strategic responses to changing climates or competing objectives of urban design.

AB  - BackgroundWomen with advanced uterine cervical cancer suffer from a combination of moderate to severe physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress due to their disease and are in need of palliative care to improve their quality of life. Approximately 85% of the women live in the low- and middle-income countries. Whether these women and their families access palliative care is not known.ObjectivesTo understand the geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability of palliative care by patients with advanced cervical cancer and their families.MethodsWe conducted a Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines in CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed and Scopus for the core concepts: palliative care, access, advanced uterine cervical cancer. Eligible articles were published in English, contained original data on experiences of patients and/or caregivers including symptoms management, and discussed available resources, communication, satisfaction, and healthcare utilization.ResultsOverall there was limited access to palliative care with the few available facilities located in cities, far from the rural areas where most women lived. Pervasive poverty was common with poor affordability of healthcare, travelling, accommodation, and subsistence expenses. Misconceptions and poor knowledge of the disease, cultural beliefs and attitudes, and other health system insufficiencies also presented challenges for access.ConclusionConcerted effort should be made to improve availability of palliative care facilities. Health education to address misconceptions and other cognitive barriers that limit access among cervical cancer patients and their families should be urgently undertaken in the LMICs.

AB  - In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) followed by studies of global scale (11%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10%). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37%) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19%), and climate change predictions (17%). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94%) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to collect evidence on the issues and challenges in cryptocurrency estate planning and the possible approaches or methods to address them. Then, this paper also aims to understand Malaysia's situation compared to global situations and determine how the country could address those challenges.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study adapted a standard systematic review protocol named preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, guided by three research questions: what are the challenges of cryptocurrency estate planning, how do researchers and practitioners address the issues or challenges and how could Malaysians move towards sustainable cryptocurrency estate planning? Relevant documents reported on cryptocurrency estate planning were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Findings - The results of this review suggested that the issues and challenges in cryptocurrency estate planning can be described from six aspects: awareness, financial aspects, law, process, security and taxation. On the other hand, the approaches ormethods to address these challenges may be categorised into laws, processes and technology. Further, a framework for cryptocurrency estate planning in Malaysia is proposed as an initial step towards a sustainable economy and society in Malaysia.
   Research limitations/implications - The state and the use of cryptocurrency are still considered new in most countries globally. Hence, people are yet to be aware of the issues that may arise from it. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency estate planning will soon become an area of interest in which this study could enhance the literature and contribute knowledge to understanding the situation.
   Originality/value - This study collected evidence on the issues and the approaches to address cryptocurrency estate planning. This study then focused on the Malaysian perspective by proposing a framework that was not covered by existing studies.

AB  - Background Health-care professionals worldwide have started to appreciate patients' perspectives on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) particularly given its popularity. However, cultural perspectives may vary and it may not be possible to apply research findings on the use of CAM from the west to the east.
   Objective This systematic review aims to synthesize usage patterns of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) amongst Chinese populations in different parts of the world and explore potential geographical variations.
   Search strategy Six international and four Chinese databases were searched, and manual searches of relevant monographs and government publications were carried out.
   Inclusion criteria Quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method research that aimed to investigate Chinese patients' perception of, and perspectives on, TCM was included.
   Data extraction and synthesis For each study included, texts under the headings of 'results' or 'findings' were extracted and subjected to analysis. A thematic synthesis approach was adopted for synthesizing qualitative and quantitative studies.
   Main results Amongst the 28 studies included, twenty were quantitative surveys, six were qualitative studies and two were mixed-method studies. The overall methodological quality was mediocre. Data synthesis suggested that patients from all regions share a common cultural affinity to TCM and consider it to be an effective complement to western medicine (WM) for treating chronic or serious diseases. However, heterogeneous views on (i) disclosing TCM use to WM doctors and (ii) the potential harm of herbs emerged across different study locations.
   Discussion and conclusions Future research should explore how variation in health systems may influence patients' perception of CAM in different countries.

AB  - The growth of the world merchant fleet in recent decades has caused an increase in congestion and complexity in maritime traffic, especially in coastal areas, straits and nearby channels.
   This fact, which acts negatively upon maritime safety, however, has meant a decrease in the number of accidents, rather, they have even been reduced by half in the last decade.
   This anomaly is explained by the implementation of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in these conflict areas and for this reason, in this review we will study, through the analysis of different relevant studies on the subject, the relationship between the human element and maritime safety, focusing on the figure of the vessel traffic service operator (VTSO) as a link between safety and efficiency, exploring their staffing, training, functions and factors affecting them within the maritime system.
   This review was conducted following the reporting guidelines for systematic reviews based on the PRISMA 2020 model (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analyses).
   Also, a bibliometric analysis of the extensive academic literature pertaining to maritime safety in relation to the human factor was carried out, focusing especially on VTS and the operators that act in them, with a special focus on the period from 2000 to 2020. Based on 371 articles, the bibliometric analyses yield to us the information on the publication patterns related to the year of publication and the keywords by identifying the main thematic groups, finally extracting 11 representative articles that have been investigated in detail focusing on the influence of the human factor in maritime safety in the VTS environment.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that corporate sustainability is paradoxical in nature, as corporates and managers have to achieve economic, social, and environmental goals, simultaneously. While a paradox perspective has been broadly incorporated into sustainability research for more than a decade, it has resulted in limited improvement in our understanding of corporate sustainability paradox management. In this study, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability paradox management by adopting the Smith-Lewis three-stage model of dynamic equilibrium. The results reveal the following: (1) Both environmental and cognitive factors manifest tensions arising from the sustainability paradox. (2) While both proactive and defensive strategies are adopted to manage the tensions embedded in the corporate sustainability, the proactive strategy is more extensively studied in the current literature. (3) Management strategies of corporate sustainability paradox are characterized as multi-level, multi-stage, and dealing with multiple paradoxes. (4) Proactive strategies enable organizations to enjoy short-term and long-term sustainability benefits. The authors call for further research explicitly addressing the following areas: (1) the paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability management; (2) corporate sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations; (3) the micro-foundations of corporate sustainability paradox management; (4) defensive strategies and new proactive strategies; and (5) a unified standard of sustainability outcomes. The practical implications of this review are then elaborated. In practice, the results imply that organizations would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. This review and proposed research agenda are expected to deepen interdisciplinary knowledge and set the stage for interested scholars to undertake in their future inquiries.

AB  - Agro-food sustainability transitions refer to fundamental changes necessary to move towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. The young field of research on sustainability transitions in agro-food systems is still largely ill-defined. In order to delineate its contours, this paper provides a critical review of the main research themes and highlights research gaps. A search carried out on Scopus in January 2018 yielded 549 records and 111 research articles were included in the systematic review. Research gaps were identified through an analysis of the alignment of the research field with the research agenda of the Sustainability Transitions Research Network (STRN) and its research themes i.e. implementation strategies for managing transitions; power and politics; civil society, social movements and culture in transitions; role of industries and firms in transitions; transitions in everyday life and practice (sustainable consumption); geography of transitions; and modelling transitions. The strand of research on agro-food sustainability transitions is multifaceted and diverse; it addresses all the themes of the STRN's research agenda. However, it focuses on transition management and sustainable consumption, while it largely underserves the themes dealing with the role of civil society and firms in transitions as well as the geography of transitions. Therefore, research on agro-food sustainability transitions should fill research gaps relating to agency (cf. role of social movements and civil society, firms and industries, etc.) and spatiality/geography in transitions. The paper suggests that these two research topics should be addressed in an articulated research agenda that accommodates the peculiarities of sustainability transitions processes in the agro-food system.

AB  - The digital transformation of manufacturing (a phenomenon also known as Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing) is finding a growing interest both at practitioner and academic levels, but is still in its infancy and needs deeper investigation. Even though current and potential advantages of digital manufacturing are remarkable, in terms of improved efficiency, sustainability, customization, and flexibility, only a limited number of companies has already developed ad hoc strategies necessary to achieve a superior performance. Through a systematic review, this study aims at assessing the current state of the art of the academic literature regarding the paradigm shift occurring in the manufacturing settings, in order to provide definitions as well as point out recurring patterns and gaps to be addressed by future research. For the literature search, the most representative keywords, strict criteria, and classification schemes based on authoritative reference studies were used. The final sample of 156 primary publications was analyzed through a systematic coding process to identify theoretical and methodological approaches, together with other significant elements. This analysis allowed a mapping of the literature based on clusters of critical themes to synthesize the developments of different research streams and provide the most representative picture of its current state. Research areas, insights, and gaps resulting from this analysis contributed to create a schematic research agenda, which clearly indicates the space for future evolutions of the state of knowledge in this field.

AB  - Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) prevalence in priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among men aged 20 years, has not yet reached the goal of 80% coverage recommended by the World Health Organization. Determining novel strategies to increase VMMC uptake among men 20 years is critical to reach HIV epidemic control. We conducted a systematic review to analyze the effectiveness of economic compensation and incentives to increase VMMC uptake among older men in order to inform VMMC demand creation programs. The review included five qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies published in peer reviewed journals. Data was extracted into a study summary table, and tables synthesizing study characteristics and results. Results indicate that cash reimbursements for transportation and food vouchers of small nominal amounts to partially compensate for wage loss were effective, while enrollment into lotteries offering prizes were not. Economic compensation provided a final push toward VMMC uptake for men who had already been considering undergoing circumcision. This was in settings with high circumcision prevalence brought by various VMMC demand creation strategies. Lottery prizes offered in the studies did not appear to help overcome barriers to access VMMC and qualitative evidence suggests this may partially explain why they were not effective. Economic compensation may help to increase VMMC uptake in priority countries with high circumcision prevalence when it addresses barriers to uptake. Ethical considerations, sustainability, and possible externalities should be carefully analyzed in countries considering economic compensation as an additional strategy to increase VMMC uptake.

AB  - Objective: Common psychosocial difficulties experienced by cancer patients are fatigue, depression, anxiety, and existential and relational concerns. Art therapy is one intervention being developed to address these difficulties. The purpose of this research was to assess and synthesize the available research evidence for the use of art therapy in the management of symptoms in adults with cancer.
   Methods: A literature search of electronic databases, 'grey' literature, hand searching of key journals, and personal contacts was undertaken. Keywords searched were 'art therapy' and 'cancer' or 'neoplasm'. The inclusion criteria were: research studies of any design; adult cancer population; and art therapy intervention. There were no language or date restrictions. Data extraction occurred and quality appraisal was undertaken. Data were analyzed using narrative synthesis.
   Results: Fourteen papers reporting 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Symptoms investigated spanned emotional, physical, social and global functioning, and existential/spiritual concerns. Measures used were questionnaires, in-depth interviews, patients' artwork, therapists' narratives of sessions, and stress markers in salivary samples. No overall effect size was determined owing to heterogeneity of studies. Narrative synthesis of the studies shows art therapy is used at all stages of the cancer trajectory, most frequently by women, the most common cancer site in participants being breast.
   Conclusion: Art therapy is a psychotherapeutic approach that is being used by adults with cancer to manage a spectrum of treatment-related symptoms and facilitate the process of psychological readjustment to the loss, change, and uncertainty characteristic of cancer survivorship. Research in this area is still in its infancy. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The construction industry is criticized for causing adverse impacts on the environment. To minimize these impacts, the industry has been seeking to introduce sustainable practices throughout its entire production chain. Therefore, the objective of this study is to run a quantitative bibliometric research through meta-analysis methodology and, consequently, to evaluate the articles used by qualitative methods in the area of sustainability in civil construction. For this, a search was carried out on the Web of Science. Thus, a set of keywords was used, followed by a filtering method, resulting in a review of 433 articles published in 18 years. VOSviewer software was used in the quantitative analysis of documents. The results demonstrated a lack of quantitative methodologies to assess sustainability in the civil construction industry. Thus, this research presents the evolution of studies, the main areas addressed, the main certifications and methodologies for environmental assessment, and the distribution of the on-site work stages in articles. This revealed the main contributions found in the literature, presenting the article's focus, being as main areas explored material, project management, sustainability assessment, and energy; the most used methodology (LCA) and environmental certification (LEED). It was seen that the social and economic pillars are less frequently tackled when compared to the environmental one. It was also perceived that most of the papers focus on the planning and execution stages of the on-site work, being necessary to develop more studies on operation and maintenance stages. These results serve as a source of reference for future research.

AB  - With the diminishing extents of Arctic sea ice, Arctic shipping becomes increasingly attractive for the shipping industry. Voyages along Arctic sea routes have seen a significant increase in recent years. Given the harsh environment, shipping operations in the Arctic constitute a hazardous activity for people onboard vessels, while vessels pose risks to vulnerable ecosystems and traditional socio-cultural environments. Given this emerging trend, this paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the broad academic literature related to risk management of Arctic shipping, published in the period from 2000 to 2019. Based on 221 articles, the bibliometric analyses provide insights in publication patterns concerning the year of publication, keywords, journals, and countries/regions from which the work originates. Furthermore, through a qualitative systematic review, this article presents a synthesis of risk influencing factors (RIFs) of navigational accidents in the Arctic, based on published quantitative risk models containing accident scenarios in Arctic shipping. To this effect, ten papers are investigated in detail, focusing on the scenario, methods, data sources, and RIFs. Identifying major thematic clusters in the RIFs, a model is proposed for synthesizing and illustrating the relationships among environmental and shiprelated RIFs, and accident scenarios in Arctic shipping. A discussion is made concerning challenges in the research domain and future research directions, focusing on the strength of evidence in the risk models, the use of linear versus complex, systemic accident theories, and on the alignment of academic work with focus issues in regulatory contexts.

AB  - Offsetting aims to compensate for negative impacts due to authorized anthropogenic impacts associated with development. While anchored into legislation, residual or chronic impacts can occur after offset establishment. Advice and best practice on how to approach these impacts is rare. To address this, we reviewed 30 projects based on a systematic review and meta-analysis in freshwater ecosystems dealing with residual or long-term negative impacts to provide application advice for: habitat creation, habitat restoration, and biological and chemical manipulation. Project information was obtained through Boolean search terms and web-scraping. Habitat creation projects had a pooled effect size of 0.8 and offsetting ratios of 1:5 with high biomass increases of >140% compared to pre-establishment, associated with them. Habitat restoration projects targeted a wide range of species and communities with a pooled effect size of 0.66, offset ratios ranging from 1:1.2 to 1:4.6, and biomass increases generally > 100% compared to pre-restoration. Biological manipulation had the lowest effect size (0.51) with stocking being highly variable both in terms of biomass benefits and project outcomes pointing towards being mostly applicable in cases of direct fish harm not related to habitat aspects. We conclude that (1) all three assessed approaches have a potential application use for offsetting residual or chronic harm with approach-specific caveats. (2) Implementation costs differ across offset methods, with connectivity and side-channel projects having the lowest biomass gain per area costs (3) Time to first benefits required one to two years with time lags needing to be accounted for in the implementation and monitoring process.

AB  - Human has been evolving in a natural environment over a long time; thus, he is habitual to adapt it. Green spaces are obligatory landscapes in an urban structure that provide a natural environment and accelerate other life events. In contrast, unplanned urbanization, and conversion from green to grey structures have damaged natural environmental resources. Studies through different angles have highlighted the importance of urban green spaces for human well-being but now need to identify their role according to the potential. The demands of urban green spaces may differ with the change of population size, types of grey structure, urban expansion, the altitude of the place, and geographical location. Therefore, this systematic review aims to analyse the significance of urban green spaces for human well-being. The study opted for a systematic process during the selection and organization of studies for this review. After analysing, 46 studies were finalized with the consensus of three review authors. Accordingly, literature was analysed under the central theme of "Urban Green Spaces for Human Well-being." Human Well-being was assessed under six sub-themes; physical, psychological, mental, social, subjective, and environmental well-being. The review concluded that urban green spaces are the primary pillar for a sustainable urban place and human well-being due to highly positive and positive correlations. Moreover, the study did not find any demarcation line between green spaces and grey structures according to any specific need. Therefore, the study suggested that the role of urban green spaces for human well-being should be analysed according to their potential and required optimal ratio under different communities' urban specific environments and social behaviour.

AB  - The present study synthesizes existing literature on Forest Ecosystem Vulnerability (FEV) assessments across the world's mountain regions. The synthesis reveals a globally substantial number of studies are available on FEV assessment. However, such studies are limited in the mountain regions. Of the total 75 peer-reviewed research papers considered for synthesis, there are 61 (81.32%) studies specific to the country, 6 (8%) to continental, 4 (5.34%) to global scales, and the remaining 4 (5.34%) to local. The study results reveal that most assessments are model-based projections, where complex topography of mountains creates uncertainty for climate projections in limited analyses of socio-ecological indicators. Only a few studies (12%) have considered socio-ecological and ground-based data, which are primarily required for adaptation and management planning at the local level. Overall synthesis of literature provided vital information on climate change impacts and suggested management and adaptation plans but was far from a broad reality for the future of the mountain ecosystem under the paradox of climate change. Scales, targets, indicators, and assessment approaches varied widely and focused on only a subset of resources. We recommend forest managers should critically examine the scale, indicators, methods, and targets when planning forest vulnerability assessments. This synthesis of FEV assessment will help suggest the best approaches and indicators given the limited number of model studies in the mountain area for decision and policy making for forest resource management.

AB  - Research in the field of sustainable development (SD) in many developing countries remains multifaceted and discipline-oriented, especially at the institutional level where researchers and practitioners regularly produce research outputs to inform policy decisions aimed at meeting the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although a number of seminal research studies have focused on incorporating aspects of SD in higher education institutions through curriculum development and partnerships, there are still challenges with regard to the uptake of SD practices by universities in Ghana, West Africa - the focus of the study presented in this article - as well as in many other developing countries. For his study, the author undertook a systematic review of the literature on sustainability research in the context of Ghana, particularly in relation to higher education. His literature review revealed that a lack of understanding of education for sustainable development (ESD) by many individuals and institutions is creating a gap in knowledge and practice within the higher education landscape. To address this problem, the author proposes the adoption of an "ecosystem" that integrates (1) research networks; (2) national SD activities; (3) institutional structures and leadership; and (4) the ESD concept of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs into the curricula of Ghanaian universities. The author suggests that such an ecosystem could encourage a collegial environment that supports the exchange of SD ideas and skills among staff and students. In addition, the SD ecosystem could provide a framework for developing students' knowledge and skills in line with global SD agendas, while also heightening research networks both locally and internationally, and ensuring that universities adopt research-informed SD practices.

AB  - Background Medical tourism has grown increasingly popular in the past few decades. Cosmetic surgery centers have developed in vacation locales, offering procedures at lower prices. However, surgeons and patients alike are often unprepared for management of complications after patients return to the USA. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of US cosmetic surgery tourism patients and the complications faced by US healthcare providers.
   Methods A systematic review was performed using the Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases up to February 2022; included articles were full-text, English language, and reported complications of patients receiving postoperative care in the USA after cosmetic surgery abroad. Two independent reviewers performed screening for article eligibility with a 3rd for conflict resolution. Patient demographics, procedure characteristics, and outcomes were extracted and aggregated.
   Results Twenty studies were included, describing 214 patients. Most patients were female (98.1%, n = 210), middle-aged, and Hispanic. The most common destination country was the Dominican Republic (82.7%, n = 177) and the most common surgical procedure was abdominoplasty (35.7%, n = 114). Complications were mainly infectious (50.9%, n = 112) and required prolonged treatment periods often greater than two months, with high rates of hospitalization (36.8%) and surgical management (51.8%).
   Conclusions Cosmetic surgery tourism is a growing industry with adverse implications for the US healthcare system and patients themselves. This review aims to serve as a reference to prepare plastic surgeons for the scope of complications associated with cosmetic tourism and improve counseling to better prepare patients for the financial and health risks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to describe the experiences of parents who have children with chronic kidney disease.
   METHODS. We conducted a systematic review and meta-ethnography of studies that had used in-depth interviews or focus groups to explore experiences of parents with children who have chronic kidney disease (predialysis, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or after kidney transplantation). We searched 5 electronic databases (through to August 2005), Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Sociofile/Sociological Abstract, and reference lists of relevant articles.
   RESULTS. Sixteen articles that reported the experiences of parents of 358 children with chronic kidney disease were included. Ten themes emerged, which we grouped into 3 interrelated clusters: intrapersonal (living with constant uncertainty, stress, and maintaining vigilance despite experiencing fatigue), interpersonal (medicalization of the parental role, dependence on and conflict with staff, and disrupted peer relationships), and external issues (management of the medical regimen, pursuit of information, organizing transportation, accommodation and finances, adhering to the child's liquid and diet restrictions, and balancing medical care with domestic responsibilities).
   CONCLUSIONS. In addition to "normal" parental roles, being a parent of a child with chronic kidney disease demands a high-level health care provider, problem solving, information seeking, and financial and practical skills at a time when the capacity to cope is threatened by physical tiredness, uncertainty, and disruption to peer support within and outside the family structure. Parents of children with chronic kidney disease need multidisciplinary care, which may lead to improved outcomes for their children.

AB  - Expanding involvement of the public in citizen science projects can benefit both volunteers and professional scientists alike. Recently, citizen science has come into focus as an important data source for reporting and monitoring United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since bees play an essential role in the pollination ecosystem service, citizen science projects involving them have a high potential for attaining SDGs. By performing a systematic review of citizen science studies on bees, we assessed how these studies could contribute towards SDG reporting and monitoring, and also verified compliance with citizen science principles. Eighty eight studies published from 1992 to 2020 were collected. SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 17 (Partnerships) were the most outstanding, potentially contributing to targets related to biodiversity protection, restoration and sustainable use, capacity building and establishing multi stakeholder partnerships. SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) were also addressed. Studies were found to produce new knowledge, apply methods to improve data quality, and invest in open access publishing. Notably, volunteer participation was mainly restricted to data collection. Further challenges include extending these initiatives to developing countries, where only a few citizen science projects are underway.

AB  - Tourism industry is one of the leading sectors in economic development as create business opportunities, such as hospitality; food; handicraft; etc. However, gender stereotypes are still inherent in running a business so men dominate business ownership even though many women start a business. The low level of female entrepreneurship, based on several studies, identified by culture which limits their movement. It is because women are identical with housework. Given the lack of discussion on this issue, we'll evaluate what has been studied theoretically and gained deep insight through literature review. A systematic review of the culture on female's decision making for entrepreneurship will be undertaken in this study.

AB  - Digital technologies offer opportunities and challenges for corporate environmental management (CEM). In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on the relationship between digital transformation (DT) and CEM using a systematic review approach in the Antecedents, Decisions, and Outcomes (ADO) format. We review 181 papers published in almost 30 years from 1997 to 2022 and identify studies and areas where DT has impacted on CEM. We find that the literature examining the DT-CEM relationship has surged since 2019 and is concentrated in areas such as green sustainable science technology and environmental sciences. Further, we analyze the economic consequences of DT, the drivers of CEM, and the mechanisms of DT on CEM. Based on the literature analysis, we find that there is still a large gap in the literature studying the mediators and moderators of the DT-CEM relationship. Further, we find that firms with DT have better responsiveness and improved CEM by using digital resources to accurately capture the demands of different stakeholders on the environment. Finally, we provide a research framework and possible research directions, and propose corresponding management insights and policy recommendations.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that have estimated the relationship between the number of accidents involving motor vehicles and cyclists or pedestrians and the volume of motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. A key objective of most of these studies has been to determine if there is a safety-in-numbers effect. There is safety-in-numbers if the number of accidents increases less than proportionally to traffic volume (for motor vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists). All studies reviewed in the paper are multivariate accident prediction models, estimating regression coefficients that show how the number of accidents depends on the conflicting flows (pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicles), as well as (in some of the models) other factors that influence the number of accidents. Meta-analysis of regression coefficients involves methodological problems, which require careful consideration of whether the coefficients are sufficiently comparable to be formally synthesised by means of standard techniques of meta-analysis. The comparability of regression coefficients was assessed. It was concluded that a formal synthesis of regression coefficients in studies of the safety-in-numbers effect is defensible. According to a random-effects inverse-variance meta-analysis, the summary estimates of the regression coefficients for traffic volume are 0.50 for motor vehicle volume, 0.43 for cycle volume and 0.51 for pedestrianyolume. Estimates are highly consistent between studies. It is concluded that a safety-in-numbers effect exists. It is still not clear whether this effect is causal, nor, if causal, which mechanisms generate the effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aquatic foods are an essential part of food systems providing an accessible source of nutrition for millions of people. Yet, it is unclear to what degree research across diverse disciplines concerning aquatic foods has engaged food systems, and the value this concept has added. We conducted a systematic review of fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic food literature (2017-2019) to determine the following: the characteristics of this research; the food systems components and interrelations with which research engaged; and the insights generated on nutrition, justice, sustainability and climate change. Sixty five of the 88 reviewed articles focussed on production and supply chains, with 23 considering human nutrition. Only 13% of studies examined low- and middle-income countries that are most vulnerable to undernutrition. One third of articles looked beyond finfish to other aquatic foods, which illuminated values of local knowledge systems and diverse foods for nutrition. When aggregated, reviewed articles examined the full range of food system drivers-biophysical and environmental (34%), demographic (24%) and socio-cultural (27%)-but rarely examined interactions between drivers. Future research that examines a diversity of species in diets, system-wide flows of nutrients, trade-offs amongst objectives, and the nutritional needs of vulnerable social groups would be nudging closer to the ambitions of the food systems concept, which is necessary to address the global challenges of equity, nutrition and sustainability.

AB  - China's 2018 waste import ban caused Thailand to receive excess waste without proper waste management, causing pollution, overflowing landfills, and exploitation of waste pickers. Using mobile platforms to transform Thailand's recycling industry can improve waste pickers' income and well-being, reduce middlemen and transportation costs, and increase government tax revenue. This can contribute to achieving SDGs 1, 8, and 12, reducing poverty, promoting economic growth and decent work, and promoting sustainable consumption and production.

AB  - Global warming and the obesity epidemic are two unprecedented challenges mankind faces today. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and Scopus for articles published until July 2017 that reported findings on the relationship between global warming and the obesity epidemic. Fifty studies were identified. Topic-wise, articles were classified into four relationships - global warming and the obesity epidemic are correlated because of common drivers (n = 21); global warming influences the obesity epidemic (n = 13); the obesity epidemic influences global warming (n = 13); and global warming and the obesity epidemic influence each other (n = 3). We constructed a conceptual model linking global warming and the obesity epidemic - the fossil fuel economy, population growth and industrialization impact land use and urbanization, motorized transportation and agricultural productivity and consequently influences global warming by excess greenhouse gas emission and the obesity epidemic by nutrition transition and physical inactivity; global warming also directly impacts obesity by food supply/price shock and adaptive thermogenesis, and the obesity epidemic impacts global warming by the elevated energy consumption. Policies that endorse deployment of clean and sustainable energy sources, and urban designs that promote active lifestyles, are likely to alleviate the societal burden of global warming and obesity.

AB  - Quantifying and mapping resilience and social vulnerability is a widely used technique to support risk management, with recent years seeing a proliferation of applications across the Global South. To synthesise this emerging literature, we conducted a systematic review of applications of social vulnerability and resilience frameworks in Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) using the PRISMA methodology. 2152 papers were extracted from 15 databases and then screened according to our pre-defined criteria, leaving 68 studies for full text analysis. Our analysis revealed that: (1) Most studies consider vulnerability or resilience to be generic properties of social systems; (2) Few papers measured vulnerability or resilience in a way that tests whether they are relatively stable or dynamic features of social systems; (3) Many applications rely on stock applications of existing frameworks, with little adaptation to specific cultural, societal or economic contexts; (4) There is a lack of systematic validation; (5) More hypothesis driven studies (as opposed to descriptive mapping exercises) are required in order to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms through which vulnerability and resilience shape the capacity to prepare for, respond and recover from disasters.

AB  - Inappropriate behavior on school buses is a safety issue that concerns students, parents, and educators. There is potential for traffic-related injury, and the limited adult supervision on school buses often facilitates bullying and other infractions. This review identified peer-reviewed articles and dissertations evaluating behavioral interventions designed to improve student behaviors on school buses. Identified studies (n = 18) provided limited information regarding the characteristics of participants and generally assessed the effect of driver-or researcher-implemented reinforcement, punishment, and other management activities on the behavior of all passengers. Studies yielded modest results and did not satisfy the most recent quality indicators of the Council of Exceptional Children. Nonetheless, findings have implications for the implementation of driver-oriented management strategies as well as research concerning new approaches to behavior management aboard school buses.

AB  - Mountains play a key role in the provision of nature's contributions to people (NCP) worldwide that support societies' quality of life. Simultaneously, mountains are threatened by multiple drivers of change. Due to the complex interlinkages between biodiversity, quality of life and drivers of change, research on NCP in mountains requires interdisciplinary approaches. In this study, we used the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the notion of NCP to determine to what extent previous research on ecosystem services in mountains has explored the different components of the IPBES conceptual framework. We conducted a systematic review of articles on ecosystem services in mountains published up to 2016 using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Descriptive statistical and network analyses were conducted to explore the level of research on the components of the IPBES framework and their interactions. Our results show that research has gradually become more interdisciplinary by studying higher number of NCP, dimensions of quality of life, and indirect drivers of change. Yet, research focusing on biodiversity, regulating NCP and direct drivers has decreased over time. Furthermore, despite the fact that research on NCP in mountains becoming more policy-oriented over time, mainly in relation to payments for ecosystem services, institutional responses remained underexplored in the reviewed studies. Finally, we discuss the relevant knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research in order to contribute to IPBES.

AB  - It is important to protect forest and grassland ecosystems because they are ecologically rich and provide numerous ecosystem services. Upscaling monitoring from local to global scale is imperative in reaching this goal. The SDG Agenda does not include indicators that directly quantify ecosystem health. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can bridge the gap for large-scale ecosystem health assessment. We systematically reviewed field-based and remote-based measures of ecosystem health for forests and grasslands, identified the most important ones and provided an overview on remote sensing and GIS-based measures. We included 163 English language studies within terrestrial non-tropical biomes and used a pre-defined classification system to extract ecological stressors and attributes, collected corresponding indicators, measures, and proxy values. We found that the main ecological attributes of each ecosystem contribute differently in the literature, and that almost half of the examined studies used remote sensing to estimate indicators. The major stressor for forests was "climate change", followed by "insect infestation"; for grasslands it was "grazing", followed by "climate change". "Biotic interactions, composition, and structure" was the most important ecological attribute for both ecosystems. "Fire disturbance" was the second most important for forests, while for grasslands it was "soil chemistry and structure". Less than a fifth of studies used vegetation indices; NDVI was the most common. There are monitoring inconsistencies from the broad range of indicators and measures. Therefore, we recommend a standardized field, GIS, and remote sensing-based approach to monitor ecosystem health and integrity and facilitate land managers and policy-makers.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach offers a more ecologically relevant method to establish environmental conservation goals and implement ecological risk assessment (ERA). The emergence of bibliometrics has facilitated the development of new systematic review techniques. In this study, we utilised CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and SciMAT software, based on the Web of Science database, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the ecosystem service-based ecological risk assessment (ESRA) literature knowledge map spanning from 1994 to 2023. This article explored the field's evolution from macro to micro perspectives, incorporating background information, current trends, and knowledge structure. The findings demonstrate that ESRA has progressed from an initial stage to a phase of global cooperation and policy applications. This transition between stages has been characterised by a shift from focusing on natural processes to understanding human impacts on ecosystems. Key themes identified include ecosystem services, landscape ERA, aquatic ERA and ecosystem health. The overall development of ERA can be observed as a progression through different periods, namely, the traditional era, regional era, and landscape era. Currently, landscape ERA methods based on changes in land use and land cover are widely employed. The study also revealed various challenges in the ESRA field, such as data availability, scale issues, and uncertainty. Future ESRA studies should consider holistic ecosystem services, interdisciplinary approaches, ecological models, and advanced technologies to address complexity. Using big data and informatisation for research offers new opportunities but requires integration and innovation. It is anticipated that ESRA holds promise for ecological sustainability and human wellbeing.

AB  - Background: Governments and health care providers are keen to find innovative ways to deliver care more efficiently. Interest in electronic consultation (e-consultation) has grown, but the evidence of benefit is uncertain.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the evidence of delivering e-consultation using secure email and messaging or video links in primary care.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the use and application of e-consultations in primary care. We searched 7 international databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EconLit, and Web of Science; 1999-2017), identifying 52 relevant studies. Papers were screened against a detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Independent dual data extraction was conducted and assessed for quality. The resulting evidence was synthesized using thematic analysis.
   Results: This review included 57 studies from a range of countries, mainly the United States (n=30) and the United Kingdom (n=13). There were disparities in uptake and utilization toward more use by younger, employed adults. Patient responses to e-consultation were mixed. Patients reported satisfaction with services and improved self-care, communication, and engagement with clinicians. Evidence for the acceptability and ease of use was strong, especially for those with long-term conditions and patients located in remote regions. However, patients were concerned about the privacy and security of their data. For primary health care staff, e-consultation delivers challenges around time management, having the correct technological infrastructure, whether it offers a comparable standard of clinical quality, and whether it improves health outcomes.
   Conclusions: E-consultations may improve aspects of care delivery, but the small scale of many of the studies and low adoption rates leave unanswered questions about usage, quality, cost, and sustainability. We need to improve e-consultation implementation, demonstrate how e-consultations will not increase disparities in access, provide better reassurance to patients about privacy, and incorporate e-consultation as part of a manageable clinical workflow.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are globally threatened, yet remain poorly studied. In the Caribbean, the most biodiverse of island biodiversity hotspots, TDFs have structural properties distinct from the Neotropical mainland and are important to local communities for ecosystem services. We undertook a systematic review (n = 186) of ecosystem services literature of Caribbean TDF. Only 19.89% qualified for inclusion, with the majority (56.76%) from primary literature. Research on supporting services (31.14%), particularly primary production was predominant. Most studies (70.97%) took a biophysical perspective and quantification focused on the supply of ecosystem services (43.00%), while measurement of wellbeing benefits were uncommon. Geographic coverage of all studies was patchy originating from only nine of 28 independent countries and dependent territories. Our findings highlight a lack of research, while accentuating the value of grey literature in quantifying cultural services. Of concern, are gaps in air- and water-related services and the importance of TDF to human health. To move from biophysical assessments to a broader portfolio of ecosystem services studies, research on Caribbean TDF should be collaborative and strategic. Such gaps and research biases suggest opportunities for evidence-led policy-making. These lessons are relevant for mainstreaming ecosystem services into decision-making in Small Island Developing States.

AB  - The societal reliance on motorised transport is negatively affecting the health of humans and the environment. Active travel provides a unique solution to both issues by removing the number of motorised vehicles on the road, while also increasing physical activity rates. Interventions that encourage greater uptake of active travel are considered to be highly beneficial to society. This systematic review of the literature sought to provide evidence to answer the question which behavioural interventions increase commuter cycling? Five databases were searched to identify articles that tested a behavioural intervention to increase commuter cycling. Article parameters were defined from the literature and in consultation with the research team. Study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction were undertaken using Covidence. The final 25 articles revealed that personalised travel plans and mobile phone-based platforms were the most common interventions. Unvalidated travel surveys were the most widely used mode of data collection. Modest increases in commuter cycling were observed across studies; however, the heterogeneity of study designs and reporting of results did not allow aggregation of findings. This review highlights the need for high quality behavioural science research into active travel. This will assist us to better understand the most effective interventions that increase levels of commuter cycling, subsequently improving environmental and human health.

KW  - BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions that utilize natural vegetation, soils, and microbes to treat domestic wastewater and industrial effluents. They are engineered treatment systems that mimic the functions of natural wetlands to capture stormwater, reduce nutrient loads, and create diverse wildlife habitats. Providing these monetary and non-monetary benefits, its implementation has grown in several applications and geographical spread. Recent studies integrate the ecosystem services of CWs in project valuation, and the critical analysis of research hotspots has not been made yet. This study employs a systematic review to analyze the literature on ecosystem services provided by CWs and how they are incorporated into the valuation of CW projects. Among the ecosystem services that have been identified are provisioning (biomass and water supply), regulating (wastewater treatment and purification, climate regulation, flood prevention, and erosion control), cultural (recreation and aesthetic, biodiversity, education, and research), and supporting (habitat formation, nutrient cycling, and hydrological cycle). In terms of valuation methods and techniques, the results identified contingent valuation, shadow pricing, cost-benefit analysis, benefits transfer, habitat evaluation procedures, replacement cost, and travel cost. The analysis results provide researchers with a concrete basis for future studies and directions for further development. This also provides policymakers and CW project planners with valuable insights on various aspects of policy support for CW adoption and project valuation.

AB  - Background:The third leading cause of death in infants under 1-month-old is neonatal sepsis. Following the severing of the umbilical cord, bacterial infection may result in newborn sepsis and mortality. The objective of this review on cultural patterns and umbilical cord-care outcomes is to evaluate present practices and create a case for developing and implementing novel cord-care regimens in Africa. Materials and methods:In order to find published studies on cultural patterns and outcomes of umbilical cord care among caregivers in Africa from January 2015 to December 2021, we conducted a systematic literature search across six computerized bibliographic databases: Google Scholar, POPLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus. As a result, a narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was employed to summarize the data from the included research. Results:There were 17 studies included in this review with 16 out of the 17 studies having a total of 5757 participants. The odds of neonatal sepsis were 13 times higher among infants whose caregivers had improper hygiene compared with those who had proper hygiene. The outcome of cord management showed that the majority (75.1%) of the umbilical cords were infected. Majority of the included studies (n=13) show that the respondents (caregivers) had a low level of knowledge and practice. Conclusion:This systematic review reveals that unsafe umbilical cord-care practices remained prevalent in some African regions. Home delivery is still a prevalent practice in some communities and inappropriate umbilical cord cleaning practices were common findings.

AB  - To date, wool is an underutilised sustainable resource that has the potential to reduce the use of plastic within the environment. Wool can be manufactured as rope, but is this a viable innovation? To gain a comprehensive understanding of the economic viability of utilising wool rope in seaweed aquaculture, a systematic literature review was undertaken. The review focuses on wool, rope, natural and man-made fibres and seaweed farming, and used bibliometric and content analysis of peer-reviewed papers, with no timeframe requirements. It is important to explore alternative materials to reduce marine rope pollution; ghost gear, microplastics from abrasion and plasticrusts are now believed to be significant ecological problems. To date, the production of wool rope is limited, and its strength and durability within the fishing industry remain untested. It is important to understand whether wool rope is a useful alternative: does it have the same tensile strength, and can it be used within the industry without the risk of damage to the environment? There is currently a lack of research on natural rope fibres, resulting in limited access to commercial rope alternatives being used within the industry. This systematic review shows that there has been a large gap in wool research, with limited publications in recent years; however, the drive to increase sustainability (particularly within the marine environment) has increased. This is the first paper that combines both topics within one research study. Further research is needed to identify whether wool rope will provide a feasible alternative to polypropylene in terms of strength and durability, and how wool rope will perform, the length of time it can provide optimum service and within which seaweed farming practice it can offer a practical alternative to polypropylene.

AB  - The compounding effects of climate change on food systems have led researchers into developing approaches aimed at understanding the multiple trade-offs and synergies associated to dealing with climate change. As countries continue to develop climate policies, in particular adaptation strategies, it is evident that these need to be articulated more effectively across multiple policy domains and jurisdictions. Climate policy integration is often sought to improve policy coherence and climate governance at different scales. The aim of this paper is to better understand to what degree climate policy integration is being achieved and what are the common barriers and enablers. Additional emphasis is placed on identifying challenges and opportunities specifically relevant to food systems and the attainment of food security goals. The study was conducted using the PRISMA Statement and four-phase diagram for reporting results of systematic reviews. The dataset analysed included 209 peerreview articles published in the period 2010-2020. The review shows that although climate policy integration is increasingly discussed as a preferred strategy to deal more effectively with complex and multiple policy domains, existing institutional and governance structures pose barriers to the effective integration of climate goals across sectors, approaches and jurisdictions. There are specific opportunities and challenges for food systems and food security. Among these opportunities are the conceptual compatibility which can be derived from land-use strategies that generate synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development goals. In addition, the agricultural sector has often developed vertical structures for the delivery of support services which can be utilized to facilitate vertical integration and implementation of strategies. In contrast, the legislative legacy and often complicated processes of policy layering, drift and conversion in land-use sectors challenge the achievement of policy coherence.

AB  - This article identifies current progressions and research gaps in Green Human Resource Management literature and investigates the future of green practices in meeting the social sustainability requirements of an organisation. Considering the growing awareness on greening and sustainability, a systematic review of the domain specific literature was carried out using the Scopus and Google Scholar databases which resulted in a set of 174 scientific articles between 1995 and 2019. NVivo Plus software version 12 was used for quantitative processing as well as qualitative analysis of data. Content coding and cluster analysis were performed, the results of which exhibited three clusters namely, green human resource management practices, employee green behaviour at workplace and organisational sustainability. Further manual analysis revealed social sustainability to be the least explored area than economic and environmental pillars of sustainability. From this, the authors conceptually explored a theoretical model suggesting the mediational role of 'employee green behaviour at workplace' in the relationship between 'green human resource management practices' and 'social sustainability' of organisations using grounded theory approach. Therefore, prioritising social equity, health, wellness and well-being, this work examines the state-of-the-art in green human resource management research to unravel the enormous potential of core green practices envisioning social sustainability, which has not been established till date. Based on the content coding, clustering, and further analysis, propositions, future paths and implications are also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Advanced practice nurses have made important contributions to the tasks of stabilising the opera-tion of the health system and improving the quality of care. However, taking on the role of an advanced practice nurse is always challenging and can even result in the intention to leave the profession. Insights into advanced practice nursing role transitions are important to implement effective interventions to help nurses cope with the corresponding turbulence and changes.Aim: To explore the experiences of advanced practice nurses during their role transition from registered nurses to their current role. Design: A systematic review of qualitative studies. Data sources: Five databases were searched from inception to August 2022: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase and CINAHL.Review methods: This review was reported in accordance with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Syn-thesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) guidelines. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, and quality appraisal was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal instru-ment for qualitative research. Data synthesis was conducted using thematic analysis.Findings: A total of 14 studies were included in this review. Three analytical themes emerged: (1) trudging along a narrow road, (2) driving and restraining forces in the transition, and (3) embracing the new identity. Four sub-themes were graded as high confidence and the other four were moderate confidence. Establishing a new role was a priority and a significant challenge for advanced practice nurses. Beliefs regarding advanced practice, the attitudes of colleagues, and the support of mentors impacted the transition process. Advanced practice nurses expressed appreciation for their new role and developed new ambitions at the end of the transition.Conclusions: Advanced practice nurses face a series of challenges during the process of role development, espe-cially struggles with vague feelings and a lack of confidence in practice. These difficulties could be exacerbated without the support of team and organisational managers. The implementation of mentorship and the mediation of interprofessional conflicts are necessary to facilitate successful role transitions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) in human-dominated habitats is an important issue in wildlife conservation. Understanding and addressing local people's attitudes and behaviours toward HWC is thought to be imperative for successful human-wildlife co-existence. Despite substantial research and conservation resources being invested to study, protect, and manage HWC globally, research on human perceptions of wildlife is mostly done in silos. Realising the lack of scholarly investigations that focus on such conflicts in urban areas by including perceptions of urban residents, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to identify progress, gaps and future directions of urban wildlife conflict research. Reviewing all studies published globally (n = 124), we identified nuisance urban wildlife and associated conflicts reported by human residents. The findings revealed that most studies, largely focusing on mammals, were conducted in North America. Based on diet, among the 165 trophic groups studied, the majority were omnivores (n = 67), closely followed by carnivores (n = 50) and herbivores (n = 40). Within vertebrate taxa, bear species (brown, black and sloth bear; Ursus spp., Melursus ursinus) were the most conflictual followed by grey wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (Canis latrans). The lack of longitudinal research to understand the trends and shifts in urban wildlife population and changes in human perception and attitudes was a key finding. Therefore, if research is not supplemented by long-term follow-up studies, the resolution of HWC in urban areas will be under evaluated. Furthermore, researchers should consider integrating quantitative and qualitative research methods, such as in-depth or focus group interviews, to understand motivations or perceptions to present a holistic picture for urban wildlife conservation. Perceptions may shift over time, and the human dimension of wildlife may serve as an ecological indicator of ecosystem status, providing valuable insight into how management measures will be accepted by citizens, which is critical for their success.

AB  - The popularity of remanufacturing among the research community resulted in an increase in the number of academic publications in recent years. Quite a number of literature reviews related to reverse logistics, core acquisition management, Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem), production planning, analytical models in remanufacturing were published in various journals. The management of remanufactured products is quite complex due to specific operations like core acquisition, reverse logistics, disassembly, cleaning, repairing and reassembly. This often makes determining the price of remanufactured product a difficult task. Moreover, pricing of remanufactured products acts as a control mechanism to maintain the demand for both new and remanufactured products. A significant number of academic publications have been published regarding pricing and competition decision in remanufacturing. This paper aims to study with a focus on pricing related decisions in remanufacturing through bibliometric analysis that can provide insights into the latest research trends in this area by analysing the most significant and cited papers, authors collaboration network, keywords, countries, and institutions. In this paper, a thorough review and bibliometric analysis are conducted over 336 articles from 2000 until May 2020. The systematic mapping and analysis help to identify developing research areas, key research topics, publication evolution over time, collaboration patterns among authors, countries, the co-occurrence of authors keywords, and future research directions. From the content analysis, we have identified five pricing models such as pricing of remanufactured products under competition, impact of the product lifecycle on remanufacturing pricing, pricing related to product design in remanufacturing, pricing models under an uncertain environment, and optimal pricing under customer willingness-to-pay. We have also identified the decision variables, assumptions, and research objective(s) for each model. The findings of this research provide a direction for a further study in this domain, such as how pricing of a remanufactured products can be done in oligopolistic competition, how an effective product design strategy determines the price of remanufactured product, how the government regulatory policies influence the profitability in remanufacturing, or what is the effect of carbon cap and trade mechanism on the price of remanufactured products.

AB  - Violence against children affects a significant portion of youth around the world. Emergencies and natural disasters escalate the risk due to weakened child protection systems and disruption of preventative mechanisms. In this systematic review, 692 related papers were searched in various databases in the initial search. After review, 11 papers were finally selected for full review. These papers were selected based on publication date, relevance to emergencies, their geographical area type of violence, age of subjects, and their gender. Most families affected by natural disasters, especially those in lower socioeconomic status, face greater social and economic pressures. The families that are more vulnerable to loss of food and shelter commit violence against children more frequently. On the other hand, while the rate of violence increases in emergencies, the reported rate of violence is less than the actual rate due to lack of required infrastructure and reporting mechanisms. The emergency housing increased risk of some types of child abuse. The history of exposure to violence, parental substance abuse, poverty, and child labor were predictors of increased violence against children in emergency situations. Sexual violence against girls after conflicts and physical violence against boys after emergencies are common forms of violence. Poverty as another predictor exposes children to more violence due to limited family economic resources and support. Given the identified predictors of violence, humanitarian organizations can come closer to providing appropriate plans to reduce the risk during and postdisaster.

AB  - Water, energy and food are important for human survival and sustainable development. With climate change, investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food nexus has been a topic of growing interest in recent years. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of the current state and methodologies of Water-Energy-Food nexus studies under climate change. Here, we review research articles investigating climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus over last seven years. The existing methods and tools, spatial scales, and future climate scenarios setting in these articles are summarised and analysed. We found that the analyses methods could be divided into four categories (physics-based modelling, statistical methods, supervised learning and operation optimisation), among them, physics-based modelling accounts for the largest proportion. The reviewed studies cover a range of scales from site scale to global, with most studies focusing on the regional scale. Models used for small to middle scale are mainly related to hydrology and water resource, while large-scale modelling is based on interdisciplinary models. Future climate scenarios setting include emission scenarios and global warming scenarios based on Global Climate Models (GCMs). A number of future research challenges have been identified. These include spatial scale and resolution, internal physical mechanism, application of novel artificial intelligence models, extreme climate events, potential competition in nexus systems as well as data and model uncertainty.

AB  - Higher education institutions' contributions to environmental conservation are manifested in their commitments to develop Sustainable Campuses. Numerous studies have investigated higher education institutions' efforts to create Sustainable Campuses. Many studies on Sustainable Campuses have been completed partially. The analysis is carried out on the basis of practices at various campuses around the world. However, a thorough analysis of Sustainable Campuses has so far not been carried out. This is evidenced by the lack of publications on journal database portals related to Sustainable Campuses which are carried out in a systematic literature review. To address this gap, this study provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on Sustainable Campuses. The purpose of this article is to identify various dimensions of implementing Sustainable Campuses from various countries. We use the qualitative systematic review method with the meta-aggregation approach in this study. The results of this study indicate that Sustainable Campus development activities are classified into three aspects such as behavioral, learning and educational tools, and physical facilities. Further, each dimension has several strategies and programs and actions performed by global higher education institutions. The results are also expected to be a motivator and reference for campuses to contribute to environmental conservation through Sustainable Campus programs. The various dimensions of a Sustainable Campus that are mapped out in this research can be used as a reference for realizing a Sustainable Campus for every university campus in various countries.

AB  - Public transportation provides an opportunity to incorporate physical activity into journeys, but potential health impacts have not been systematically examined. We searched the literature for articles on public transportation and health published through December 2017 using Google (Google Inc., Mountain View, California), 5 medical databases, and 1 transportation-related database. We identified longitudinal studies which examined associations between public transportation and cardiometabolic health (including adiposity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease). We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and performed meta-analyses where possible. Ten studies were identified, 7 investigating use of public transportation and 3 examining proximity to public transportation. Seven studies used individual-level data on changes in body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)), with objective outcomes being measured in 6 studies. Study follow-up ranged from 1 year to 10 years, and 3 studies adjusted for nontransportation physical activity. We found a consistent association between use of public transportation and lower BMI. Meta-analysis of data from 5 comparable studies found that switching from automobile use to public transportation was associated with lower BMI (-0.30 units, 95% confidence interval: -0.47, -0.14). Few studies have investigated associations between public transportation use and nonadiposity outcomes. These findings suggest that sustainable urban design which promotes public transportation use may produce modest reductions in population BMI.

AB  - The need for fundamental changes in the way humans interact with nature is now widely acknowledged in order to achieve sustainable development. Agriculture figures prominently in this quest, being both a major driver and a major threat to global sustainability. Agricultural systems typically have co-evolved with other societal structures-retailers, land management, technology, consumer habits, and environmental and agricultural law-and can therefore well be described as socio-technical regimes in the sense of the sustainability transitions literature. This paper aims to give an overview of the emerging field of governing transitions to sustainability agriculture and the topics and trends covered, focusing on how agricultural transitions are being governed through a variety of actors and at a variety of levels. We conduct a systematic review of 153 articles published before the year 2019. We identify two main perspectives: papers that analyse the status quo in farming practices and reasons for lock-in, and papers that explore potential transition pathways and their governance. Predominantly, papers study (local) niche developments and discuss governance options for upscaling, rather than actual regime change. Seven distinct perspectives emerge from our reading of the selected articles: application of theoretical perspectives from the literature on socio-technical transitions; governance and regulation; knowledge and learning; concrete approaches to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural systems; urbanisation, urban agriculture, and local food networks; the role of agri-food businesses; as well as the role of gender. While a variety of local case studies shows potential for small-scale changes that might be transferable to other regions and higher levels of governance, it generally appears that more integrative, comparative work and perhaps more coherence in conceptual approaches would benefit the currently highly fragmented field.

AB  - In Saudi Arabia, both traditional and modern sports are popular. The facilities required for them are based on the population of the area and the level of participation. There are a few world-class sportspersons in Saudi Arabia and they have won in some competitions. The Saudi sports activities are administered and controlled by the General Presidency of Youth Welfare (GPYW) established in 1974. There are also active programmes to develop sports in educational institutions. Against the above background, the following question assumes relevance: What are the various issues, factors, and challenges of sports management in Saudi Arabia, and how they can be addressed? This review tries to answer this research question through a systematic review. There are obstacles and challenges also. The main obstacle related to the Islamic cultural and social restrictions, especially not permitting women to participate in sports and physical activities. Positive attitudes of male and female university students are affected by the lack of facilities, opportunities, and programmes. Effective interventions by adequate security mechanisms and agencies, backed by appropriate regulations need to be ensured to reduce riots in the stadia. Injuries are a major problem in sports, sometimes incapacitating them lifelong. The effect of the covid pandemic on sports had been serious as it affected the schedules of major sports events all over the world. Some were cancelled and others like the Tokyo Olympics 2020 were postponed. When such sports events are conducted, the risks involved need to be attended to for reducing the impact of covid on the sportspersons, audience, and others. Some modern trends in sports research include flipped classrooms based on neural networks as a method of modernising sports education, the use of exergames to improve the physical activities of hearing-impaired students, and the use of UAV-enabled Internet of Things to track and work on the player safety. Overall, it is safe to say that sports management is at a nascent stage in Saudi Arabia. Addressing the challenges faced in sports management in Saudi Arabia can improve the sporting outcomes for the country..

AB  - Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change. By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities.
   Location: Worldwide.
   Time period: Contemporary.
   Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates.
   Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure.
   Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America.
   Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates. Additionally, our findings provide an impetus for determining the mechanisms associated with changes in vertebrate diversity and abundance in shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes.

AB  - BackgroundMost people prefer to remain in their homes and communities as long as possible. Staying at home is widely beneficial as ageing within the home promotes independence and costs less than residential aged care. Understanding meanings and drivers of remaining at home is an area of importance.ObjectiveThe objective of this systematic review of qualitative studies was to synthesise middle and older aged adult's perspective of their home environment and determine the factors that are important when making decisions about future housing.MethodsThis review and meta-synthesis was conducted in accordance with JBI (formally known as the Joanna Briggs Institute) methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. Meta-aggregation was used as the method of synthesis. Included qualitative studies involved middle and older aged adults and their views about ageing and housing. Published studies were identified in four electronic databases and grey literature. Critical appraisal and extraction were conducted using JBI tools and findings were categorised and synthesised into findings.ResultsA total of 46 papers with 5183 participants on the concept of home were included. Most of the participants were older (> 65 years old) and the perspectives of middle-aged people were largely absent. Factors impacting on future housing decisions among individuals were identified. Seven synthesized findings emerged-independence, finances, stigma, attitudes towards ageing, attachments with home, aesthetics, and family connection.ConclusionOlder people have a greater sense of independence and autonomy if they remain in their own home. Multiple external factors impacted on their perspectives including a sense of stigma about ageing, fear of being a burden to others and their own financial position which in some cases restricted their options. This review provides a comprehensive description of the different factors that need to be considered when planning future housing needs; both for individuals and for communities.

AB  - Background: High-quality clinical practice guidelines are necessary for effective use of resources both at an individual patient- and national-level. Nordic clinical practice guidelines recommendations for orthotic treatment of knee osteoarthritis vary and little is known about their quality. Objectives: The aim of the study was to critically evaluate the quality of clinical practice guidelines in orthotic management of knee osteoarthritis in the Nordic countries. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: Four national clinical practice guidelines for treatment of knee osteoarthritis were assessed for methodological rigour and transparency by four independent assessors using the AGREE II instrument. Summary domain scores and inter-rater agreement (Kendall's W) were calculated. Results: Domain scores indicate that many guidelines have not sufficiently addressed stakeholder involvement (average score: 55%), applicability (20%) and editorial independence (33%) in the development process. Inter-rater agreement for assessors indicated 'good' agreement for clinical practice guidelines from Finland, Norway and Sweden (W = 0.653, p < 0.001; W = 0.512, p = 0.003 and W = 0.532, p = 0.002, respectively) and 'strong' agreement for the clinical practice guideline from Denmark (W = 0.800, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Quality of clinical practice guidelines for orthotic treatment of knee osteoarthritis in the Nordic region is variable. Future guideline development should focus on improving methodology by involving relevant stakeholders (e.g. certified prosthetist/orthotists (CPOs)), specifying conflicts of interest and providing guidance for implementation.

AB  - Introduction While health is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many other 'health-related' goals comprise determinants of health. Integrated implementation across SDGs is needed for the achievement of Agenda 2030. While existing literature is rich in normative recommendations about potentially useful approaches, evidence of implementation strategies being adopted by countries is limited. Methods We conducted a systematic review with qualitative synthesis of findings using peer reviewed and grey literature from key databases. We included publications examining implementation of health and health-related SDGs (HHSDGs) at national or subnational level published between June 2013 and July 2019. Results Of the 32 included publications, 24 provided information at the national level while eight provided information for multiple countries or regions. Our findings indicate that high-level political commitment is evident in most countries and HHSDGs are being aligned with existing national development strategies and plans. A multisectoral, integrated approach is being adopted in institutional setups but evidence on effectiveness of these approaches is limited. Funding constraints are a major challenge for many countries. HHSDGs are generally being financed from within existing funded plans and, in some instances, through SDG-specific budgeting and tracking; additional funding is being mobilised by increasing domestic taxation and subsidisation, and by collaborating with development partners and private sector. Equity is being promoted by improving health service access through universal health coverage and social insurance schemes, especially for disadvantaged populations. Governments are collaborating with development partners and UN agencies for support in planning, institutional development and capacity building. However, evidence on equity promotion, capacity building initiatives and implementation approaches at subnational level is limited. Lack of coordination among various levels of government emerges as a key challenge. Conclusion strengthening implementation of multisectoral work, capacity building, financial sustainability and data availability are key considerations to accelerate implementation of HHSDGs.

AB  - In the aquaculture feed industry, fishmeal is widely used as a source of animal protein due to its high palatability, excellent amino acid profile and increased digestibility. However, the incorporation of fishmeal in aquaculture diets increases the costs of production due to the declining wild fish stocks hence an urgent need to search for sustainable and cheaper alternative protein sources. The use of fermented plant proteins as substitutes for fishmeal in aquaculture diets has recently gained attention due to their improved nutritional quality, easy availability and low costs. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to quantify the effects of fermented plant proteins as substitutes for fishmeal on the growth performance, feed utilisation, survival, antioxidant, metabolic and digestive enzyme activity of several aquaculture species. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that replacement of fishmeal with fermented plant proteins in aquaculture diets enhanced the growth performance, feed utilisation, antioxidant and digestive enzyme activities of several aquaculture species regardless of experimental duration and source of fermented plant protein. Likewise, metabolic enzyme activity (i.e., Alanine aminotransferase and Aspartate aminotransferase) was reduced in experimental dietary treatment groups relative to the fishmeal control groups. To elucidate the influence of moderators on the observed effect sizes, a mixed-effects model was conducted and the results indicated that fishmeal substitution levels and aquaculture species influenced the observed effect sizes in both antioxidant and digestive enzyme activity. No significant differences were noted in survival between the experimental dietary treatment groups and fishmeal control diets among all aquaculture species. However, carnivorous marine species exhibited lower values for specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio in experimental dietary treatment groups compared to the fishmeal control diets. Likewise, freshwater species exhibited poor FCR values in experimental dietary treatment groups relative to the fishmeal control diets. Overall, the replacement of fishmeal with fermented plant proteins in aquaculture diets is a safe and viable solution for increased and sustainable aquaculture production.

AB  - Green infrastructure improves environmental health in cities, benefits human health, and provides habitat for wildlife. Increasing urbanization has demanded the expansion of urban areas and transformation of existing cities. The adoption of compact design in urban planning is a recommended strategy to minimize environmental impacts; however, it may undermine green infrastructure networks within cities as it sets a battleground for urban space. Under this scenario, multifunctionality of green spaces is highly desirable but reconciling human needs and biodiversity conservation in a limited space is still a challenge. Through a systematic review, we first compiled urban green space's characteristics that affect mental health and urban wildlife support, and then identified potential synergies and trade-offs between these dimensions. A framework based on the One Health approach is proposed, synthesizing the interlinkages between green space quality, mental health, and wildlife support; providing a new holistic perspective on the topic. Looking at the human-wildlife-environment relationships simultaneously may contribute to practical guidance on more effective green space design and management that benefit all dimensions.

AB  - Surging incidents of air quality-related public health hazards, and environmental degradation, have prompted the global authorities to seek newer avenues of air quality monitoring, especially in developing economies, where the situation appears most alarming besides difficulties around 'adequate' deployment of air quality sensors. In the present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) around recent global literature (2002-2022), around moss-based passive biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a complementary means to fill 'gaps' in existing air quality records. Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123 documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since 1990, which aptly showcases mosses as 'naturally occurring' sensors of ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions, land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more targeted research to fill in the 'gaps' in our current understanding of moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies.

AB  - Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the research of ecosystem services valuation has seen an exponential growth with a consequent development, improvement, and spread of different qualitative and quantitative methods. The interest is due to the benefits that ecosystem services provide for human wellbeing. A large part of ecosystem services is provided by the so-called forest ecosystem services (FES) in both protected and non-protected areas. The aim of the present study is to investigate key variables driving the FES value at the global level. These include, other than socio-economic information, the ecosystem services' quality condition and the location of the study. The research uses a meta-regression of 478 observations from 57 studies in the time span 1992-2021 retrieved from the online Ecosystem Service Valuation Database (ESVD). The main results show that both the ES quality condition and spatial aspect are relevant factors in determining the estimated value of FES, suggesting the existence of a difference in the forest value from a North-South perspective. The investigation of an economic assessment of FES is advised as a key research trend in the immediate future. This allows to close the gap between the global North and South and favors the implementation of adequate socio-economic and environmental governance for an efficient forest management.

AB  - COVID-19 has altered many aspects of everyday life. For the scientific community, the pandemic has called upon investigators to continue work in novel ways, curtailing field and lab research. However, this unprecedented situation also offers an opportunity for researchers to optimize and further develop available field methods. Camera traps are one example of a tool used in science to answer questions about wildlife ecology, conservation, and management. Camera traps have long battery lives, lasting more than a year in certain cases, and photo storage capacity, with some models capable of wirelessly transmitting images from the field. This allows researchers to deploy cameras without having to check them for up to a year or more, making them an ideal field research tool during restrictions on in-person research activities such as COVID-19 lockdowns. As technological advances allow cameras to collect increasingly greater numbers of photos and videos, the analysis techniques for large amounts of data are evolving. Here, we describe the most common research questions suitable for camera trap studies and their importance for biodiversity conservation. As COVID-19 continues to affect how people interact with the natural environment, we discuss novel questions for which camera traps can provide insights on. We conclude by summarizing the results of a systematic review of camera trap studies, providing data on target taxa, geographic distribution, publication rate, and publication venues to help researchers planning to use camera traps in response to the current changes in human activity.

AB  - Weedy species invasions are a huge problem in rangeland and natural areas as they degrade the quality and quantity of forage for livestock and reduce biodiversity. Weed suppression using native grasses is an ecologically driven method of weed management, representing an opportunity for low-input and management over long temporal scales if these systems can be successfully established. A systemic literature review was conducted to explore the interactions between native grasses and weeds, and revealed the potential of native grasses to provide a reduction in weed presence through interactions with other biological communities. We proposed the merging of agronomic and breeding techniques with restoration efforts such as using specialized seeding techniques to establish native grasses in these systems. A generalized planning framework for land managers is also presented, emphasizing the consideration of functional traits for competitive advantage against weeds and germplasm availability as the main considerations for species selection. Management strategies that provide advantages to native grasses such as land clearance and strategic disturbances were also discussed. Suppression can occur through a variety of mechanisms including direct competition with weeds, indirect interactions through trophic levels of arthropods and grazers, and human-induced disturbances. From our results, we believe that native grasses can potentially play an important role in efficacious weed suppression if utilized tactfully.

AB  - Nature-based tourism, which includes visits to protected areas, is a growing trend. This may include consumptive and non-consumptive activities, with nature-based tourists being motivated to experience local culture and nature. Thus, tourism can contribute economically and socially to communities associated with protected areas, with the outcomes being both benefits and costs to local people. We carried out a systematic literature review to document and characterise the outcomes of nature-based tourism for people living in and around protected areas (terrestrial and inland waters). We evaluated 89 papers published from 1996 to 2020, most of which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The main benefits were employment, business opportunities and income, and the main costs were acculturation and abandonment of traditional lifestyle/practices, price inflation and conflict/crime. While most benefits were economic, most costs were socio-cultural. We found that benefits were most frequently experienced individually and costs experienced mostly at the collective or community levels. Inconsistencies in reporting of impacts suggests that future research should take a more consistent and systematic approach to evaluating benefits and costs of nature-based tourism from both the demographic and geographic perspectives, be more inclusive, and pay equal attention to objective and subjective measures of costs and benefits.

AB  - Harvesting of marine invertebrates in intertidal areas often comes into conflict with conservation objectives for waterbird populations of the orders Anseriformes and Charadri-iformes. We present a meta-analysis of the relationships between benthic invertebrate communities and various sources of intertidal harvesting disturbance to investigate impacts and recovery in bird prey resources. The effect size (Hedges' d) of harvesting on benthic species abundance, diversity and biomass was calculated for 38 studies in various locations globally, derived from 16 publications captured through a systematic review process that met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria. A negative response to harvesting disturbance was found for all taxa, including both target and non-target species, that represent important types of waterbird prey. Impacts appear most severe from hand-gathering, which significantly reduces the abundance of target polychaete species, a key prey group for many bird species. Across all gear types, non-target species demonstrate a larger reduction in abundance compared to target species. Recovery trends vary, with differences observed between taxonomic groups and gear/habitat combinations. Abundance of bivalve molluscs, a potentially highly profitable bird prey item, is suppressed for > 60 d by mechanical dredging in intertidal mud, while annelid and crustacean abundances demonstrate near recovery over the same period. Data suggest that recovery following harvesting in sandier habitats may in some cases take as long as or longer than in muddy sediments. We recommend management measures to minimise disturbance to benthic prey resources and support conservation objectives for waterbird populations to meet international legal requirements.

AB  - Research on urban forests has expanded in the last 30 years in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, urban forestry has been explored to much less extent in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, despite being one of the most urbanized and biodiverse regions in the world. We address this gap by providing a baseline understanding of urban forest research in the region based on a systematic review of the academic literature. Of the 55,000 studies found, 195 were selected for review, and 182 were analysed and synthesized. These studies came from 13 countries and were published from 1970 to mid-2018 (inclusive) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Almost half of the studies were based in Brazil, followed by Mexico and Chile. To comparatively assess article output by country, we accounted for country population and Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico had higher than average per capita article output. Most articles were ecological studies (64%) that used field surveys (58%) to research urban vegetation diversity. Most ecological studies did not include any social or management considerations. Only a few studies focused on spatiotemporal dynamics (12%) or the direct opinions of stakeholders (9%). We observed a notable increase in article output from the region during the last decade. The units of analysis targeted by these studies mostly focused on single trees in public areas (streets and parks). Understanding urban forests regionally could be strengthened by scaling up research across multiple units of analysis and across regional cities, which could provide a better understanding of regional spatiotemporal dynamics. To respond to current global trends and nurture regional strengths, research could also focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by urban forests, and the relationship of urban forests with poverty, crime, climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and social equity. These findings can inform key stakeholders in the region managing urban forests and trees about research trends and gaps to be filled. This article shows that the region indeed has an important body of research in urban forestry that should be recognized in global assessments.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (CESs) are direct influences on human well-being and sustainable development, and they have become increasingly important in the development and progress of society. This paper reviewed 1248 papers on CESs by using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. On this basis, we also reviewed 179 selected empirical papers related to this field, with regards to geographical locations, study objects, evaluation methods, and categories. The results show that: (1) the number of publications related to cultural services has increased year by year, and Ecosystem Services, Ecological Indicators, and Sustainability are the top three journals with the greatest amount of research published; (2) ecosystem services, benefits, management, and social-ecological systems are perceptions closely related to CES research, which are also popular topics in the field; (3) the results of a keyword detection show that the cultural landscapes, patterns, mental health services, social value, and other keywords were popular keywords used from 2005 to 2021; (4) CESs have mainly attracted the attention of many developed countries, and the cultural services in cities, oceans, and coastal areas have become the focus for researchers; (5) the recreation and ecotourism, and aesthetic values are the common categories of the CES empirical studies, while the knowledge system and the cultural diversity are the two categories with the least amount of research; (6) the evaluation methods of CESs are mostly carried out using a traditional questionnaire and interview, but mapping and modeling methods have been widely used in recent years.

AB  - Mexico has more than 750,000 ha of mangroves and more than 400,000 ha of seagrasses. However, approximately 200,000 ha of mangroves and an unknown area of seagrass have been lost due to coastal development associated with urban, industrial and tourist purposes. In 2018, the approved reforms to the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) aligned the Mexican law with the international objectives established in the 2nd Article of the Paris Agreement. This action proves Mexico's commitment to contributing to the global target of stabilizing the greenhouse gas emissions concentration in the planet. Thus, restoring and conserving mangrove and seagrass habitats could contribute to fulfilling this commitment. Therefore, as a first step in establishing a mitigation and adaptation plan against climate change with respect to conservation and restoration actions of these ecosystems, we evaluated Mexican blue carbon ecosystems through a systematic review of the carbon stock using the standardized method of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We used the data from 126 eligible studies for both ecosystems (n = 1220). The results indicated that information is missing at the regional level. However, the average above and below ground organic carbon stocks from mangroves in Mexico is 113.6 +/- 5.5 (95% CI [99.3-118.4]) Mg C-org ha(-1) and 385.1 +/- 22 (95% CI [344.5 431.9]) Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively. The variability in the C-org stocks for both blue carbon ecosystems in Mexico is related to variations in climate, hydrology and geomorphology observed along the country's coasts in addition to the size and number of plots evaluated with respect to the spatial cover. The highest values for mangroves were related to humid climate conditions, although in the case of seagrasses, they were related to low levels of hydrodynamic stress. Based on the official extent of mangrove and seagrass area in Mexico, we estimate a total carbon stock of 237.7 Tg C-org from mangroves and 48.1 Tg C-org from seagrasses. However, mangroves and seagrasses are still being lost due to land use change despite Mexican laws meant to incorporate environmental compensation. Such losses are largely due to loopholes in the legal framework that dilute the laws' effectiveness and thus ability to protect the ecosystem. The estimated emissions from land use change under a conservative approach in mangroves of Mexico were approximately 24 Tg CO(2)e in the last 20 years. Therefore, the incorporation of blue carbon into the carbon market as a viable source of supplemental finance for mangrove and seagrass protection is an attractive win-win opportunity.

AB  - Concerns about anthropogenic climate change have resulted in promotion of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy. A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distriuted windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anscriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are require. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.

AB  - Since the institutionalization of biodiversity conservation in the 1980s, co-management has been employed as an economic policy for regulating the joint use of natural resources. However, barriers to its effectiveness may at times arise, as when imported initiatives are poorly acculturated to local needs. Inspired by contributions on the commons, globalization, and critical policy studies, we examine lapses in co-management and related natural resource governance practices, using a systematic review of policy publications on nature-reliant communities in the global South and North. The conclusions propose options through which a "localized co-management" may help enhance the inclusion of local/indigenous people in making decisions concerning the use of natural resources.

AB  - The interaction and the interplay of climate change with oil palm production in the Southeast Asia region are of serious concern. This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

AB  - The choice of great places for installation of solar power plants has become a key issue in terms of project planning because of the increased number of investments in the photovoltaic sector. This study is a systematic review of the literature that seeks to identify the determining factors in choosing the best location for solar photovoltaic power plants, through previous research on the application of renewable energy technologies in great contexts of location. Among a total of 130 academic studies filtered by the keywords "photovoltaic energy," "power plants," "location," and "factor" on the bases ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE, a total of 27 studies were identified. These articles were carefully explored, including years of publication, countries of origin, and identification of factors that each author demonstrated. It has been extracted 28 factors, organized in six points of view: socioenvironmental, location, economic, political, climatic, and orographic. It was verified that the determining factors for choosing the best locations are solar irradiation, substation distance, slope, distance of roads, distance from urban areas, and land use. The results of this research may assist academic students and investors in identifying factors that they should consider in their decision making and may also assist in the efficient planning of renewable energy management to ensure the sustainable development of power generation through the photovoltaic source.

AB  - Sacred natural sites (SNS) have gained recognition from conservationists, and are regarded as the oldest form of habitat protection in human history. Many case studies and literature reviews have been published on the subject. However, an updated and global-level synthesis on the effect of SNS on biodiversity conservation is still lacking. Here, we provide the first systematic review on SNS and biodiversity conservation, aiming to evaluate the effect of SNS across different: (i) continents; (ii) taxa; (iii) metrics. We checked 2750 papers and by applying inclusion criteria we selected 27 relevant papers. From these, we extracted descriptive data and 131 comparisons between SNS and Reference Sites. We applied vote-counting, multinomial and binomial post-hoc tests to the 131 comparisons. We found strong evidence that SNS have a positive effect on biodiversity, but also strong geographical and taxonomical biases, with most research focusing on Asia and Africa and on plants. We found that SNS have mainly positive effects on taxonomical diversity, vegetation structure and cultural uses of biodiversity. Our results strongly support the view that SNS have positive effects on biodiversity across continents and geographical settings, as found in a number of local studies and earlier overviews. These effects should be given official recognition in appropriate conservation frameworks, together with the specific forms of governance and management that characterize SNS. At the same time, further efforts are also required to fill the geographical and taxonomical gaps here highlighted, and to advancing our knowledge of SNS through more systematic research.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon ecosystems can be an important nature-based solution for mitigating climate change, when emphasis is given to their protection, management, and restoration. Globally, there has been a rapid increase in blue carbon research in the last few decades, with substantial investments on national scales by the European Union, the USA, Australia, Seychelles, and Belize. Blue carbon ecosystems in South and Southeast Asia are globally diverse, highly productive and could represent a global hotspot for carbon sequestration and storage. To guide future efforts, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on two primary blue carbon ecosystems-seagrasses and mangroves-across 13 countries in South and Southeast Asia to assess existing national inventories, review current research trends and methodologies, and identify existing knowledge gaps. Information related to various aspects of seagrass and mangrove ecosystems was extracted from 432 research articles from 1967 to 2022. We find that: (1) blue carbon estimates in several countries have limited data, especially for seagrass meadows compared to mangrove ecosystems, although the highest reported carbon stocks were in Indonesia and the Philippines with 4,515 and 707 Tg within mangrove forest and 60.9 and 63.3 Tg within seagrass meadows, respectively; (2) there is a high difference in the quantity and quality of data between mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, and the methodologies used for blue carbon estimates are highly variable across countries; and (3) most studies on blue carbon stocks are spatially biased towards more familiar study areas of individual countries, than several lesser-known suspected blue carbon hotspots. In sum, our review demonstrates the paucity and variability in current research in the region, and highlights research frontiers that should be addressed by future research before the robust implementation of these ecosystems into national climate strategies.

AB  - What Is New and Objectives Older people from ethnic minorities experience the intersectionality of age and ethnicity in relation to complex medication management and polypharmacy. Minority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom are at risk of poor medication management because factors such as cultural beliefs, language barriers, lack of knowledge of how the healthcare system works may affect their ability to safely manage their medications. The aim of this systematic review was to review the literature focussing on medication management in the older population amongst ethnic minority communities in United Kingdom. Methods The review was conducted and reported according to methods in the Cochrane Handbook and in the PRISMA 2020 statement using databases such as EMBASE, ASSIA, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and others. Studies conducted in the United Kingdom on individuals over 60 years of age and from a minority ethnic background were included. A thematic analysis was used to synthesize the results. Results and Discussion Nine studies (eight from initial searches, one from a search update in 2021) met the inclusion criteria. Three main themes were identified: misbeliefs around medications, poor health literacy, communication and education as possible intervention to improve medication management. Misbeliefs around long-term illnesses exert a negative impact on medication management. Poor health literacy around medications influences patients' adherence to treatments. Poor communication is perceived as barrier to successful medication management. Despite extensive searching, the team identified a limited number of studies and a lack of intersectional studies focussing on minority ethnic groups and the older population. What is New and Conclusion Our findings suggest tailored education as a possible intervention to improve medication management amongst these minority groups. Future research should look at recruiting participants from specific ethnic groups and from rural as well as urban areas to explore how medication management operates in different areas of the United Kingdom.

AB  - Tropical forests are widely recognized for providing valuable ecosystem services (ES), but their existence is increasingly under pressure. The production of policy-relevant ES science is important to effectively convey their value. The main objective of this review is to insight into the associations between scientific knowledge, policy domains and ES categories to identify gaps for advancing further research and improve ES policy-making. For this purpose, we developed a classification system and conducted a systematic review of publications between 2000 and 2020 that focus on the Amazon, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the main tropical forest and tropical savannah biomes of South America. The review results indicated high heterogeneity across the biomes. Valuation studies were least prominent in comparison with other categories, whereas descriptive studies dominated ES science in South America. Scientific contributions tended to cluster around central themes of global environ-mental governance, including GHG emissions. The research peaks and gaps identified for the three biomes can stimulate new knowledge production efforts and inform regionally specific evidence-based policies for enhancing ES programs and policies in South America.

AB  - The present article aims to explain why community-based natural resource management and tourism certification are the main concerns in academic literature on tourism sustainability implementation. The method of choice is a systematic review of literature based on the Prisma Statement for Systematic Reviews. Sources of interest were identified within the Web of Science Core Collection and other repositories. From a total of 430 records screened, 106 stable documents were selected and submitted to content analysis to create a matrix coding of mentions of sustainable tourism implementation in highly cited publications. A content analysis revealed that sustainable tourism implementation encompasses eight sub-categories of interest in current research outputs. Those sub-categories are: (1) Adaptive resource management (ARM), (2) Carbon mitigation approach; (3) Community-based Conservation Areas (CCAs) and Community-based ecotourism; (4) Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM); (5) Multiobjective Optimization model (6) Social reinvestment strategy; (7) Tourism Sustainability Certification and (8) Transition Management. The analysis revealed that implementation strategies such as Community-based natural resource management and the Tourism Certification Approach, covered 60 percent of all mentions of methods of sustainability implementation in the literature selected and should be treated as leading accelerators of tourism sustainability, yet much work needs to be done explain how and why a certain destination or tourism business meet set standards over time and across national contexts.

AB  - Even-though the last years have seen a "blossoming" of initiatives aiming to clarify the link between biodiversity (BD)-ecosystem functions (EF)-ecosystem services (ES)-human well-being (HWB), there is still a need for integrating the knowledge obtained by various research, making it useful for decision makers. This contribution aims to show ways of gathering, representing and modelling these linkages to enable better decision-making based on available knowledge. This is achieved by: (i) conducting a systematic -review of contributions describing the links between BD-EF-ES-HWB and gathering the information into a database; (ii) organizing that information in a mind-map; (iii) showing, as an example, how a Bayesian Network model and scenarios can be built using the mind-map and database information. We show how gathering information into mind-maps works as a first step to the creation of a unified knowledge base, while Bayesian Network models allow for a better management of data uncertainty, commonly associated with the representation of complex models, as well as providing the possibility of creating future scenarios where assumptions can be tested. Thus, this contribution shows how available knowledge can be linked to improve our understanding of complex issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reviews the most commonly used scales for measuring service quality in sustainable tourism destinations to analyse if the requirements of tourists with special needs are considered. Results highlight that most of the recent research on service quality in tourism published in scientific journals is focused on a relative reduced number of validated scales. Variables related to tourists with special needs are often omitted or represent a reduced weight in the complete scale. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of including variables that collect the perceptions of service quality in this target group to better understand the individual perception of service quality and to move forward to sustainable tourism, considering the social dimension.

AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services to reduce climate change impacts to local communities. Because plants can alleviate the abiotic and biotic stresses of climate change, purposeful plant choices could improve adaptation. However, there has been no systematic review of how plants can be applied to alleviate effects of climate change. Here we describe how plants can modify climate change effects by altering biological and physical processes. Plant effects range from increasing soil stabilization to reducing the impact of flooding and storm surges. Given the global scale of plant-related activities such as farming, landscaping, forestry, conservation, and restoration, plants can be selected strategically Le., planting and maintaining particular species with desired impacts to simultaneously restore degraded ecosystems, conserve ecosystem function, and help alleviate effects of climate change. Plants are a tool for EbA that should be more broadly and strategically utilized.

AB  - Scaling up electric vehicles (EVs) provides an avenue to mitigate both carbon emissions and air pollution from road transport. The benefits of EV adoption for climate, air quality, and health have been widely documented. Yet, evidence on the distribution of these impacts has not been systematically reviewed, despite its central importance to ensure a just and equitable transition. Here, we perform a systematic review of recent EV studies that have examined the spatial distribution of the emissions, air pollution, and health impacts, as an important aspect of the equity implications. Using the Context-Interventions-Mechanisms-Outcome framework with a two-step search strategy, we narrowed down to 47 papers that met our inclusion criteria for detailed review and synthesis. We identified two key factors that have been found to influence spatial distributions. First, the cross-sectoral linkages may result in unintended impacts elsewhere. For instance, the generation of electricity to charge EVs, and the production of batteries and other materials to manufacture EVs could increase the emissions and pollution in locations other than where EVs are adopted. Second, since air pollution and health are local issues, additional location-specific factors may play a role in determining the spatial distribution, such as the wind transport of pollution, and the size and vulnerability of the exposed populations. Based on our synthesis of existing evidence, we highlight two important areas for further research: (1) fine-scale pollution and health impact assessment to better characterize exposure and health disparities across regions and population groups; and (2) a systematic representation of the EV value chain that captures the linkages between the transport, power and manufacturing sectors as well as the regionally-varying activities and impacts.

AB  - Incidences of forest fires have increased in recent decades largely as a result of climate change and human factors, resulting in great environmental and socioeconomic losses. Post-fire forest restoration is therefore indispensable for maintaining forest ecological integrity and for the sustainability of the affected forest landscapes. In this study, we conduct a systematic review of the available literature on forest restoration in the past two decades (2002-2022) and propose a comprehensive framework for consideration in forest restoration after the occurrence of forest fires. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model was adopted for this study, where three academic literature databases (Scopus, CAB Direct, Web of Science), the Google Scholar search engine, and specialized websites were used for literature searches. A final list of 36 records from the initial 732 was considered for this study after the screening stage and subsequent inclusion/exclusion of articles as per the stipulated eligibility criteria. The study findings reveal a dearth of information in the field of post-fire forest restoration in an integrated, balanced, and comprehensive manner, as there was no single methodology or unified protocol that guides post-fire forest restoration. There was also a notable bias in the geographical distribution of the relevant studies in restoration as influenced by economic prosperity, political stability, and scientific and technical advancement. This study recommends a 6-criteria comprehensive framework with 29 indicators for post-fire forest restoration based on the reviewed studies. The criteria integrate environmental, economic, social, cultural and aesthetic, management, infrastructure, and education objectives in their design and implementation for better outcomes in achieving the restoration goals.

AB  - Genome-scale metabolic networks for model plants and crops in combination with approaches from the constraint-based modelling framework have been used to predict metabolic traits and design metabolic engineering strategies for their manipulation. With the advances in technologies to generate large-scale genotyping data from natural diversity panels and other populations, genome-wide association and genomic selection have emerged as statistical approaches to determine genetic variants associated with and predictive of traits. Here, we review recent advances in constraint-based approaches that integrate genetic variants in genome-scale metabolic models to characterize their effects on reaction fluxes. Since some of these approaches have been applied in organisms other than plants, we provide a critical assessment of their applicability particularly in crops. In addition, we further dissect the inferred effects of genetic variants with respect to reaction rate constants, abundances of enzymes, and concentrations of metabolites, as main determinants of reaction fluxes and relate them with their combined effects on complex traits, like growth. Through this systematic review, we also provide a roadmap for future research to increase the predictive power of statistical approaches by coupling them with mechanistic models of metabolism.

AB  - Food losses and waste (FLW) is considered a critical issue in the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agri-food systems. However, the scholarly literature on FLW is still geographically-biased, with more attention devoted to developed countries, even in Europe. In this context, this article analyses the state of research on FLW in the Western Balkan region (viz. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia). A search performed in October 2021 on the Web of Science database returned 34 documents, and 21 eligible ones were included in the systematic review. The topical analysis of the literature addressed causes of FLW, stages of the food supply chain, extent and magnitude of FLW, FLW and food security, economic and environmental impacts of FLW, and food waste (FW) management strategies. A central finding was the scarcity of data on FW in the Western Balkans. Moreover, the literature focused on FW at the consumer level, while food loss at other stages of the food chain was generally overlooked. There is a lack of comprehensive analyses of the economic and environmental impacts of FLW as well as its implications in terms of food and nutrition security. The quantification of FLW is generally inaccurate and based on estimates and self-reported data. The literature focuses on FW reuse and recycling (e.g., energy, compost) while other management strategies (e.g., reduction/prevention, redistribution) are rarely addressed. However, the results indicated that consumers in the Western Balkans pay attention to the FW issue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an encouraging sign that can be exploited in awareness-raising campaigns and education activities. Meanwhile, research on FLW in the Western Balkans is highly needed to fill the identified knowledge gap and provide evidence to policies dealing with the transition to sustainable food systems in the region.

AB  - Low impact development (LID) has been increasingly practiced since its emergence in the 1990s. Although the hydrological benefits of LIDs have been extensively documented, the climate impact on LID performance remains unclear with increasing variations in spatial and temporal climate patterns. This systematic review contributes to providing a structured summary of research on how LID systems are sensitive to climate variability by empirical and hypothetical research approaches. The selected 46 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2003 and 2017 were analyzed by key variables, including climatic factors, LID types, and hydrologic measures used to quantify LID performance. A conceptual framework formulated in this study synthesizes the relationship between climate and LID effectiveness. The results of weighted meta-analysis reveal a greater sensitivity of runoff volume to changing storm frequency than peak discharge rates, while the capacity of LID systems to reduce both volume and peak discharge rates diminishes with increasing storm intensity. Future explorations of the sensitivity of LIDs to climate fluctuations will help strategize LID installation for targeted storm patterns and flood mitigation goals. To enhance existing methods and make a balance between empirical and hypothetical knowledge, this study suggests future directions of research and encourages development of effective stormwater management policy.

AB  - Introduction:Biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystems services are intrinsically dependent on the climate. During the twentieth century, climate change has posed major threats to biodiversity in Africa, and impacts are expected to increase as climate change continues and perhaps even accelerates.
   Outcomes: Our review shows that the multiple components of climate change are projected to affect all levels of biodiversity, from genes over species to biome level. Loss of biodiversity as a result of climate change can alter the structures and functions of African ecological systems. As a result, the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services and the well-being of people that rely on these services are being modified. Of particular concerns are "tipping points" where the exceedance of ecosystem thresholds will possibly lead to irreversible shifts of the structure of ecosystems and their services. In recent years, climate prediction models have portended continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the region. Such weather-related disturbances such as El Nino will place a premium on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services that people rely on.
   Conclusion: As biodiversity underlies all goods and services provided by ecosystems that are crucial for human survival and well-being, this paper synthesizes and discusses observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem service provision and livelihoods, and what strategies might be employed to decrease current and future risks on the well-being of human in Africa.

AB  - More frequent and severe coral bleaching events are prompting managers to seek practical interventions to promote ecosystem resilience. Although resilience-based management is now well established theoretically, there have been few examples of implementation. In Hawai'i, back-to-back bleaching events in 2014 and 2015 caused significant damage motivating the state to seek guidance on next steps for recovery. Hawai'i is a unique case study in distilling global recommendations to place-based action because of its ecological and social diversity. This study conducted a systematic review of literature using a weighted point system to evaluate and rank twelve potential Hawai'i-specific interventions to promote coral recovery following a bleaching event. Papers were scored based on their ability to achieve their management objective as well as their ability to directly affect coral recovery. A total of 100 papers were included in the review which varied in their scale (multi-site or case study), location (inside or outside of Hawah), and type of data collected (theoretical or empirical). Establishing a network of herbivore management areas ranked the highest followed by parrotfish size limits for action that could promote recovery in Hawai'i. Establishing a network of no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was the intervention with the most literature and ranked third. This method provided a systematic way to compare the effectiveness of management interventions, a system that could be adapted to other regions. This type of evidence-based approach can lead to more fair and transparent decision-making processes, assisting reef managers in navigating the translation of resilience-based management from theory to practice.

AB  - Pig and poultry production systems have reached high-performance levels over the last few decades. However, there is still room for improvement when it comes to their environmental sustainability. This issue is even more relevant due to the growing demand for food demand since this surplus food production needs to be met at an affordable cost with minimum impact on the environment. This study presents a systematic review of peer-reviewed manuscripts that investigated the environmental impacts associated with pig and poultry production. For this purpose, independent reviews were performed and two databases were constructed, one for each production system. Previous studies published in peer-reviewed journals were considered for the databases if the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to pig (pork meat) or poultry (broiler meat or table eggs) production to estimate at least the potential effects of climate change, measured as CO2-eq. Studies considering the cradle-to-farm gate were considered, as well as those evaluating processes up to the slaughterhouse or processor gate. The pig database comprised 55 studies, while 30 publications were selected for the poultry database. These studies confirmed feeding (which includes the crop cultivation phase, manufacturing processes, and transportation) as the main contributor to the environmental impact associated with pig and poultry production systems. Several studies evaluated feeding strategies, which were indicated as viable alternatives to mitigate the environmental footprint associated with both production chains. In this study, precision feeding techniques are highlighted given their applicability to modern pig and poultry farming. These novel feeding strategies are good examples of innovative strategies needed to break paradigms, improve resource-use efficiency, and effectively move the current productive scenario toward more sustainable livestock systems.

AB  - The demand for sustainable agricultural technologies still lags behind the supply confirming the demand articulation failure of transformational innovation change agricultural policies. To understand the reasons for demand shortcomings, the evaluation of developed policies is required. In the literature, there is little evidence on this topic, henceforth, this paper conducts a systematic review of the primary methodological approaches used to assess the influence of policies on the dissemination of agricultural innovations. The results showed that there are two clusters of evaluation; the first investigates how policies affect agricultural innovation adoption, and the second studies how policies affect yields and profitability. For the first cluster, 70% of the studies analyzed adoption decisions using the Double-hurdle, Probit, or Tobit models or captured changes in adoption levels over time using the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool and discrete-time duration models. This cluster is related to the assessment of the input and output additionalities of innovation policies. In 58% of the studies related to the second cluster, the focus was the assessment of economic and environmental implications using mathematical programming models, particularly agent-based modeling. The purpose of evaluation in this cluster is more focused on behavioral additionality. There were no experimental or quasi-experimental methods among the methods utilized in this cluster. The majority of studies do not incorporate the evaluation of economic, social, and environmental aspects together; therefore, evaluation outlooks suggest increasing interest in sustainability impact. It is suggested that models from both clusters be used in combination to explore input, output, and behavioral additionalities simultaneously. Furthermore, including white-box evaluation approaches to evaluate demand-oriented innovation policy in the agricultural sector, in addition to usual black-box approaches, is a necessity.

AB  - Most studies to date assume that there are multiple relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being, but there are few studies that quantify these relationships. Our objectives were: (1) to investigate the trends and understudied areas within ecosystem services and well-being research; and (2) within these general trends, to analyze to what extent the linkages between ecosystem services and well-being presented in empirical research in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were part of a tested hypothesis, and to assess which conceptual frameworks were used in understanding this interface. The results of this study highlighted that most publications assumed that ecosystem services and wellbeing were interlinked but did not analyze their relationship as part of the hypothesis to test. While different frameworks on well-being were adopted by empirical research, only one out of the 29 post-Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) conceptual frameworks that illustrate the linkages between ecosystem services and well-being was documented, and most case studies adopted the MEA. Finally, trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and disaggregated well-being were understudied. Considering these knowledge gaps in future studies will help empirical ecosystem services research to simultaneously contribute to improved well-being and environmental sustainability when applied at multiple policy or institutional levels.

AB  - Humans worldwide depend on ecosystems and the services they provide. Land use and land cover change increasingly, influencing ecosystem values to the extent that the rate and direction of change occurred. The objective of this study was to review the link between changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and Ecosystem Service Value (ESV), with emphasis on mountainous landscapes in Ethiopia. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. Area-specific and country-level studies showed that the ESV changed as the result of the LULC changes in the country. The change in land use in Ethiopia resulted not only in the loss of ESVs but also in the gain of ESVs depending on the type of man's activity. Negative change in LULC-especially the deterioration of land cover types such as forest land, shrub land and grass land-resulted in the loss of ESVs, whereas positive LULC change increased the value of ESVs. In Ethiopia, there is a loss of about USD 85 billion per year from the loss of ecosystem services. To save, improve and promote ESVs, land restoration and rehabilitation activities are important. The review provides insights into the need for and focus of future studies on LULC changes and the valuing of ESVs to understand the impact of changes in LULC on ESVs, considering existing and forecasted population increase in rapidly urbanizing areas.

AB  - Purpose The present study is a systematic review that identifies future research avenues on culture and discipline in secondary schools in a cross-cultural context. Design/methodology/approach The literature, as published in top management, education and psychology journals, was reviewed around culture and discipline in secondary schools. This systematic literature review (SLR) used several preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and categorised the studies published during the period 2014-2020. Findings The author identified six major themes: (1) punishment, (2) restorative practices (RPs), (3) racial disparities, (4) competitiveness, (5) school climate and (6) secondary school student discipline in a cross-cultural context. Further, the author suggested several future research avenues under these emerging themes. Research limitations/implications The scope of this study is limited to culture and discipline in a secondary school context. The findings provide a solid foundation for researchers in the areas of culture and discipline in secondary schools. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this study can be considered as the first SLR conducted using PRISMA guidelines to identify several under-researched areas in the field of culture and discipline in secondary schools in a cross-cultural context. The study provides several future research insights.

AB  - Background: Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For substrate spawning fish, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. When specific properties of a habitat (e.g., temperature, depth, vegetation composition) are matched to the species' ecological niche, a spawning habitat can be created or enhanced as a means of mitigating or offsetting the harmful effects of human development. Given the acceleration of habitat degradation in aquatic systems as a result of human activity and resultant loss of biodiversity, it is becoming ever more important to consider the effectiveness of the techniques being used to enhance or create habitat, to ensure management resources are being allocated wisely. The primary aim of this systematic review will be to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently being used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate spawning fish in temperate climate regions.
   Methods: This review will examine studies on the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement for substrate spawning fish. We will consider studies in either the North or South temperate climate regions, and include freshwater, estuarine, coastal, or marine environments. Relevant outcomes will include a range of measures used by authors to define effectiveness, including but not limited to the presence of eggs, successful emergence, or improved recruitment. This review will obtain relevant studies from online publication databases, specialist websites, and grey literature using a range of search engines and networking tools. Additional searches will be conducted using the bibliographies of relevant review publications. Study data will be extracted and appraised for quality, including study design, confounding factors, and statistical analysis. A narrative synthesis will be compiled and a meta-analysis will be completed should the data availability and quality allow for it.

AB  - Sense of place is a fundamental aspect of cultural heritage conservation and management, as it plays an important role in understanding the connection between individuals and the places they inhabit. This study aims to provide heritage managers and scholars with upto-date insights into the importance of a sense of place in maintaining cultural heritage. The main objectives of this research are to explore whether a sense of place's role in cultural heritage research has been adequately investigated and to assess the sense of place potential in cultural heritage conservation. We conducted a systematic literature review of 42 articles to achieve these goals. Through thematic analysis, this study reveals a sense of place's impact on various aspects of cultural heritage conservation. From the results, six prominent themes emerged, highlighting that a sense of place is a key determinant in the effectiveness of cultural heritage management initiatives. Based on these findings, authors advocate for enhanced collaboration between the government and local communities, acknowledging the importance of heritage tourism and reinforcing policies for cultural heritage conservation to bolster the sense of place. In future research, examining a sense of place can expand to interdisciplinary intersections, quantitative studies, cross national comparative research, and the exploration of the role of technology in augmenting both the sense of place and cultural heritage conservation.

AB  - Conflict between people and felids is one of the most urgent wild cat conservation issues worldwide, yet efforts to synthesize knowledge about these conflicts have been few. For management strategies to be effective a thorough understanding of the dynamics of human-fetid conflicts is necessary. Here we present the results of a cross-species, systematic review of human-fetid conflicts worldwide. Using a combination of literature review and geographical information system analyses, we provide a quantitative as well as qualitative assessment of patterns and determinants that are known to influence the severity of human-felid conflicts, and a geographical overview of the occurrence of conflict worldwide. We found evidence of conflict affecting over 75% of the world's felid species. The severity of conflict increases with felid body mass and is of greatest conservation significance to nine species: caracal, cheetah, Eurasian lynx, jaguar, leopard, lion, puma, snow leopard and tiger. We also reveal specific gaps in knowledge about human-felid conflicts, and required actions within this aspect of felid conservation. With only 31% of implemented management strategies having been evaluated scientifically, there is a need for greater and more rigorous evaluation and a wider dissemination of results. Also urgently required are standardized reporting techniques to reduce the current disparity in conflict reporting methods and facilitate resolution of patterns and trends in the scale of human-felid conflict worldwide. This review provides a basis both for further synthesis and for the coordination of human-felid conflict management among researchers, practitioners and organizations.

AB  - The illegal wildlife trade is one of the main factors of biodiversity loss worldwide. Brazil, the largest country in South America, is a hub of wildlife trafficking, but availability of information on the issue is constrained to specific regions and to Portuguese speakers. Knowledge gaps hinder the establishment of targeted countermeasures in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. Thousands of animals are seized from IWT and sent to wildlife centers each year. Here, we reviewed the literature on seized songbirds for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), a global hotspot of biodiversity. Using a systematic review approach, we compiled a database with all available papers containing seizure records for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We focused on the 10 most seized species in each study to construct a comprehensive view of the main victims of the illegal trade. We reported 23 studies in 20 locations throughout the BAF. In 19 years, 139,000 passerines were recorded, distributed in 47 species - and two genera - across 10 families. Thraupidae was the most important family, with 27 species in the list and comprising 70% of individuals recorded. We highlighted the preference for granivorous birds and birds deemed good singers. There were few threatened species in the top list, but many of the ones included have population trends of decline, indicating a conservation issue that can direly affect even currently common species if the high demand continues. We appointed knowledge gaps within the Brazilian scenario of wildlife trafficking and provided practical recommendations on the issue considering the global scenario of IWT.

AB  - Background: Chronic cough is a disruptive and exhausting symptom, reported as very distressing in a quarter of those in their last year of life. Existing guidelines for management of chronic cough primarily deal with the commonest benign causes of cough: asthma; eosinophilic bronchitis; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; rhinosinusitis.
   Aim/design: to examine what literature evidence exists and formulate recommendations for managing chronic cough in patients with advanced, progressive, life-limiting illnesses.
   Data sources: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar); hand-search; grey literature.
   Results: Of 11 initially eligible studies, 5 provided evidence at level 2 or better. The small size of these studies, heterogeneity of study population and diversity of interventions and outcome measures used meant that comparison across studies and compilation of guidelines based on high-quality evidence was not possible. Pragmatic recommendations based on available evidence were formulated, drawing on the included studies and, in addition, extrapolating from two other well-designed studies involving patients with chronic cough. They also took into consideration convenience, toxicity and minimizing burden and harm of intervention, as well as considering the potential for disease-directed treatment and the possibility of pharmacological and co-existing benign causes of chronic cough.
   Conclusions: These recommendations (Grade D) include simple linctus, therapeutic trial of sodium cromoglycate and then prescription of an opioid or opioid derivative (dextromethorphan, morphine or codeine). Further research is clearly and urgently required in this area for more effective approaches to managing cough, tested in trials that have sufficient size, power and validity.

AB  - Bushmeat hunting, trade and consumption is a growing biodiversity and food security concern. Much of the collated research is currently limited to forested regions however, despite indications of the increasing threat in savannas Savanna regions are biodiverse and often have high-value wildlife tourism industries, but also have rapidly-growing rural populations, often highly dependent on natural resources. In this systematic quantitative literature review we seek to understand the state of knowledge about bushmeat in savanna regions in Africa. We aim to identify gaps in the literature, both spatially and topically, understand what methodologies are used, what common recommendations are made and what interventions have been quantified. We identified 144 relevant studies from the literature. Although studies have increased over time and diversified thematically, there were strong biases. Most studies were conducted in Tanzania, with gaps in research in southern Africa and the Sahelian region. Additionally, only 25% of papers investigated interventions used to reduce bushmeat hunting, with traditional enforcement being the most common intervention studied (53% of intervention studies, 13% of papers). Other frequently recommended interventions such as alternative incomes received little attention (14% of intervention studies, 3.5% of papers). Further, although many studies cite common drivers of bushmeat hunting such as income or livestock, the evidence for these drivers was lacking and contradictory. We reveal that although bushmeat in savanna regions is gaining recognition, many gaps in knowledge remain. This is the first study to systematically quantify the research about bushmeat in African savannas and aims to inform future research.

AB  - Eutrophication, coupled with loss of herbivory due to habitat degradation and overharvesting, has increased the frequency and severity of macroalgal blooms worldwide. Macroalgal blooms interfere with human activities in coastal areas, and sometimes necessitate costly algal removal programmes. They also have many detrimental effects on marine and estuarine ecosystems, including induction of hypoxia, release of toxic hydrogen sulphide into the sediments and atmosphere, and the loss of ecologically and economically important species. However, macroalgal blooms can also increase habitat complexity, provide organisms with food and shelter, and reduce other problems associated with eutrophication. These contrasting effects make their overall ecological impacts unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall effects of macroalgal blooms on several key measures of ecosystem structure and functioning in marine ecosystems. We also evaluated some of the ecological and methodological factors that might explain the highly variable effects observed in different studies. Averaged across all studies, macroalgal blooms had negative effects on the abundance and species richness of marine organisms, but blooms by different algal taxa had different consequences, ranging from strong negative to strong positive effects. Blooms' effects on species richness also depended on the habitat where they occurred, with the strongest negative effects seen in sandy or muddy subtidal habitats and in the rocky intertidal. Invertebrate communities also appeared to be particularly sensitive to blooms, suffering reductions in their abundance, species richness, and diversity. The total net primary productivity, gross primary productivity, and respiration of benthic ecosystems were higher during macroalgal blooms, but blooms had negative effects on the productivity and respiration of other organisms. These results suggest that, in addition to their direct social and economic costs, macroalgal blooms have ecological effects that may alter their capacity to deliver important ecosystem services.

AB  - Recent advancements in telemetry have redefined our ability to quantify the fine-scale movements of aquatic animals and derive a mechanistic understanding of movement behaviours. The VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) is a fine-scale commercial positioning system used to generate highly accurate semi-continuous animal tracks. To date, VPS has been used to study 86 species, spanning 25 taxonomic orders. It has provided fine-scale movement data for critical life stages, from tracking day-old turtle hatchlings on their first foray into the sea to adult fish returning to natal rivers to spawn. These high-resolution tracking data have improved our understanding of the movements of species across environmental gradients within rivers, estuaries and oceans, including species of conservation concern and commercial value. Existing VPS applications range from quantifying spatio-temporal aspects of animal space use and key aspects of ecology, such as rate of movement and resource use, to higher-order processes such as interactions among individuals and species. Analytical approaches have seen a move towards techniques that incorporate error frameworks such as autocorrelated kernel density estimators for home range calculations. VPS technology has the potential to bridge gaps in our fundamental understanding of fine-scale ecological and physiological processes for single and multi-species studies under natural conditions. Through a systematic review of the VPS literature, we focus on 4 principle topics: the diversity of species studied, current ecological and ecophysiological applications and data analysis techniques, and we highlight future frontiers of exploration.

AB  - Background Care coordination (CC) interventions involve systematic strategies to address fragmentation and enhance continuity of care. However, it remains unclear whether CC can sufficiently address patient needs and improve outcomes. Methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Center, and VA Evidence Synthesis Program, from inception to September 2019. Two individuals reviewed eligibility and rated quality using modified AMSTAR 2. Eligible systematic reviews (SR) examined diverse CC interventions for community-dwelling adults with ambulatory care sensitive conditions and/or at higher risk for acute care. From eligible SR and relevant included primary studies, we abstracted the following: study and intervention characteristics; target population(s); effects on hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and/or patient experience; setting characteristics; and tools and approaches used. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals who implemented CC interventions. Results Of 2324 unique citations, 16 SR were eligible; 14 examined case management or transitional care interventions; and 2 evaluated intensive primary care models. Two SR highlighted selection for specific risk factors as important for effectiveness; one of these also indicated high intensity (e.g., more patient contacts) and/or multidisciplinary plans were key. Most SR found inconsistent effects on reducing hospitalizations or ED visits; few reported on patient experience. Effective interventions were implemented in multiple settings, including rural community hospitals, academic medical centers (in urban settings), and public hospitals serving largely poor, uninsured populations. Primary studies reported variable approaches to improve patient-provider communication, including health coaching and role-playing. SR, primary studies, and key informant interviews did not identify tools for measuring patient trust or care team integration. Sustainability of CC interventions varied and some were adapted over time. Discussion CC interventions have inconsistent effects on reducing hospitalizations and ED visits.

AB  - The increase in the luxury hospitality industry has led to a significant body of new research. Due to some constraints -discussed in detail in this paper-, there is a lack of consensus on the definition and the factors associated with luxury hospitality. This leads to further gaps. To shed some light, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature of 681 articles. Co-occurrence analysis indicates three main topics of research, associated with (1) consumer experience (mainly focused on satisfaction, service quality, and loyalty), (2) sustainability, and (3) recent research on the effects of Covid-19. Regarding the definition, the results show that it varies depending on the perspective taken (e.g., company vs. consumer). Additionally, the theories most frequently used are related to conspicuous consumption and social value. However, recent findings suggest that the hedonic value might be key in some contexts (e.g., seeking escapism), while for some segments (e.g., ultra-high-net -individuals) the functional value might be more important. Finally, the review reveals that new methods need to be applied, such as experimental designs, and research on individual differences (e.g., culture) is still limited. Based on the results, future research recommendations are presented.

AB  - Secondary lead smelters (SLS) represent an environmentally-challenging industry as they deal with toxic substances posing potential threats to both human and environmental health, consequently, they operate under strict government regulations. Such challenges have resulted in the significant reduction of SLS plants in the last three decades. In addition, the domestic recycling of lead has been on a steep decline in the past 10 years as the amount of lead recovered has remained virtually unchanged while consumption has increased. Therefore, one may wonder whether sustainable development can be achieved among SLS. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a roadmap for sustainable development can be established for SLS. The following aims were established in support of the study objective: (1) to conduct a systematic review and an analysis of models of sustainable systems with a particular emphasis on SLS; (2) to document the challenges for the U.S. secondary lead smelting industry; and (3) to explore practices and concepts which act as vehicles for SLS on the road to sustainable development.
   An evidence-based methodology was adopted to achieve the study objective. A comprehensive electronic search was conducted to implement the aforementioned specific aims. Inclusion criteria were established to filter out irrelevant scientific papers and reports. The relevant articles were closely scrutinized and appraised to extract the required information and data for the possible development of a sustainable roadmap. The search process yielded a number of research articles which were utilized in the systematic review. Two types of models emerged: management/business and science/mathematical models. Although the management/business models explored actions to achieve sustainable growth in the industrial enterprise, science/mathematical models attempted to explain the sustainable behaviors and properties aiming at predominantly ecosystem management. As such, there are major disconnects between the science/mathematical and management/business models in terms of aims and goals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate science and business models of sustainability for the industrial enterprises at large and environmentally-challenging industrial sectors in particular. In this paper, we offered examples of practices and concepts which can be used in charting a path towards sustainable development for secondary lead smelters particularly that the waste generated is much greater outside the industrial enterprise than inside.
   An environmentally-challenging industry such as secondary lead smelters requires a fresh look to chart a path towards sustainable development (i.e., survivability and purposive needs) for all stakeholders (i.e., industrial enterprise, individual stakeholders, and social/ecological systems). Such a path should deal with issues beyond pollution prevention, product stewardship and clean technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The authors conducted an integrative review to determine evidence-based and most efficient strategies for improving the palliative care of patients at the end-of-life stage. Thirteen articles that met the overall inclusion criteria were evaluated. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowchart approach was used for the screening process. The Critical Appraisal Skill Program and the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool were also used for the critical appraisal of the data. Full reports of relevant articles were retrieved, and data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently. The quality of studies was appraised in reference to Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. Key aspects included communication and coordination among the team members-patient-centered approach. The major theme was the application of a holistic approach to palliative care consisting of providing comfort to the dying patient. It was identified that relationships, which were identified as spiritual needs, are also crucial to the improvement of palliative care. Improving nursing education in this area, undertaking appropriate curriculum development, and providing coordination among training programs will help knowledgeable health care providers deliver compassionate, affordable, sustainable, and high-quality care to a growing population of aging patients facing the end of their lives.

AB  - The surgical industry makes a major contribution to sustainable healthcare. This article aims to critically evaluate sustainable healthcare to provide quality surgical care in the United Kingdom.
   For this study, a systematic review was conducted using peer-reviewed studies and articles from the United Kingdom related to surgical and anesthetic fields that were published within the last five years. The journal articles were selected based on their relevance to the sustainability and performance of the healthcare system, including risks, and subsequently screened using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 model screening approach. The findings of the relevant journal articles were then critically evaluated for each theme.
   A total of 79 studies were retrieved, and 15 of the retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 10 articles evaluated existing sustainability practices, only seven articles discussed significant determinants of quality healthcare, and only 86.67% of the articles highlighted the implications of sustainability. The key predictors of high-quality medical care are effective resource management, the acquisition of a moral surgical team, the provision of professional services, integration, short hospital stays, and low mortality and morbidity rates. Conserving water, optimizing treatment routes and transportation, and creating cultural change were found to be the pillars of high-quality, sustainable healthcare.
   The concept of sustainability varied between these studies, and limitations on sustainability as a result of reduced mortality, morbidity, and business services were observed. Anesthetic gas emissions from operating rooms continue to have the most detrimental effect on the sustainability of the surgical industry. A significant gap was noted between the available data and their implications.

AB  - Planting flowers along crop field edges is an increasingly common management strategy for addressing pollinator declines and improving crop pollination. However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4-29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery. Determining if field-edge plantings affect pollinator population growth may clarify how plantings improve crop pollination, while further research on landscape context and crop type may define when this happens.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic struck the tourism industry severely. Based on the review of 35 papers that studied the tourism industry in the wake of the pandemic, we propose a resilience-based framework for reviving the global tourism industry post-COVID-19. Our framework outlines four prominent factors for building resilience in the industry: government response, technology innovation, local belongingness, and consumer and employee confidence. We argue that using such inclusive resilience; the tourism industry may transform into a new global economic order characterized by sustainable tourism, society?s well-being, climate action, and the involvement of local communities. We also offer directions for future research in the area.

AB  - The land-sea interface is essential for understanding the interconnectedness of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and provides ecosystem services to people. Although research has been conducted on both ecosystems, knowledge about their interactions remains limited. While there has been growing research interest on land-sea interactions over the last decade, other types of knowledge system such as local or indigenous knowledge have not yet been included. The goal of this study is to review the literature related to land-sea interactions using an ecosystem services framework to help classify existing research. A systematic review of the literature was employed by searching peer-reviewed publications in Web of Science using land-sea interaction keywords. The synthesis identified 166 publications. The findings indicate that the primary disciplines that have investigated land-sea interactions were biogeochemistry and ecology, with a focus on nutrients and interactions. In terms of ecosystem services, supporting and regulating services were the most researched, with urbanization and agricultural and forestry effluents as main studied drivers. Results reveal a need for a more comprehensive view of land-sea interactions that recognizes the critical role that social factors play in shaping the sustainability of these systems. Therefore, a future challenge involves using a more holistic approach to the study and management of land-sea interactions.

AB  - The impacts of changing climate on agriculture have consequences on livelihoods and food security. Smallholder farmers, who have heterogeneous farming systems and limited resources, compounded with multiple risks, are greatly affected. There has been limited research showing how vulnerability assessments have evolved in the smallholder agricultural sector of Africa overtime. This study systematically reviewed recent publications on vulnerability studies, especially among smallholder agricultural systems, to provide an overview of current developments in theory and practice of vulnerability in Africa over the last decade. The findings indicate an increase in vulnerability assessments undertaken across Sub Saharan Africa. Despite progress made in the application of enhanced conceptual frameworks and methods, at least four important gaps exist in the assessment process namely, inadequate engagement of local perspectives and knowledge, lack of clarity in the operationalisation of vulnerability, lack of comprehensiveness of measurement criteria employed and relevance of assessment in decision support. Notwithstanding these challenges, there exist opportunities to geographically improve assessments across Africa. In order to produce knowledge to traverse projected changes in climate systems for agricultural economies and to ensure sustainable smallholder livelihoods, we suggest that future research efforts should be oriented towards providing more information to enlighten science, policy and practice for informed decision-making and evidenced based policies. This requires evaluation of adaptation capacity as a critical aspect of vulnerability assessment to provide guidance and inform effective decision-making on allocation of scarce resources (prioritization); understand trade-offs management and implementation to build understanding among stakeholders that guide possible pathways to reduce vulnerability.

AB  - The human-primate interface is an increasingly relevant theme in primatological research. To understand the extent of ethoprimatological studies in contemporary primatology, we explored 7years of primatological literature through a systematic review. We reviewed original research papers published in the American Journal of Primatology, the International Journal of Primatology, Primates, and Folia Primatologica between January 2010 and December 2016 for the presence of 14 search terms relevant to the ethnoprimatological approach. We sorted research papers into topical categories to identify trends in the recent primatological literature. Of the 1551 papers that met the criteria for inclusion in this review, 12 papers (0.8%) self-identified as an ethnoprimatological study by using the term in the title or keywords, and only 17 papers (1.1%) used the term anywhere in their text. However, the presence of other relevant keywordsanthropogenic (16.3%), crop (9.1%), disturbance (18.7%), conflict (6.2%), human-nonhuman (0.5%), human-primate (1.0%), interface (1.5%), perception (2.5%), culture (2.6%), ethnography (0.1%), trade (6.8%), provision (16.1%), and tourism (4.6%)in a variety of research papers suggests that the human-primate dimension is salient for many, if not most, areas of primatological interest. The ethnoprimatological approach is relevant to every research trend we identified in today's primatology. We highlight existing literature that exemplifies ethnoprimatological engagement and present potential research questions in each area, demonstrating that primatology as a whole would benefit from greater attention to the human dimension.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to assess if serious games impact health outcomes for children less than 18 years of age with chronic diseases. Additionally, the impact of self-efficacy, adherence, knowledge, use of theory, parent involvement, and study quality was also examined.
   Materials and Methods: Searches were conducted in databases EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science between June and August 2016. Randomized controlled trials using a serious game as an intervention, for participants under 18 years of age, to improve their chronic disease were included.
   Results: Data were extracted by two independent researchers, including: Title, author, and publication year; chronic disease; game description; number and age of participants; intervention duration; significant findings; parent involvement; theory; and study quality. Any disagreements were tackled and consensus was achieved. Eighteen studies were included in the review. The areas of health addressed included cerebral palsy, asthma, diabetes, developmental coordination disorders, and vision disorders. In these articles, eight health outcome variables were measured, including: lung function, glycemic control, hospital visits, motor proficiency, and visual acuity. Psychosocial variables that were assessed included self-efficacy and knowledge. Two articles included parents in the intervention, and three articles used theory. Six studies had significant health outcome finding, and four studies found a significant change in one psychosocial variable.
   Conclusion: This review demonstrates the potential for games to improve health outcomes of young individuals. However, the mixed results suggest that more serious game interventions need to be better designed and rigorously tested to support their impact on improving health outcomes.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The aim of the review was to explore patient and family caregiver perspectives on key issues for ensuring quality of end-of-life care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The growing evidence on the value of specialist palliative care services demonstrates significant improvements in treatments and provisions; however, much of the literature is generic in nature or centred on people with a cancer diagnosis. In this review, we examine the literature to ascertain the views and needs of patients and carers affected by advanced COPD, a highly debilitating condition that can have a profoundly negative impact on the quality of end-of-life experience.
   Recent findings
   A total of 19 papers were included in the review. The main themes in the literature were Holistic Care, Illness Trajectory and Technology.
   Summary
   Areas of unmet need emphasized across physical, psychosocial and spiritual domains were identified, particularly in relation to appropriate and timely conversations. Positive developments in the care and treatment of advanced COPD include the use of the STIOLTO Respimat inhaler, a brief educative and psychosocial intervention based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, and high-intensity exercise training. There is some evidence regarding the use of technology in end-stage COPD.

AB  - Countries affected by conflict often experience the deterioration of health system infrastructure and weaken service delivery. Evidence suggests that healthcare services that leverage local community dynamics may ameliorate health system-related challenges; however, little is known about implementing these interventions in contexts where formal delivery of care is hampered subsequent to conflict. We reviewed the evidence on community health worker (CHW)-delivered healthcare in conflict-affected settings and synthesized reported information on the effectiveness of interventions and characteristics of care delivery. We conducted a systematic review of studies in OVID MedLine, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL) and Google Scholar databases. Included studies (1) described a context that is post-conflict, conflict-affected or impacted by war or crisis; (2) examined the delivery of healthcare by CHWs in the community; (3) reported a specific outcome connected to CHWs or community-based healthcare; (4) were available in English, Spanish or French and (5) were published between 1 January 2000 and 6 May 2021. We identified 1976 articles, of which 55 met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen countries were represented, and five categories of disease were assessed. Evidence suggests that CHW interventions not only may be effective but also efficient in circumventing the barriers associated with access to care in conflict-affected areas. CHWs may leverage their physical proximity and social connection to the community they serve to improve care by facilitating access to care, strengthening disease detection and improving adherence to care. Specifically, case management (e.g. integrated community case management) was documented to be effective in improving a wide range of health outcomes and should be considered as a strategy to reduce barrier to access in hard-to-reach areas. Furthermore, task-sharing strategies have been emphasized as a common mechanism for incorporating CHWs into health systems.

AB  - Parent-mediated intervention is a prominent approach to supplementing service insufficiency for the population with autism spectrum disorder, yet individuals from low-resource areas are largely under-represented among participants in the global parent-mediated intervention research. This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to inspect the overall effects and research quality of parent-mediated interventions in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. A total of 21 parent-mediated interventions were included in systematic review, and among them, 12 randomized controlled trials representing 964 children were analyzed in meta-synthesis. Overall, results of meta-analysis showed favorable effects of parent-mediated interventions with standardized mean difference ranging from 0.63 (social competence) to 1.00 (symptom severity) and averaged 0.76 across domains. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor evidence quality as assessed in GRADE ratings. In terms of methodological quality, QualSyst evaluation showed that more than half (14/21) of the included studies were below satisfactory. Identified programs lack the capacity to be further disseminated in the Chinese societies due to the absence of solid theoretical foundations, the negligence of implementation outcomes, and the inadequacy of sophisticated cultural adaptations. This review reinforces the need for promotion and improvement of parent-mediated interventions in low-resource context (PROSPERO: CRD42019138723). Lay abstract The ideal dosage for early intensive interventions for autism spectrum disorder has been suggested to be at least 25-hour per week to reach optimal effects. However, insufficient service use and unmet needs among families with children with autism spectrum disorder are frequently reported worldwide. Helping parents to develop strategies for interaction and management of behavior through parent training has been demonstrated to be a prominent way to supplementing service insufficiency for autism spectrum disorder, which is particularly crucial in less-resourced areas. This review included 21 parent-mediated intervention programs conducted in China, the most populated developing country. Among them, we were able to combine outcome information from 12 randomized controlled trials to increase confidence in the results. We also rated the quality of methodology and evidence for all included studies, which was taken into account in making conclusions. The included programs varied in the content, length, and delivery method of trainings. Although targeting different training outcomes, the majority of the studies aimed to help parents be more competent and responsive during interactions with their child in order to decrease symptom severity. Overall, results showed sufficient evidence that parent training did improve child outcomes as intended. However, the quality of more than half (14/21) of the included studies were below satisfactory. Identified programs lack the capacity to be further transported in the Chinese societies due to the lack of solid theoretical foundations, implementation manuals, and appropriate cultural adaptations. This review reinforces the need for promotion and improvement of parent-mediated interventions in low-resource context.

AB  - The challenge of sustainable development and consumption is to meet current wants without impoverishing future generations and the planet in the long term. Therefore, new patterns of sustainable practices are increasingly promoted. The purpose of the present study is to realize a systematic review aimed to analyze the contents and features of articles dealing with new trends in consumers' sustainable consumption. One hundred and four papers published in the last five years were retrieved and analyzed through a lexicographical analysis using the software T-LAB. The results show that, even if most of the current studies focus almost exclusively on the environmental impact of sustainability, the social perspective is also recently taking hold. Evidence suggests prevailing attention towards consumers' appeal and consumption of eco-friendly food products, together with a growing interest in the last years in consumers' practices in other key sectors, such as tourism, commerce, and clothing. Future research should spotlight the less explored frameworks, looking at the economic and social sides of sustainability in a variety of contextual settings. At the same time, consumer-focused research should not forget to look at consumers' sustainable behavior as a whole and its impacts from the perspective of planet, people, and profit.

AB  - Introduction: Successful recruitment of participants into clinical research has always been challenging and is affected by many factors. This systematic review aimed to explore the perceptions and attitudes as well as identify the factors affecting the participation in clinical research among the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office countries' population. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted to explore attitudes or perceptions of the general public or patients towards participation in clinical research. PubMed, Pro-Quest Central, World Health Organizations Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Google Scholar were searched. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they presented primary data and were conducted in one of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office countries. A data extraction sheet was used to record the following: year, country, aim, population, sample size, study design, data collection, and setting. The identified factors from the included studies were categorized into motivators and barriers. Results: In total, 23 original research articles were identified that addressed perceptions or attitudes towards clinical research participation. Six main motivators and barriers of research participation among patients, the general public, and patient family members were identified. The most common cited motivators included personal benefits to the individual, altruism and the desire to help others, the research process, the influence of the physician, family encouragement, and religion. Concerns regarding safety, confidentiality, and other factors in addition to the research process, lack of trust in healthcare providers or healthcare system, lack of interest in research and no perceived personal benefit, religious concerns, and family/cultural concerns were the most cited barriers to participation. Conclusion: The identified motivators and barriers are essential to tackle during clinical research planning among the population of Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office countries. Further research is needed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of individuals approached to participate in trials.

KW  - qualitative study
AB  - The transition of China's railways from aggressive expansion to sustainable development has sparked widespread discussions on green railways. Previous studies have primarily focused on the fundamental aspects of green rail design and construction. However, the green operation phase, one of the most critical stages in the entire lifecycle of railways, has been overlooked. This study used a mixed-method approach, combining systematic review and qualitative analysis, to identify significant environmental, economic, and social evaluation indicators for green railway transportation operations. Through an examination of 123 articles and interviews with four professors in academia, two Planning and Design Institute technicians, one government staff, and one railway practitioner, this study identified 17 key indicators associated with green operations in railways. The results showed that previous studies in the environmental aspect primarily focused on noise pollution, water pollution, solid waste, ecological conservation, and the use of construction materials. In the social part, the main concern is social equality. Green railway operations have the potential to impact social equity through the movement of people and goods, which makes accessibility a preferable evaluation measure. Regarding economic indicators, the influencing factors are more complex (such as regional GDP per capita), making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of green railway operations directly. We suggest the inclusion of more economic-related indicators that directly correlate with green operations in railways.

AB  - Despite expanding interest in ecosystem service research over the past three decades, in-depth understanding of the contribution of forests and trees to food production and livelihoods remains limited. This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.

AB  - The integration of ecosystem service (ES) knowledge into decision-making processes is increasingly endorsed by various policies and initiatives, with spatial planning targeted as one of the most relevant fields. Learning and feeding back from existing experiences is therefore a fundamental step to ensure appropriate and useful support by ES science. This paper aims to gather and critically analyse how ES science contributes to spatial planning practices. Through a systematic review of the literature about ES use in spatial planning, we map the level of integration of ES knowledge, the scale of case studies, and the type of planning addressed; and we identify and analyse case studies of real-world applications. Studies explicitly aimed at supporting spatial planning have increased over the last decade, but are still scarce. The real-world case studies reveal advantages of integrating ES knowledge into spatial planning processes, mainly concerning practical aspects such as synthesizing complex socio-environmental information and promoting participation. Windows of opportunity offered by regulatory frameworks and innovative processes and instruments, such as marine spatial plans and strategic environmental assessments, are key factors triggering the integration. However, supportive contextual conditions are necessary, including science-policy collaborations across the entire planning process and environmental awareness among policy-makers and stakeholders.

AB  - Artificial reefs (ARs) have been used on coral reefs for ecological research, conservation, and socio-cultural purposes since the 1980s. We examined spatio-temporal patterns in AR deployment in tropical and subtropical coral reefs (up to 35 degrees latitude) and evaluated their efficacy in meeting conservation objectives, using a systematic review of the scientific literature. Most deployments (136 studies) were in the North Atlantic and Central Indo-Pacific in 1980s - 2000s, with a pronounced shift to the Western Indo-Pacific in 2010s. Use of ARs in reef restoration or stressor mitigation increased markedly in response to accelerating coral decline over the last 2 decades. Studies that evaluated success in meeting conservation objectives (n = 51) commonly reported increasing fish abundance (55%), enhancing habitat quantity (31%) or coral cover (27%), and conserving target species (24%). Other objectives included stressor mitigation (22%), provision of coral nursery habitat (14%) or source populations (2%) and addressing socio-cultural and economic values (16%). Fish (55% of studies) and coral (53%) were the most commonly monitored taxa. Success in achieving conservation objectives was reported in 33 studies. Success rates were highest for provision of nursery habitat and increasing coral cover (each 71%). Increasing fish abundance or habitat quantity, mitigating environmental impacts, and attaining socio-cultural objectives were moderately successful (60-64%); conservation of target species was the least successful (42%). Failure in achieving objectives commonly was attributed to poor AR design or disruption by large-scale bleaching events. The scale of ARs generally was too small (m(2) - 10s m(2)) to address regional losses in coral cover, and study duration too short (< 5 years) to adequately assess ecologically relevant trends in coral cover and community composition. ARs are mostly likely to aid in reef conservation and restoration by providing nursery habitat for target species or recruitment substrate for corals and other organisms. Promoting local socio-cultural values also has potential for regional or global impact by increasing awareness of coral reef decline, if prioritized and properly monitored.

AB  - Background Multimorbidity, increasing numbers of chronically ill patients and demographic change are leading to increased care costs in Germany with an increasing shortage of staff in skilled nursing and geriatric care. In this context, more and more caregivers with a migration background of the 1st generation (PmMH) are being recruited and integrated into existing (corporate) cultures. This represents an important starting point for a permanent and needs-based supply landscape.The aim of the study The aim of the study was to identify and analyze the specific stresses of PmMH at the workplace in nursing and geriatric careMaterial and Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in relevant specialist databases (Pubmed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane), supplemented by an extended snowball and hand search. This was followed by a descriptive presentation of the results of the study content, which in a subsequent step was iteratively brought together and consolidated into thematic categories by several people.Results A total of 15 publications were identified as relevant and included in the analysis. Specific, migration-associated stress factors could be identified. In particular, the categories: "Discrimination and racism ", "Language and communication problems " and "Cultural adjustment " characterized the (collaborative) work in nursing and care for the elderly and led to additional stress for employees and patients.Discussion The present review article identified and summarized specific burdens of PmMH. At this point it can be assumed that these affect both PmMH and patients. So far, operational concepts do not seem to be able to adequately solve the challenges, so that effective, sustainable approaches have to be found. The extent to which the specificed stress factors only affect PmMH is not considered in this context, so that further research is needed.

AB  - Simple Summary Populations of many marine species are threatened by a number of interacting factors, including anthropogenic activities, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The assessment of the conservation status of such populations relies heavily on several types of data, such as large-scale geographical and ecological distribution. Seahorses are charismatic fish sensitive to environmental pressures, and according to the IUCN directive 95/2020, they should be considered a model for environmental quality assessment. As in many other areas, the data on seahorse ecological distribution in Europe are scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect gaps, and propose future research priorities. We analyzed 32 years of published studies and described the distribution of Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus across 176 sites in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea as a function of habitat, depth, and degree of confinement. The applied method evidenced the overall lack of a detailed habitat description in published studies. Seahorse conservation would benefit from an analytical description of habitats, such as data on the depth, nature of the substrate, and associated biological communities, as well as the use of a standardized habitat classification system, such as formally recognized EUNIS habitat codes. Human pressures on marine ecosystems have caused extensive degradation of marine habitats and several local extinctions. Overexploitation and destructive fishing practices are responsible for biodiversity loss in many coastal ecosystems. The definition of conservation programs in marine fish requires comprehensive knowledge on large-scale geographical distribution, while considering distribution/abundance patterns in relation to key environmental variables. Due to their life-cycle traits, the two European seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus), as with other congeneric species, are particularly sensitive to the effects of anthropogenic activities and habitat changes. However, information on the ecological distribution of these two species is scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. In this paper, we followed an international standard protocol for systematic reviews (the PRISMA protocol) to provide a detailed assessment of the two species' geographical distribution in relation to the environmental characteristics. According to the 134 analyzed studies, Hippocampus guttulatus is more common in confined areas, while H. hippocampus is found in marine shelf waters. With several interspecific differences, seagrasses were the most used holdfasts of both species. The EUNIS codes (European nature information system) referring to a specific and unique habitat were discussed as a potential tool for defining the ecological distribution of the two species. The obtained results and their future implementation could help plan conservation actions.

AB  - The need to improve the sustainability of intensive livestock farming has led to an increasing adoption of Building Energy Simulation (BES) models for livestock houses. However, a consolidated body of knowledge specifically dedicated to these models is lacking in literature. This gap represents a significant obstacle to their widespread application and scalability in research and industry. The aim of this work is to pave the way for scaling the adoption of BES models for livestock houses by providing a comprehensive analysis of their application, development, and validation. For this aim, a systematic review of 42 papers-selected from over 795 results from the initial database query-is carried out. The findings underscored a growing body of research that involves BES models for different purposes. However, a common approach in both model development and validation is still lacking. This issue could hinder their scalability as a standard practice, especially in industry, also considering the limitations of BES models highlighted in this work. This review could represent a solid background for future research since provides an up-to-date framework on BES models for livestock houses and identifies future research opportunities. Moreover, it contributes to increasing the reliability of BES models for livestock houses by providing some recommendations for their validation.

AB  - Background. Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal condition in the general population. Passive physical modalities are commonly used to treat shoulder pain. However, previous systematic reviews reported conflicting results.
   Purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of passive physical modalities for the management of soft tissue injuries of the shoulder.
   Data Sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 1990, to April 18, 2013.
   Study Selection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort and casecontrol studies were eligible. Random pairs of independent reviewers screened 1,470 of 1,760 retrieved articles after removing 290 duplicates. Twenty-two articles were eligible for critical appraisal. Eligible studies were critically appraised using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Of those, 11 studies had a low risk of bias.
   Data Extraction. The lead author extracted data from low risk 'of bias studies and built evidence tables. A second reviewer independently checked the extracted data.
   Data Synthesis. The findings of studies with a low risk of bias were synthesized according to principles of best evidence synthesis. Pretensioned tape, ultrasound, and interferential current were found to be noneffective for managing shoulder pain. However, diathermy and corticosteroid injections led to similar outcomes. Low-level laser therapy provided short-term pain reduction for subacromial impingement syndrome. Extracorporeal shock-wave therapy was not effective for subacromial impingement syndrome but provided benefits for persistent shoulder calcific tendinitis.
   Limitations. Non-English studies were excluded.
   Conclusions. Most passive physical modalities do not benefit patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. However, low-level laser therapy is more effective than placebo or ultrasound for subacromial impingement syndrome. Similarly, shockwave therapy is more effective than sham therapy for persistent shoulder calcific techniques.

AB  - Sustainable intensification (SI) is a necessary approach to overcome the contradictions between food demands and resource and environmental constraints. We reviewed 2,475 papers on the topic 'Sustainable Intensification,' from Web of Science (WOS), with the help of visualizations drawn by CiteSpace and Biblioshiny. The objectives are: (i) to clarify the concept and connotations of SI, and (ii) to draw conclusions on the current situation, hotspots, and trends in SI research. The results show that: (1) Although SI has become one of the most frequently and widely used terms, its precise definition needs to be defined. (2) The number of papers on the topic of SI has been increasing, especially in the last five years. (3) A group of core authors, a representative journal cluster, and a cooperative research network have all been established. (4) Arable agriculture is the main field of SI research.

AB  - Objective: Previous research has provided an inconsistent message as to the effectiveness of multidisciplinary programs to improve employment outcomes in clients with Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP). The primary aims of this review were to: 1) update the evidence for the multidisciplinary treatment of CLBP to improve employment outcomes 2) assess what knowledge supports occupational therapy as contributing to a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of CLBP.
   Participants: Working-age adults experiencing CLBP who took part in controlled trials evaluating multidisciplinary programs between July 1998 and July 2009.
   Methods: Updated guidelines provided by the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group (BRG) were used to perform a systematic review to identify, appraise, and synthesize research evidence relevant to our research questions.
   Results: Twelve unique articles were found, after a database search and citation tracking, only two of which were high quality. Our findings suggest that there is still conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary programs to improve employment outcomes in CLBP.
   Conclusions: The results are discussed with reference to current methodological limitations found in the literature. Furthermore, occupational therapists were found to be underutilized in the included studies and future multidisciplinary programs should take advantage of the wide range of skills that occupational therapists can contribute in this practice area.

AB  - Sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 are geared toward sustainable development through various pathways, one being reducing inequality as covered in SDG 10. Inequalities are a threat to health and wellbeing of populations and a planet Earth in which we live. This rapid review aims to identify key issues that are likely to exacerbate inequalities around the six SDGs directly related to One Health, which are SDG 3, 6, 11, 13, 14 and 15, and suggest some actions that may help to address them using inclusive governance taking into account the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Informed by the literature on SDGs and using the "inclusive development concept" by Gupta and Vegelin, literature search was done in Google Scholar, PubMed Central, as well as, searching of references in the relevant articles identified using search terms from the six SDGs that are directly related to One Health. In the context of the SDGs, in order to achieve One Health through inclusive governance, and tackle inequalities, the following needs to be considered and addressed: increasing number of armed conflicts; ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; ensuring availability of water and sanitation facilities; improving city and urban areas planning to cope with climate change; improving governance arrangements for addressing climate change factoring gender and human rights; multisectoral planning for conservation of oceans, seas, and marine resources; balancing trade regulation of wildlife trade with conservation efforts; need for a research collaborative involving experts from environmental sciences, wildlife, agriculture and human health to study and develop scientific evidence on contribution of changes in land use practices to occurrence of zoonotic diseases; and need of a legislation for promoting animal welfare to protect public health. Also, inclusion of people with disabilities in the use of digital technologies is critical.

AB  - Seabird species world-wide are integral to both marine and terrestrial environments, connecting the two systems by transporting vast quantities of marine-derived nutrients and pollutants to terrestrial breeding, roosting and nesting grounds via the deposition of guano and other allochthonous inputs (e.g. eggs, feathers). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide insight into what types of nutrients and pollutants seabirds are transporting, the influence these subsidies are having on recipient environments, with a particular focus on soil, and what may happen if seabird populations decline. The addition of guano to colony soils increased nutrient levels compared to control soils for all seabirds studied, with cascading positive effects observed across a range of habitats. Deposited guano sometimes led to negative impacts, such as guanotrophication, or guano-induced eutrophication, which was often observed where there was an excess of guano or in areas with high seabird densities. While the literature describing nutrients transported by seabirds is extensive, literature regarding pollutant transfer is comparatively limited, with a focus on toxic and bioaccumulative metals. Research on persistent organic pollutants and plastics transported by seabirds is likely to increase in coming years. Studies were limited geographically, with hotspots of research activity in a few locations, but data were lacking from large regions around the world. Studies were also limited to seabird species listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As seabird populations are impacted by multiple threats and steep declines have been observed for many species world-wide, gaps in the literature are particularly concerning. The loss of seabirds will impact nutrient cycling at localized levels and potentially on a global scale as well, yet it is unknown what may truly happen to areas that rely on seabirds if these populations disappear.

AB  - The prevailing global environmental distress, particularly in rural areas, calls for the adoption of integrated sustainable rural development strategies like climate-smart agroforestry (CSA) practices. CSAF is a new name for an old farming practice among the world's traditional farmers, a holistic approach to land use in which trees, crops, and sometimes animals are combined within a managed farmland, a sustainable farming system and practice, and a pathway toward the mitigation and adaptation of the biggest challenge of our times: climate change. CSAF systems and practices provide a range of goods and services vital for human well-being, particularly for people who live below the poverty line. Yet a number of important knowledge, research, and adoption gaps remain regarding human-environment interactions, and the urgency behind these gaps reflects the need to inform evidence-based policymaking and practice to realize the potential for CSAF to support farmers' livelihoods. We conducted a review of CSAF system practices that contribute to achieving the SDGs, in particular those related to increased human well-being, and prosperity, soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change response, biodiversity conservation, and landscape management, from the SDGs outlook. The study specifically identifies, (i) what has been innovatively achieved in CSAF practices to cope with climate risks for environmental stability, improved farm productivity, farm income, and food security (what works), (ii) challenges facing smallholder farmers to adopt CSAF practices (what doesn't work), and (iii) room for a significant contribution of CSAF practices in smallholder farmers' productivity beyond what has been observed. Generally, the results show that CSAF practices have the potential to optimize different socio-economic returns and sustain environmental services. Farming with CSAF technologies has many advantages in both ecological and economic aspects that support the achievement of several of the SDGs, specifically SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG5 (gender equality), SDG6 (clean water and proper sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG13 (climate action), and SDG15 (life on land). Results showed that despite its contribution to the SDGs and its global widespread, the challenge remains linking knowledge and action in CSAF research, education, and capacity development. Farmers will not be able to solve the challenge of sustainable agriculture by themselves. Thus, efforts are required from both the public and the industry and effective public-private partnerships along the agricultural and food value chain. There are multidimensional aspects to CSAF which require in-depth scientific analysis for the extensive application of CSAF practices in sustainable land management endeavors. Moreover, in this perspective, CSAF should keep its identity while seeking a role in the nexus of SDGs. We hope this review will provide a clearer picture of what the state-of-the-art in practicing smarter technologies in a changing climate is and provide a more holistic understanding of CSAF systems and practices, and the gaps regarding human-environment interactions, and the way forward to overcoming them.

AB  - This paper aims to explain the administrative and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) of the Indonesian Spaceport Project in Biak, Papua, Indonesia, under the Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) scheme, particularly from the protest to fear of environmental damage and traditional rights. This paper analyzes the factors that cause the local society's reluctance to accept the development of Indonesia's very first commercial spaceport. This paper uses a doctrinal methodology, which examines changes in the trend of ESG in implementing PPP projects. The method used is a qualitative systematic review of national and international studies. This paper finds that the lack of legal certainty for administrative and ESG as the main factor contributing to the pitfall of the PPP project in Biak Papua. No clear Government Contracting Agency (GCA), plus the fact that the Indonesian government puts too much weight on business consideration in PPP while Papuan people need more ESG, especially considering the historical conflict in the region, has been the epicenter of the problem. Given the ESG-PPP regulatory failure of spaceport development in Biak, more focused studies using comparative study methodology are needed to propose a more robust and customized ESG in PPP regulations in a politically and historically sensitive area. The authors forward a regulatory reform to balance administration, ESG, and business considerations in PPP projects for a spaceport.

AB  - Some bumble bee species are in decline globally. Declines have been attributed to many factors including habitat loss. Habitat is an integral component of any species and should be a central focus of conservation efforts to protect at risk species. However, the habitat of bumble bee species is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature using Web of Science to summarize articles that have described the habitat of bumble bee species. In total, 55 nesting and 10 overwintering habitat studies are described in this review. We described common patterns associated with bumble bee studies including overwintering habitat, landscape type, and ground position. We found that bumble bee nests are more frequently found underground and that studies were biased towards the United Kingdom and agricultural habitats. There are some preferences in nesting and overwintering habitat, but further research is needed to draw any substantial conclusions. Detection of nesting and overwintering site studies may be improved using citizen science initiatives and possibly through employing detection dogs or radio-telemetry. Increasing the detection of nesting and overwintering sites is an important priority to improve our understanding of bumble bee habitat. It is critical that we identify all aspects of bumble bee habitat to ensure the protection, restoration and creation of important resources to ensure their conservation.

AB  - Despite the promise of new gene editing technologies (GETs) (e.g., CRISPR) in accelerating sustainable agri-food production, the social acceptability of these technologies remains unclear. Prior literature has primarily addressed the regulatory and economic issues impacting GETs ongoing acceptability, while little work has examined socio-cultural impacts despite evolving food policies and product commercialisation demanding input from various actors in the food system. Our systematic review across four databases addresses this gap by synthesising recent research on food system actors' perspectives to identify the key socio-cultural factors influencing GET acceptability. This review extends prior literature by including views from a more diverse range of actors (e.g., farmers and NGOs) and provides a better understanding of their perceived social benefits and concerns. We find food system actors perceive positive and negative impacts of using GETs in agriculture. These perspectives are often entangled in broader debates regarding sustainability and food systems issues (e.g., social justice). We discuss practical recommendations for policymakers, agri-food industry managers, and scientists to better align gene edited foods (GEFs) with food system actors' values. GEF policy, development, and commercialisation must reflect social values such as collective wellbeing and transparency to improve actors' acceptability. More research is required among marginalised food actors such as Indigenous and smallholder farmers.

AB  - Reef environments are rapidly transforming worldwide, and these changes are causing major impacts to the reef ecosystem. Scientific knowledge is strategic for marine conservation and management in these scenarios. Aiming to contribute to this subject, a systematic review from 1967 to 2020 was conducted, in order to identify gaps in studies regarding reef fish species, ecosystem components and processes. Multidisciplinary sciences concerning reef fish have been rising, mainly in the fields of basic biology and ecology. Besides that, phase shifts and ecosystem services were absent terms in the analyzes of co-occurrence. Research in the ethnosciences needs to be increased, and will improve access to local ecological knowledge, which can be used as a tool to address issues in reef environments. Socio-ecological systems are components of this landscape that has had few publications. The participation in the elaboration of public policies can be a new avenue to foster the biodiversity of reef environments.

AB  - There is no doubt that since the last decade, as the focus towards sustainability has grown significantly in the supply chain field, many empirical and conceptual papers have been published in journals. This study aims to investigate the present and emerging trends in the field of SSCM (sustainable supply chain management), meanwhile exploring future research directions. This article conducts the meta-analysis and systematic review of 362 research papers published in the well known peer-reviewed journals in the last sixteen years (2004-2019). The present study structured the reviewed literature with the following categories: drivers and barriers of the sustainable supply chain, adopted multi-criteria-decision-making techniques, year-wise number of research papers, names of journals and publishers, and classification of articles based on research design and method. This study draws an up-to-date picture of the recent developments, emerging trends, and gaps for future studies in the field of SSCM. The finding shows that the area has dominated by MCDM (Multiple-criteria decision making) based research methods and firms-level studies. Furthermore, researchers need to employ efficient algorithms and advanced economic modelling and conduct studies on the macro-level (country, and region-levels) to explore new linkages.

AB  - PURPOSE Access to health care is a long-standing concern for rural patients; however, administrative measures fail to capture the subjective patient experience of accessing health care. The purpose of this review was to synthesize the qualitative literature on patient and caregiver experiences of accessing health care services for chronic disease management among US residents of rural areas.
   METHODS We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus to identify qualitative studies published during 2010-2019. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyze findings from included studies.
   RESULTS A total of 62 studies involving 1,354 unique participants were included. The largest share of studies (24.2%) was focused on the experience of patients with cancer, followed by behavioral health (16.1%), HIV and AIDS (14.5%), and diabetes (12.9%). We identified 4 primary analytic themes of barriers and facilitators associated with the experience of accessing health care services for chronic disease management in rural areas: (1) navigating the rural environment, (2) navigating the health care system, (3) financing chronic disease management, and (4) rural life (ie, common elements of a distinct "rural" way of thinking and behaving).
   CONCLUSIONS In this comprehensive review, we found that important cultural, structural, and individual factors influenced the rural patient's experience of health care access and use, including barriers and facilitators posed by geographic and built environments, and distinct rural mores. Our findings can inform policies and programs that both facilitate structural aspects of access and include culturally appropriate interventions.

AB  - In order to understand the impact of individual communities on global sustainability, we need a community sustainability assessment system (CSAS). While many sustainability assessment systems exist, they prove inadequate to the task. This article presents the results of a systematic review of the literature on existing sustainability assessment systems; offers a definition of a sustainable community; provides a multi-scale, systems approach to thinking about community; and makes recommendations from the field of performance measurement for the construction of a CSAS.

AB  - Background
   Chronic wounds affect an estimated 2.21 per 1000 population. They are a significant source of morbidity and affect individuals physically, psychologically, socially and financially. Person centered care is one approach to improve patient outcomes in wound care as it values patients' perspectives, beliefs and autonomy and considers the person as a whole within the cultural context in which care is provided.
   Aim
   We aimed to review the evidence on the use of person-centered care (PCC) in chronic wound care management and provide reconunendations for practice and future research.
   Method
   Using a systematic review methodology, we searched six databases for full-text papers from 2009-2019 published in peer-reviewed journals with no limits on language.
   Results
   Eighteen articles on studies involving 3149 patients from nine countries were identified. Studies were conducted under three broad intervention categories: healthcare professional education (n=1); patient education (n=14) and telemedicine (n=3). Studies were equally focused on prevention and treatment of chronic wounds. Significant improvements were reported in patient knowledge, pain and self-care behaviours. Only two studies evaluated the impact on wound healing and one study estimated the cost of implementing person-centered care.
   Conclusions
   The evidence base to support FCC in wound management is developing and based on our review has shown improved outcomes in areas of pressure ulcer prevention, patient satisfaction, patient knowledge and quality of life, but clinical outcomes such as wound healing were less well explored. Further research with more objective outcome measures are required

AB  - The capacity of forests to recover after disturbance, i.e., their resilience, determines their ability to persist and function over time. Many variables, natural and managerial, affect forest resilience. Thus, understanding their effects is critical for the development of sound forest conservation and management strategies, especially in the context of ongoing global environmental changes. We conducted a representative review, meta-analysis, of the forest literature in this topic (search terms "forest AND resilience"). We aimed to identify natural conditions that promote or jeopardize resilience, assess the efficacy of post-disturbance management practices on forest recovery, and evaluate forest resilience under current environmental changes.
   We surveyed more than 2,500 articles and selected the 156 studies (724 observations) that compared and quantified forest recovery after disturbance under different contexts. Context of recovery included: resource gradients (moisture and fertility), post-disturbance biomass reduction treatments, species richness gradients, incidence of a second disturbance, and disturbance severity. Metrics of recovery varied from individual tree growth and reproduction, to population abundance, to species richness and cover. Analyses show management practices only favored recovery through increased reproduction (seed production) and abundance of recruitment stages. Higher moisture conditions favored recovery, particularly in dry temperate regions; and in boreal forests, this positive effect increased with regional humidity. Biomass reduction treatments were only effective in increasing resilience after a drought. Early recruiting plant stages benefited from increased severity, while disturbance severity was associated with lower recovery of remaining adult trees. This quantitative review provides insight into the natural conditions and management practices under which forest resilience is enhanced and highlights conditions that could jeopardize future resilience. We also identified important knowledge gaps, such as the role of diversity in determining forest resilience and the lack of data in many regions.

AB  - Health and safety education for farmers has the potential to increase the level of health, safety literacy, and thereby improve farmers' health and quality of life. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the published literature documenting different educational interventions for agricultural workers that have the improvement of health and/or safety literacy as an outcome. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus and PsycINFO databases for articles focusing on educational interventions for farmers' health and safety. From the 3357 initial hits, 36 unduplicated records met the inclusion criteria. The articles included in the review used educational interventions for farmers with the purpose of preventing farm-induced diseases and injuries, increasing the health and well-being of farmers, and promoting good manufacturing practices. The educational approaches considered varied from lectures, videos, newsletters, games, and community fairs, to involving the community in designing the intervention and training farmers to deliver the intervention to the community. Interventions that used evidence-based theories, which took into account cultural aspects and individual factors, used biomarkers as a behavior change measurement, and involved the community in the development of the intervention had the best results in terms of behavior change. The strategies of educational interventions identified in this review that produced good results have the potential to inform future researchers and policy makers in the design and implementation of public health interventions, programs and policies to improve the health of farmers and their families.

AB  - Background: Regular monitoring of HIV patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is required to ensure patient benefits and the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of ART programs. Prompted by WHO recommendations for expansion and decentralization of HIV treatment and care in low and middle income countries, we conducted a systematic review to assess the feasibility of treatment monitoring in these settings.
   Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed using a combination of MeSH and free text terms relevant to HIV treatment and care, health service delivery, health service accessibility, decentralization and other relevant terms. Five electronic databases and two conference websites were searched to identify relevant studies conducted in LMICs, published in English between Jan 2006 and Dec 2015. Outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients who received treatment monitoring and health system factors related to monitoring of patients on ART under decentralized HIV service delivery models.
   Results: From 5363 records retrieved, twenty studies were included in the review; all but one was conducted in sub-Saharan African countries. The majority of studies (15/20) had relatively short follow-up duration (<= 24 months), and only two studies were specifically designed to assess treatment monitoring practices. The most frequently studied follow-up period was 12 months and a wide range of treatment monitoring coverage was observed. The reported proportions of patients on ART who received CD4 monitoring ranged from very low (6%; N = 2145) to very high (95%; N = 488). The median uptake of viral load monitoring was 86% with studies in program settings reporting coverage as low as 14%. Overall, the longer the follow-up period, the lower the proportion of patients who received regular monitoring tests; and programs in rural areas reported low coverage of laboratory monitoring. Moreover, uptake in the context of research had significantly better where monitoring was done by dedicated research staff. In the absence of point of care (POC) testing, the limited capacity for blood sample transportation between clinic and laboratory and poor quality of nursing staff were identified as a major barrier for treatment monitoring practice.
   Conclusions: There is a paucity of data on the uptake of treatment monitoring, particularly with longer-term follow-up. Wide variation in access to both virological and immunological regular monitoring was observed, with some clinics in well-resourced settings supported by external donors achieving high coverage. The feasibility of treatment monitoring, particularly in decentralized settings of HIV treatment and care may thus be of concern and requires further study. Significant investment in POC diagnostic technologies and, improving the quality of and training for nursing staff is required to ensure effective scale up of ART programs towards the targets of 90-90-90 by the year 2020.

AB  - Sustainable and circular production models, such as the circular economy and circular bioeconomy, have become key mechanisms to leave behind the traditional linear model of food production. Under this approach and considering the waste biomass potential available in Spain and the Czech Republic, the main objective of this study is to analyse the most relevant aspects of the generation, use and regulation of agricultural waste biomass (AWB) in both countries. For this purpose, a scientometric analysis and systematic review of published research in the Scopus database were carried out. A complementary analysis of AWB management policies and regulations was also part of the methodology. The results show that Spain has published almost twice as much research as the Czech Republic. Furthermore, 91% of the retrieved research prioritizes the characterization and estimation of the potential of more than 15 AWB types. Among the main ones are olive residues, horticultural residues and wheat straw, which are used for producing organic amendments, bioenergy and biofuels. The results confirm that the reduction and valorization of AWB is an issue that has become more important in the last 13 years, mainly due to the policies and strategies for circular economy and circular bioeconomy. With this in mind, this study provides relevant information for governments on the aspects that need to be improved to advance in the valorization of AWB. This study also provides guidance to farmers on the reduction and/or recovery alternatives that they can implement to move towards sustainable and circular agriculture.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To identify the barriers faced by women living with obstetric fistula in low-income countries that prevent them from seeking care, reaching medical centres and receiving appropriate care.
   METHODS Bibliographic databases, grey literature, journals, and network and organisation websites were searched in English and French from June to July 2014 and again from August to November 2016 using key search terms and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for discussion of barriers to fistula treatment. Experts provided recommendations for additional sources.
   RESULTS Of 5829 articles screened, 139 were included in the review. Nine groups of barriers to treatment were identified: psychosocial, cultural, awareness, social, financial, transportation, facility shortages, quality of care and political leadership. Interventions to address barriers primarily focused on awareness, facility shortages, transportation, financial and social barriers. At present, outcome data, though promising, are sparse and the success of interventions in providing long-term alleviation of barriers is unclear.
   CONCLUSION Results from the review indicate that there are many barriers to fistula treatment, which operate at the individual, community and national levels. The successful treatment of obstetric fistula may thus require targeting several barriers, including depression, stigma and shame, lack of community-based referral mechanisms, financial cost of the procedure, transportation difficulties, gender power imbalances, the availability of facilities that offer fistula repair, community reintegration and the competing priorities of political leadership.

AB  - Objective To examine the qualitative literature on low-income women's perspectives on the barriers to high-quality prenatal and postpartum care. Data Sources and Study Setting We performed searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, SocIndex, and CINAHL for peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2021. Study Design A systematic review of qualitative studies with participants who were currently pregnant or had delivered within the past 2 years and identified as low-income at delivery. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, evaluated study quality, and extracted information on study design and themes. Principal Findings We identified 34 studies that met inclusion criteria, including 23 focused on prenatal care, 6 on postpartum care, and 5 on both. The most frequently mentioned barriers to prenatal and postpartum care were structural. These included delays in gaining pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage, challenges finding providers who would accept Medicaid, lack of provider continuity, transportation and childcare hurdles, and legal system concerns. Individual-level factors, such as lack of awareness of pregnancy, denial of pregnancy, limited support, conflicting priorities, and indifference to pregnancy, also interfered with the timely use of prenatal and postpartum care. For those who accessed care, experiences of dismissal, discrimination, and disrespect related to race, insurance status, age, substance use, and language were common. Conclusions Over a period of 30 years, qualitative studies have identified consistent structural and individual barriers to high-quality prenatal and postpartum care. Medicaid policy changes, including expanding presumptive eligibility, increased reimbursement rates for pregnancy services, payment for birth doula support, and extension of postpartum coverage, may help overcome these challenges.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the determinant factors of climate change adaptation (CCA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
   Design/methodology/approach
   Studies that focused on determinant factors of CCA by crop-livestock farmers and pastoralists in SSA and written in English were reviewed from five major databases using the applications of Endnote and NVivo. The review process followed a sequence of steps to reach into the final selection.
   Findings
   A total of 3,028 papers were recovered from the databases and screened for duplicates (777) and publications before 2000 (218). The titles and abstracts of 2,033 papers were reviewed, and 1,903 of them were excluded owing to preliminary exclusion criteria. Finally, 130 papers were selected for full-text review and more detailed assessment, where 36 papers qualified for the final review. The most important determinant factors of CCA by pastoralists were household income, access to information, access to extension services, government support and access to market. In the case of agro-pastoralists, access to information, household income, age and land/livestock ownership were found as the major determinant factors. Household income, land ownership, access to information, farm size, household size and access to extension services were the determinant factors found for CCA by smallholder farmers.
   Originality/value
   After clearly stating the research question, a literature search was conducted from the major databases for climate-related research, and a comprehensive search was performed by two independent researchers.

AB  - Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) refers to efforts to bi-directionally link the electric power system and the transportation system in ways that can improve the sustainability and security of both. A transition to V2G could enable vehicles to simultaneously improve the efficiency (and profitability) of electricity grids, reduce greenhouse gas emissions for transport, accommodate low-carbon sources of energy, and reap cost savings for owners, drivers, and other users. To understand the recent state of this field of research, here we conduct a systematic review of 197 peer-reviewed articles published on V2G from 2015 to early 2017. We find that the majority of V2G studies in that time period focus on technical aspects of V2G, notably renewable energy storage, batteries, or load balancing to minimize electricity costs, in some cases including environmental goals as constraints. A much lower proportion of studies focus on the importance of assessing environmental and climate attributes of a V2G transition, or on the role of consumer acceptance and knowledge of V2G systems. Further, there is need for exploratory work on natural resource use and externalities, discourses and narratives as well as social justice, gender, and urban resilience considerations. These research gaps need to be addressed if V2G is to achieve the societal transition its advocates seek.

AB  - Rural and urban areas are economically, socially, and environmentally interlinked spaces. Ecosystem services are among the major areas of rural-urban linkages in which their interdependence is highly manifested. This paper is based on the systematic review of diversified theoretical and empirical literature. The different mutual benefits that rural and urban areas gain from their linkage are analyzed from the ecosystem services perspective. The main aim was to explain how rural area ecosystem services can be used to strengthen rural-urban linkages. Urban development is generally unthinkable in the absence of rural development, particularly for areas where agriculture is the mainstay of the economy. Rural areas are absolutely necessary for urban areas to function. Almost all ecosystem services of urban areas are imported from rural areas. Urban areas rely on rural areas to meet their demands for food, water, wood, raw materials, etc., which are basically products of rural ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the benefit that rural areas gain from urban development, such as market, farm inputs, employment opportunities, etc. should not be overlooked. Thus, well managed rural-urban linkage is imperative based on a principle that urban development should not affect the supply of rural ecosystem services and rural life at all. Furthermore, the rural population should be given policy attention to the ecosystem services the rural areas are providing and the rural area's ecosystem should be protected for its sustainable service delivery.

AB  - Objective: The use of behavioral interventions has been shown to improve glycemic control, however, the effectiveness of different behavioral interventions in one of the most high risk populations, African Americans, remains unclear. Our systematic review identified and examined findings of published behavioral interventions targeted at African Americans to improve glycemic control. The goal of our study was to distinguish which interventions were effective and identify areas for future research.
   Design: Medline, PsychInfo, and CINAHL were searched for articles published from January 2000 through January 2012 using a reproducible strategy. Study eligibility criteria included interventions aimed at changing behavior in adult African Americans with type 2 diabetes and measured glycemic control.
   Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, of which five showed a statistically significant change in HbA1c in the intervention group when compared to the control group. Summary information and characteristics of the reviewed studies are provided.
   Conclusions: Characteristics of successful interventions included using problem solving with the patient, culturally tailoring the intervention, and using a nurse educator. Limitations include the limited number of intervention studies available using glycemic control as the outcome measure. Clinical trials are needed to determine how best to tailor interventions to this largely underserved population and studies should describe details of cultural tailoring to provide information for future programs.

AB  - There is growing interest in gene editing farm animals. Some alterations could benefit animal welfare (e.g., improved heat tolerance in cattle with the "slick " gene), the environment (e.g., reducing methane emissions from cattle with induced pluripotent stem cells), and productivity (e.g., higher weight gains in cattle with the "double muscling " gene). Existing scholarship on the acceptability of such modifications has used myriad approaches to identify societal factors that shape the ethics and governance of this technology. We argue that integrating historical approaches-particularly from the relatively new and burgeoning field of animal history-offers a form of "anticipatory knowledge " that can help guide discussions on this topic. We conducted a systematic review of the animal history literature in English, German, and Spanish to identify the influence of political, scientific, economic, social, and cultural factors on the development and acceptance of such technologies. We identified analogous structures and fault lines in past debates about farm animals that provide insights for contemporary discussions about gene editing. Those analogous structures include the market power of meatpackers or the racialized precepts in livestock breeding, and fault lines, like the disconnect between states and citizens over the direction of food systems. Highlighting these similarities demonstrates how external forces have shaped-and will continue to shape-the acceptance or rejection of emerging biotechnologies as applied to farm animals.

AB  - Infrastructure governance has emerged as a subject of critical interest in the current 'infrastructure turn' whereby fragmented governance approaches sit in tension with complex demands for infrastructure transformations within contexts of multiple intersecting crises. To understand the state of the literature and inform ongoing debates, a systematic review method is used to interrogate a large body of infrastructure governance literature across sectoral boundaries. This review identifies a range of literature gaps prevailing in the areas of infrastructure governance on unceded First Nations land, the societal end goals of infrastructure, and understandings and applications of integrated governance.

AB  - Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, this report conducts a thorough evaluation of the literature on the present progress in research on and the performance of net-zero-carbon cities (NZCCs). The quantitative analysis identifies ten major areas at this stage, and this analysis is followed by a systematic review of the dynamics and cutting-edge issues of research in the hot literature in this area. The systematic review reveals that the key points of NZCC transformation at this stage are research on zero-carbon buildings, urban paradigms, policies, economics, and renewable energy. Finally, based on the results of the previous analysis, to build the theoretical framework of NZCCs and combined with the sustainable development goals, future research directions are proposed, such as urban infrastructure transformation and low-carbon transportation, policy support and system reform, and digital transformation as well as coupling and balancing the relationships of various elements. In addition, cities need to develop evaluation indicators based on specific developments, and policy adaptability and flexibility are crucial for promoting cities' efforts to achieve zero emissions. The current study provides targeted theoretical references and assistance for future policymakers and researchers, as well as advances and trends in the field of net zero carbon and associated research material from an urban viewpoint.

AB  - Diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria are the largest contributors to childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. While supply side efforts to deliver effective and affordable interventions are being scaled up, ensuring timely and appropriate use by caregivers remains a challenge. This systematic review synthesises qualitative evidence on the factors that underpin household recognition and response to child diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
   For this review, we searched six electronic databases, hand searched 12 journals from 1980 to 2010 using key search terms, and solicited expert review. We identified 5104 possible studies and included 112. Study quality was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. We followed a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesise findings according to three main themes: how households understand these illnesses, how social relationships affect recognition and response, and how households act to prevent and treat these illnesses. We synthesise these findings into a conceptual model for understanding household pathways to care and decision making.
   Factors that influence household careseeking include: cultural beliefs and illness perceptions; perceived illness severity and efficacy of treatment; rural location, gender, household income and cost of treatment. Several studies also emphasise the importance of experimentation, previous experience with health services and habit in shaping household choices.
   Moving beyond well-known barriers to careseeking and linear models of pathways to care, the review suggests that treatment decision making is a dynamic process characterised by uncertainty and debate, experimentation with multiple and simultaneous treatments, and shifting interpretations of the illness and treatment options, with household decision making hinging on social negotiations with a broad variety of actors and influenced by control over financial resources. The review concludes with research recommendations for tackling remaining gaps in knowledge. C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this systematic literature review was to explore a new phenomenon in management literature, i.e workplace spirituality and sustainability in employee performance. It was found by exploring the literature that spiritual workplace impacts employee performance and its sustainability over the longer run. However, very nascent research work has been done in this domain and the current paper addressed this gap by sifting through the research work already been done so far and indicating potential areas of research. Literature review comprised of studies from a period of 12 years, i.e 2010- 2021. PRISMA framework has been used for this review which is a standard reporting procedure for systematic reviews. Paper concluded by offering some insights into this new concept and future research directions have been provided as well.

AB  - Using islands as a model system, this paper seeks to understand how ecosystem service valuation (ESV) has and can move from a monetized, single-service paradigm to an integrated valuation paradigm, a participatory approach that represents a more diverse set of the values of nature, and beyond, to a more fully realized conception of the island social-ecological systems. A systematic literature review of 314 island ESV studies reveals developments in the design, implementation and adoption of ESV studies over time. We complement the review with three cases where this evolution is happening, thereby offering insights into successful means of translating ESV into information useful for island system-scale management, policy design and planning. Over the past 30 years, both the number of studies and the number of services addressed per study have steadily grown, and valuation methods have become more inclusive of multiple values. The cases reveal lessons for ESV practice. Insights are that ESV should increasingly: (i) recognize strong interconnections between ecosystems and between human and environmental systems; (ii) move towards more integrated valuation methods that better capture the diverse values of nature; and (iii) be based on an iterative process where knowledge and decision-support tools are co-created with decision-makers and stakeholders.

AB  - Although mine closure problems have been researched in the past, little to no research has been dedicated to the post-reclamation impacts of abandoned mine closure. Even though reclamation has been an age-old identified technique, stakeholders' perception has played an important role in defining the implementation procedure. Therefore, this study intends to identify the various implementation procedures through a rigorous literature assessment of 112 publications, identified from various sources. Theoretical and practical complications have been identified in the fields of environmental, socio-cultural and economic impacts of mine closure. The study unveiled that the most implemented reclamation strategy was intensive and nonintensive recreation/tourism-based reclamation techniques. Thus the study paves the way for the incorporation of an interdisciplinary strategy through cooperation between various stakeholders and research fields for the long-term viability of a mining site restoration.

AB  - Disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, affect the configuration, composition, and function of forested ecosystems. Complex system behaviors emerge from the interactions between disturbance regimes, the vegetation response to those disturbances, and their interplay with multiple drivers (climate, topography, land use, etc.) across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we summarize conceptual advances and empirical approaches to disturbance interaction investigation, and used those insights to evaluate and categorize 146 landscape modeling studies emerging from a systematic review of the literature published since 2010. Recent conceptual advances include formal disaggregation of disturbances into their constituent components, embedding disturbance processes into system dynamics, and clarifying terminology for interaction factors, types, and ecosystem responses. Empirical studies investigating disturbance interactions now span a wide range of approaches, including (most recently) advanced statistical methods applied to an expanding set of spatial and temporal datasets. Concurrent development in spatially-explicit landscape models, informed by these empirical insights, integrate the interactions among natural and anthropogenic disturbances by coupling these processes to account for disturbance stochasticity, disturbance within and across scales, and non-linear landscape responses to climate change. Still, trade-offs between model elegance and complexity remain. We developed an index for the degree of process integration (i.e., balance of static vs. dynamic components) within a given disturbance agent and applied it to the studies from our systematic review. Contemporary model applications in this line of research have applied a wide range process integration, depending on the specific question, but also limited in part by data and knowledge. Non-linear "threshold" behavior and cross-scaled interactions remain a frontier in temperate, boreal, and alpine regions of North America and Europe, while even simplistic studies are lacking from other regions of the globe (e.g., subtropical and tropical biomes). Understanding and planning for uncertainty in system behavior-including disturbance interactions-is paramount at a time of accelerated anthropogenic change. While progress in landscape modeling studies in this area is evident, work remains to increase model transparency and confidence, especially for understudied regions and processes. Moving forward, a multi-dimensional approach is recommended to address the uncertainties of complex human-ecological dynamics.

AB  - Obtaining public and/or private finance for upscaling urban nature-based solutions (NBS) is a key barrier for reaching urban sustainability goals, including climate mitigation and adaptation. We carry out a systematic review of the academic literature to understand the key barriers and corresponding strategies for financing urban NBS. First, we report on specific financing challenges and strategies found for NBS uptake in four urban ecological domains: buildings, facades and roofs; urban green space (parks, trees); allotment gardens (including urban agriculture); and green-blue infrastructure. Across domains, we identify two overarching barriers of NBS finance: (1) coordination between private and public financiers and (2) integration of NBS benefits into valuation and accounting methods. We discuss strategies found in the literature that address these barriers; here, two things stand out. One, there is a large variety of valuation strategies that does not yet allow for an integrated accounting and valuation framework for NBS. Two, strategies aimed at coordinating public/private finance generally look for ways to encourage specific actors (real estate developers, residents) that benefit privately from an NBS to provide co-financing. We visualize our findings into a framework for enabling (public and/or private) finance for upscaling urban NBS.

AB  - Telecoupled flows of people, organisms, goods, information, and energy are expanding across the globe. Causes are integral components of the telecoupling framework, yet the rigor with which they have been identified and evaluated to date is unknown. We address this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing causal attribution in the telecoupling literature (n = 89 studies) and developing a standardized causal terminology and typology for consistent use in telecoupling research. Causes are defined based on six criteria: sector (e.g., environmental, economic), system of origin (i.e., sending, receiving, spillover), agent, distance, response time (i.e., time lapse between cause and effect), and direction (i.e., producing positive or negative effects). Using case studies from the telecoupling literature, we demonstrate the need to enhance the rigor of telecoupling causal attribution by combining qualitative and quantitative methods via process-tracing, counterfactual analysis, and related approaches. Rigorous qualitative-quantitative causal attribution is critical for accurately assessing the social-ecological causes and consequences of telecouplings and thereby identifying leverage points for informed management and governance of telecoupled systems.

AB  - Recently published green infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and ecosystem disservices (ED) literature have focused primarily on the supply of urban regulating and cultural ecosystem services (ES). Other literature on urban and peri-urban agriculture has mostly studied the role of localized, intensive agricultural practices in providing food to inhabitants. The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of urban provisioning ES, particularly when implementing an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach as it can offer improved resilience and quality of life in cities. We compiled and systematically analyzed studies on urban ES and ED related to a number of EGI typologies. Our systematic review of the relevant literature via an EGI framework, identified more than 80 peer-reviewed publications that focused on ES and food production in urban areas. An EGI approach can contribute socially, economically, and environmentally to urban sustainability and food security. However, such benefits must be weighed against ED trade-offs, including: potential health risks caused by human exposure to heavy metals and organic chemical contaminants often present in urban surroundings. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for incorporating EGI into urban planning and design, and discuss novel areas for future research.

AB  - Main conclusionEnvironmental DNA-based monitoring provides critical insights for enhancing our understanding of plant-animal interactions in the context of worldwide biodiversity decrease for developing a global framework for effective plant biodiversity conservation.AbstractTo understand the ecology and evolutionary patterns of plant-animal interactions (PAI) and their pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning advances in molecular ecology tools such as Environmental DNA (eDNA) provide unprecedented research avenues. These methods being non-destructive in comparison to traditional biodiversity monitoring methods, enhance the discernment of ecosystem health, integrity, and complex interactions. This review intends to offer a systematic and critical appraisal of the prospective of eDNA for investigating PAI. The review thoroughly discusses and analyzes the recent reports (2015-2022) employing preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to outline the recent progression in eDNA approaches for elucidating PAI. The current review envisages that eDNA has a significant potential to monitor both plants and associated cohort of prospective pollinators (avian species and flowering plants, bees and plants, arthropods and plants, bats and plants, etc.). Furthermore, a brief description of the factors that influence the utility and interpretation of PAI eDNA is also presented. The review establishes that factors such as biotic and abiotic, primer selection and taxonomic resolution, and indeterminate spatio-temporal scales impact the availability and longevity of eDNA. The study also identified the limitations that influence PAI detection and suggested possible solutions for better execution of these molecular approaches. Overcoming these research caveats will augment the assortment of PAI analysis through eDNA that could be vital for ecosystem health and integrity. This review forms a critical guide and offers prominent insights for ecologists, environmental managers and researchers to assess and evaluate plant-animal interaction through environmental DNA.

AB  - The application of telestroke has matured considerably since its inception in 1999. The use of telestroke is now recommended in several published guidelines. Consequently, jurisdictions without a telestroke service are seeking practical information on the best approach to implement telestroke. French et al. (2013) reviewed the challenges of implementing a telestroke network including studies between 2000 and 2010. At the time, telestroke networks were largely limited to the UK, USA, Canada and Europe and only one process evaluation had been conducted. Given the prolific expansion of telestroke services since 2010, we conducted a systematic review to determine factors associated with successful establishment, management, and sustainability of a contemporary telestroke services. A comprehensive search of telestroke studies was conducted in July 2021. Empirical studies published between 2010 and 2021 were included if they contained descriptive, evaluation or operational data on the implementation of a telestroke network. Studies were subsequently evaluated using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The initial literature search revealed a total of 7415 potential studies; 38 of which met the inclusion criteria. The past decade of process evaluation studies has enabled a more nuanced investigations into how to implement and sustain a telestroke network. Pre-implementation planning is crucial to ensure clear telestroke processes, governance structures and stakeholder engagement. Sustainability of networks relies on securing long-term investment, providing adequate resources, and maintaining staff motivation and willingness. Recommendations are provided to overcome commonly identified barriers related to technology, staffing, planning and standardisation of processes, evaluation, and sustainability and scale-up. Further research needs to explore how new advancements in stroke care such as endovascular clot retrieval (EVT) and advanced brain imaging can be considered and planned for during the implementation of a new telestroke service.

AB  - Landscape pattern and climate change impact ecosystem services and consequently the sustainability of regions and the entire earth system. Yet, we lack an adequate understanding of the interactions among landscape pattern, climate change, and ecosystem services, or the landscape-climate-ecosystems (LCE) nexus. Improving our understanding of the LCE nexus can help create multifunctional landscapes that are resilient to environmental and socioeconomic perturbations. Thus, the main objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to review and synthesize the existing studies of the LCE nexus and (2) to identify research gaps and discuss future research directions to better understand the LCE nexus. Using the SCOPUS database, we followed the procedure of a systematic review to search and review articles that simultaneously addressed multiple links in the LCE nexus. Our review revealed that landscape governance and planning play an important role in determining the composition and configuration of regional landscapes. In addition, changes in landscape pattern and climate can variably impact provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services. Although many studies have addressed individual links in the LCE nexus, multiple-step linkages have been rarely addressed. Moving forward, therefore, we should focus more on multi-step linkages and the entire LCE nexus to better understand the feedback loops within the nexus. Doing so is necessary for improving landscape and regional sustainability. In addition, future research needs transdisciplinary approaches that integrate the social and ecological systems in regional landscapes to understand not only how landscape pattern and climate change influence ecosystem services, but also how changes in ecosystem services feedback to affect landscape pattern.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis (IS) employs a cross-organizational perspective to seek synergistic pairings of one company's waste output to another company's input, enabled by interfirm cooperation through resource and information sharing. Orchestrating IS relationships among companies, however, remains a complex process. In the literature, a wide range of qualitative and quantitative tools have emerged, tackling issues ranging from identifying IS creation opportunities to performance evaluation. Thus far, the available literature has focused on separate aspects and perspective of IS creation. Each individual work contributes, in part, to the overall process of IS creation. The disparate perspectives provided by the literature reflect the fragmented nature of available tools supporting IS, which operate in isolation of each other. An encompassing view of tools supporting the process of IS creation is missing to date. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study aims to develop a more comprehensive description of the landscape of IS tools by analyzing the associated approaches, roles, and contribution of existing tools. Through this understanding, the insights gained can be used to aid future development and advancement of tools for IS practitioners.

AB  - Many metals and minerals are the backbone of the clean energy transition. However, its extraction and pro-duction are known to be a source of various environmental impacts. The use of a multicriteria assessment tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production of these elements is still poorly developed. Therefore, science-based decisions to achieve carbon neutrality are limited as the whole life cycle is generally not considered. This systematic review was conducted to analyse three main aspects: (i) the context of LCA application in the mining industry, (ii) the methodology followed by LCA practitioners in liter-ature, and (iii) the environmental impacts of different metals and minerals in multiple contexts. Seventy-eight (78) papers studying the life cycle of different metals and minerals were analyzed. The results of the method-ology adopted in literature show some tendencies in terms of functional unit, system boundary, data source and software used. Among the studied elements, gold showed the highest impact in the global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification (TP), water depletion (WD) and land use (LU). In the other hand, the comparison of those elements' global carbon footprint in 2021 showed that coal has scored the highest impact at 1.49x109 t CO2 eq. This study highlights also the need to conduct more LCA studies on strategic metals (Li, Co, Mn, REE) for the clean energy transition to reach the net zero carbon target. Moreover, a comparative analysis between the reported data in the Ecoinvent database and the average values extracted from literature showed aligned results for GWP while it reveals a gap for the other indicators.

AB  - Plastic litter is a pollutant of aquatic environments worldwide, with some of the world's highest litter densities occur-ring in freshwater ecosystems. Little information about the risk that plastic litter poses to aquatic wildlife is available across the world's most polluted waterways. To help assess the risk to aquatic species where empirical data is lacking, our review presents i) a risk assessment methodology for predicting plastic litter impacts on aquatic wildlife in data poor environments, ii) a case study demonstrating this risk assessment methodology for wildlife across two heavily polluted river basins in Asia, the Mekong and Ganges River Basins; and iii) a broad review summarising common trends in litter interactions and risk to freshwater fish, aquatic birds, cetaceans and raptors. This risk analysis unites a systematic review approach with risk matrices following International Standards Organization's risk assessment criteria, evaluating the risk of plastic entanglement and ingestion and the potential for harm to the animal. In the Me-kong and Ganges River Basins, we found that the risk of litter entanglement is higher than litter ingestion. Four species were forecast to be at high risk of entanglement: Ganges River dolphin, Gharial, Mekong giant catfish and Irrawaddy dolphin. The eastern imperial eagle and greater spotted eagle were noted to be at moderate risk of entanglement. Both the Ganges River dolphin and Irrawaddy dolphin were predicted to have a moderate risk of plastic ingestion. Interest-ingly, cranes, waterfowl and wading birds were deemed at low or negligible risk from plastic litter. This risk matrix methodology can be applied to other waterways and taxa to assess the risk posed by plastic. It can also be readily up-dated as more information becomes available. This review enables decision makers to bridge a data gap by providing a tool for conservation and management before comprehensive empirical data is available.

AB  - Human attitudes and behaviours have been linked to the degradation of global biodiversity, particularly forest ecosystems. Indeed, effective conservation actions require that the attitudes and behaviours of affected individuals and communities are taken into account. While several studies have examined how human attitudes and behaviours affect conservation, it is still unclear which, and how, human value orientations influence conservation attitudes and behaviour. This is critical because attitudes and behaviours are underpinned by the complex concept of human values. Thus, effective management and conservation of environmental resources requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of these values, and how they affect attitudinal and behavioural preferences towards the natural environment and their protection. Here we review the human value orientations influencing people's attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation, and discuss how conservation projects can be more successful by aligning their goals and operations to people's values. To do this, we carried out a scoping review, using the sub-Saharan Africa region as a case study, and followed the PRISMA-ScR systematic review guidelines. A narrative synthesis was adopted for data analysis. We identified different value types that fall within three broad human value orientation domains influencing forest conservation attitudes and behaviours. Anthropocentric and relational value orientations emerged as most dominant, with both positive and negative influences on a number of forest conservation attitudes and behaviours, albeit with more evidence for positive influence. The positive attitudes and behaviours were linked to utilitarian motivations and cultural beliefs and include rural support for conservation, compliance to forest rules, sustainable forest use, and participation in forest management. The values linked to dependence on forest resources, low benefits from conservation, and conservation costs, tend to trigger negative conservation attitudes and behaviours. To effectively achieve forest conservation goals, environmental managers, conservationists, and decision-makers should understand the extent and directional influence of value orientations on conservation attitudes and behaviours.

AB  - Coastal zones in Latin America support a significant regional population and are vital for providing essential ecosystem services that underpin crucial socio economic activities. However, these zones face pressing challenges, with coastal erosion being a prominent concern. Coastal erosion not only jeopardizes coastal stability but also leads to occasional loss of natural habitats. This is particularly worrisome for sandy beaches due to the consistent shoreline retreat in specific regions. Short term adverse effects of coastal erosion are often attributed to human activities. Nonetheless, the influence of hydrodynamic processes, intensified by extreme events, is gaining prominence. This is due to the combined impact of tides, waves, currents, and other factors, resulting in accelerated shoreline retreat and significant losses of infrastructure and beach areas across Latin America. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of case studies in Latin America related to coastal erosion due to hydrodynamic processes. Employing a systematic review approach, data is extracted from Scopus and Web of Science databases. From an initial dataset of 701 records, 62 records meet strict eligibility criteria. Case studies present evidence of how hydrodynamic processes interact with various factors, encompassing oceanic climatic conditions, atmospheric climatic conditions, anthropogenic influences, geomorphological and bathymetric characteristics, geological and tectonic factors, and climate change related aspects. These interactions have an immediate and significant impact on sandy beaches, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensively addressing these linkages when analyzing shoreline changes. This approach aids in identifying key erosion mechanisms and developing effective mitigation measures. Furthermore, the article provides a concise overview of data sources, tools, and methodologies identified in the case studies, spanning from field investigations to the utilization of geographic information systems and numerical models. Underscores the crucial role of international academic collaboration in coastal erosion research, facilitating the adoption of innovative methodologies from other regions, potentially offering a more comprehensive perspective in the formulation of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Finally, potential areas for future research in Latin America are explored, including the assessment of extreme event variability and its impacts on local and regional hydrodynamic processes. This aspect holds critical importance in steering future research towards scenarios that encompass economic and social considerations.

AB  - Introduction: Environmental sustainability (ES) in healthcare is an important current challenge in the wider context of reducing the environmental impacts of human activity. Identifying key routes to making clinical radiology and radiotherapy (CRR) practice more environmentally sustainable will provide a framework for delivering greener clinical services. This study sought to explore and integrate current evidence regarding ES in CRR departments, to provide a comprehensive guide for greener practice, education, and research. Methods: A systematic literature search and review of studies of diverse evidence including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approach was completed across six databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSDD) was used to assess the included studies. A result-based convergent data synthesis approach was employed to integrate the study findings.Results: A total of 162 articles were identified. After applying a predefined exclusion criterion, fourteen articles were eligible. Three themes emerged as potentially important areas of CRR practice that contribute to environmental footprint: energy consumption and data storage practices; usage of clinical consumables and waste management practices; and CRR activities related to staff and patient travel.Conclusions: Key components of CRR practice that influence environmental impact were identified, which could serve as a framework for exploring greener practice interventions. Widening the scope of research, education and awareness is imperative to providing a holistic appreciation of the environmental burden of healthcare. Implications for practice: Encouraging eco-friendly travelling options, leveraging artificial Intelligence (AI) and CRR specific policies to optimise utilisation of resources such as energy and radiopharmaceuticals are recommended for a greener practice.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Microplastics receive significant societal and scientific attention due to increasing concerns about their impact on the environment and human health. Marine mammals are considered indicators for marine ecosystem health and many species are of conservation concern due to a multitude of anthropogenic stressors. Marine mammals may be vulnerable to microplastic exposure from the environment, via direct ingestion from sea water, and indirect uptake from their prey. Here we present the first systematic review of literature on microplastics and marine mammals, composing of 30 studies in total. The majority of studies examined the gastrointestinal tracts of beached, bycaught or hunted cetaceans and pinnipeds, and found that microplastics were present in all but one study, and the abundance varied between 0 and 88 particles per animal. Additionally, microplastics in pinniped scats (faeces) were detected in eight out of ten studies, with incidences ranging from 0% of animals to 100%. Our review highlights considerable methodological and reporting deficiencies and differences among papers, making comparisons and extrapolation across studies difficult. We suggest best practices to avoid these issues in future studies. In addition to empirical studies that quantified microplastics in animals and scat, ten studies out of 30 (all focussing on cetaceans) tried to estimate the risk of exposure using two main approaches; i) overlaying microplastic in the environment (water or prey) with cetacean habitat or ii) proposing biological or chemical biomarkers of exposure. We discuss advice and best practices on research into the exposure and impact of microplastics in marine mammals. This work on marine ecosystem health indicator species will provide valuable and comparable information in the future. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.Y

AB  - Academics, policymakers, and practitioners have long considered peace and sustainability to be fundamentally linked. However, despite the increased attention paid toward the intersection of peace and sustainability, there is still limited knowledge on the nature of their linkages. To advance the current understanding on the peace-sustainability nexus and inform an integrated research agenda, this paper employs a scientometric analysis of literature to identify publication trends, thematic clusters, and knowledge gaps. Analyzing the publications according to the types of peace, the pillars of positive peace, the dimensions of sustainability, and the SDGs further reveals weak engagement among academic disciplines and across the SDGs. The results of this analysis emphasize the need for future research to focus on underexamined subjects, geographic regions, and sectors to bolster the linkages between peace and sustainability.

AB  - Background Social life-cycle assessment (S-LCA) provides a framework to evaluate the social impacts of decisions made during the design phases of a product. Rooftop solar panels are considered an environmentally friendly renewable energy technology due to their ability to generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases while generating electricity. This study presents the application of a challenge-derived S-LCA framework to assess the social impacts of rooftop solar panels in the southeast region of the United States (U.S.) during the use and end-of-life phases. Methods The challenge-derived S-LCA framework was developed based on a set of challenges to performing social assessments. The challenges were identified through a systematic mapping process and verified using expert feedback. Additional feedback is gathered through users from mechanical engineering capstone design students. The case study application shown in this paper aims to identify the potential social impacts at a pre-implementation stage of the rooftop solar panel in residential applications. The framework follows the ISO 14040 LCA structure, and the analysis was performed based on impact indicators (Type-I framework) and performance reference points (PRP). Results The framework implements existing social impact assessment methodologies, and guides each of the assessment stages based on the type of analysis performed. The results highlight the workers as the stakeholder group with the highest social impacts. The results also highlight the need for regulation to make rooftop solar panels accessible to low-income community members. Conclusions An S-LCA framework to assess the social impacts of product systems and technologies is implemented to evaluate the potential social impacts of residential rooftop solar panels. The framework presented applies to product systems and technologies at a pre- or post-implementation state, and it aims to guide novice and expert users alike. Nonetheless, further research is still needed to improve the methodology presented, and additional case studies should be performed to test the applicability of the framework across a broad set of fields.

AB  - The existing literature mapping the state of mixed methods research in tourism does not provide in-depth information concerning the number and type of mixed methods studies published in tourism, or the paradigmatic beliefs informing the mix of quantitative and qualitative studies in the same project. By conducting a systematic review of articles published between 2005 and 2016 in tourism journals, this work seeks to answer four main research questions: (1) how have different tourism scholars employed mixed methods in their studies?; (2) what approaches have been utilised in mixed methods studies?; (3) how are paradigm(s) conceptualised in mixed method designs?; and (4) how is reflexivity operationalised in mixed method designs? Overall, the findings show that the majority of mixed methods tourism studies have not declared their epistemological, ontological and axiological stances. Also, the studies tended to privilege sequential mixes over concurrent approaches, and reflexivity was rarely contemplated.

AB  - BackgroundHealth systems are complex and continually changing across a variety of contexts and health service levels. The capacities needed by health managers and leaders to respond to current and emerging issues are not yet well understood. Studies to date have been country-specific and have not integrated different international and multi-level insights. This review examines the current and emerging challenges for health leadership and workforce management in diverse contexts and health systems at three structural levels, from the overarching macro (international, national) context to the meso context of organisations through to the micro context of individual healthcare managers.MethodsA rapid review of evidence was undertaken using a systematic search of a selected segment of the diverse literature related to health leadership and management. A range of text words, synonyms and subject headings were developed for the major concepts of global health, health service management and health leadership. An explorative review of three electronic databases (MEDLINE (R), Pubmed and Scopus) was undertaken to identify the key publication outlets for relevant content between January 2010 to July 2018. A search strategy was then applied to the key journals identified, in addition to hand searching the journals and reference list of relevant papers identified. Inclusion criteria were independently applied to potentially relevant articles by three reviewers. Data were subject to a narrative synthesis to highlight key concepts identified.ResultsSixty-three articles were included. A set of consistent challenges and emerging trends within healthcare sectors internationally for health leadership and management were represented at the three structural levels. At the macro level these included societal, demographic, historical and cultural factors; at the meso level, human resource management challenges, changing structures and performance measures and intensified management; and at the micro level shifting roles and expectations in the workplace for health care managers.ConclusionContemporary challenges and emerging needs of the global health management workforce orient around efficiency-saving, change and human resource management. The role of health managers is evolving and expanding to meet these new priorities. Ensuring contemporary health leaders and managers have the capabilities to respond to the current landscape is critical.

AB  - Motivated by the rising attention of businesses and regulators towards how digital transformation can assist sustainability improvement, this paper sheds light on the relationships between these two phenomena. Specifically, this research pioneers the study of 'digital sustainability' through a systematic review of 153 academic articles aimed to 1) consolidate the existing research, 2) understand the thematic connections amongst the different studies, and 3) identify research gaps to move forward in the development of the topic. The suggested research agenda has important theoretical and practical implications. Through the identified gaps, this study acknowledges the management scholarship of pitfalls and delays on the research topic, providing detailed guidance to develop this new stream of subject area. The opportunistic approach of this paper responds to the practical call for support in understanding the use of digitalization for sustainability-related goals. This research directly impacts a wide range of practitioners, including managers, consultants, and policymakers.

AB  - Background: To depict a comprehensive changing landscape of anti-lymphoma drug clinical trials in mainland China from 2005 to 2020.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the China National Medical Products Administration Center for Drug Evaluation platform, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov websites.
   Findings: A total of 797 anti-lymphoma drug clinical trials registered from Jan 1st, 2005 to Aug 1st, 2020 were identified. The number of trials increased gradually over time, and a notable increase was observed in 2016, with the number growing from 29 in 2015 to 72 in 2016. Trials in phase I (26.1%) and phase II (26.6%) represented the majority, followed by phase III (12.5%) and phase IV (7.4%). Regarding sponsorship, industry-sponsored trials (53.2%) accounted for a slightly larger proportion than investigator-initiated trials (IITs) (46.8%). A dramatic growth for IITs was seen during 2017-2020, with the number increasing from 36 in 2017 to 96 in 2020. Additionally, the proportion of trials involving targeted agents (50.2%) accounted for the largest, followed by trials involving immunotherapy agents (41.0%), and cytotoxic agents (8.0%). Besides, a sustainable growth was observed in the number of leading anti-lymphoma drug clinical trial units in mainland China over the past 15 years. The majority of leading principal units (60.8%) were from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Jiangsu.
   Interpretation: In the past 15 years, the research and development of drugs and clinical trials for lymphoma in mainland China has achieved much progression. Future efforts are needed for improving innovation and sustainability of pharmaceutical research and development. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A systematic review was conducted by a multidisciplinary team to analyze qualitatively best available scientific evidence on the effect of agricultural intensification and environmental changes on the risk of zoonoses for which there are epidemiological interactions between wildlife and livestock. The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.

AB  - As a new mode for Chinese overseas investment and a growth pole for industrialization and urbanization of the host countries, the overseas economic and trade cooperation zone (OETCZ) or overseas free economic zone (OFEZ) of China plays an important role under the Belt and Road Initiative. With the rising attention on OETCZ, studies regarding OETCZ have also increased. However, there is a lack of studies reviewing this topic's progress, challenges and future directions. This paper employs a systematic review to examine the literature on the OETCZ along the Belt and Road, based on domestic and overseas studies. The results show that domestic studies account for a large proportion of the collected literature, compared to overseas studies. Interdisciplinary research focus includes inductive case studies from a classification perspective, deductive studies based on cultural and institutional perspectives, trade network and bilateral trade relations based on the perspectives of international trade and regional economy, spatial planning studies from urban planning perspective, and overseas comments and earlier studies on Japan's and Singapore's overseas parks from the geopolitical and international political perspectives. Despite diverse research contents and dramatic progress, limitations exist in current OETCZ-related studies, including a lack of exploration of the mechanism, questions and concerns from overseas scholars, sustainable development and other problems. Future studies should broaden and deepen research insights, including the "overseas free economic zones (OFEZ)" as a general designation to cover all other types of OETCZs, studies on the primary conditions of host countries, exploration of the theoretical issues behind China's OETCZ, comparative study of OETCZs such as management structures, profit models, environmental standards and legal systems as well as popular issues questioned internationally.

AB  - This article is the result of a systematic review of published life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on water and wastewater treatment in Africa. After applying the search and selection criteria, 32 observations for energy use were included and 20 for the global warming potential (GWP) and the eutrophication potential (EP). The dependent variables were categorized by technical, method, and typology factors. The meta-regression model aligned with the descriptive statistics on the variation of the dependent variables due to water source but not location. Regarding energy use, GWP, and EP, the water source and the study location had the most significant influence in contrast to the life cycle impact assessment method. There is a need for more such LCA studies in Central and Western parts of Africa.

AB  - This systematic review investigated the environmental (physical, economic, socio-cultural and political) correlates of active transportation (AT) among young people aged 5-18 years to better inform the promotion of active living. Greater distance, increasing household income and increasing car ownership are consistently associated with lower rates of AT among children. Having a non-white ethnic background has a convincing positive association with AT. Having recreation facilities and walk or bike paths present are possibly associated with higher rates of AT. Further research requires longitudinal and intervention studies, utilizing multi-level design methodologies and objective measures of environmental attributes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While praziquantel mass drug administration is currently the most widely used method in the control of human schistosomiasis, it does not prevent subsequent reinfection hence persistent transmission. Towards schistosomiasis elimination, understanding the reinfection rate is crucial in planning for the future interventions. However, there is scarcity of information on the global reinfection rate of schistosomiasis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at summarizing studies that estimated the reinfection rate of human schistosomiasis. Three data bases (PubMed, Hinari and Google Scholar) were thoroughly searched to retrieve original research articles presenting data on reinfection rate of human schistosomiasis. Study quality and risk of bias was assessed based on Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist. Meta-analysis was conducted using statistical R version 3.6.2 and R Studio using "meta" and "metafor" packages. Random effect model was employed to estimate pooled reinfection rates. Heterogeneity was determined using Cochran's Q (chi-square)-test and Higgins I-2 statistics. A total of 29 studies met inclusion criteria to be included in this review. All studies had at least satisfactory (5-9 scores) quality. The overal mean and pooled reinfection rates of schistosomiasis were 36.1% (+/- 23.3%) and 33.2% (95% CI, 26.5-40.5%) respectively. For intestinal schistosomiasis, the mean and pooled reinfection rates were 43.9% (+/- 20.6%) and 43.4% (95% CI, 35.8-51.4%), and that for urogenital schistosomiasis were 17.6% (+/- 10.8%) and 19.4% (95% CI, 12.3%- 29.2%) respectively. Cochran's Q (chi-square)-test and Higgins I-2 statistic indicated significant heterogeneity across studies (p-values < 0.001, I-2 values > 95%). Results of subgroup analysis showed that, the type of Schistosoma species, participants' age group, sample size and geographical area had influence on disparity variation in reinfection rate of schistosomiasis (p < 0.1). Despite the control measures in place, the re-infection rate is still high, specifically on intestinal schistosomiasis as compared to urogenital schistosomiasis. Achieving 2030 sustainable development goal 3 on good health and wellbeing intensive programmatic strategies for schistosomiasis elimination should be implemented. Among such strategies to be used at national level are repeated mass drug administration at least every six months, intensive snails control and health education.

AB  - Historically, religion has had a central role in shaping the psychosocial and moral development of young people. While religiosity and spirituality have been linked to positive mental health outcomes in adults, their role during the developmental context of adolescence, and the mechanisms through which such beliefs might operate, is less well understood. Moreover, there is some evidence that negative aspects of religiosity are associated with poor mental health outcomes. Guided by lived experience consultants, we undertook a systematic review and quality appraisal of 45 longitudinal studies and 29 intervention studies identified from three electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus) exploring the role of religiosity and spiritual involvement (formal and informal) in prevention and management of depression and anxiety in young people aged 10 to 24 years. Most studies were from high-income countries and of low to moderate quality. Meta-analysis of high-quality longitudinal studies (assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools, n = 25) showed a trend towards association of negative religious coping (i.e., feeling abandoned by or blaming God) with greater depressive symptoms over time (Pearson's r = 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.009, 0.188) whereas spiritual wellbeing was protective against depression (Pearson's r = -0.153, CI -0.187, -0.118). Personal importance of religion was not associated with depressive symptoms overall (Pearson's r = -0.024, CI-0.053, 0.004). Interventions that involved religious and spiritual practices for depression and anxiety in young people were mostly effective, although the study quality was typically low and the heterogeneity in study designs did not allow for a meta-analysis. The lived experience consultants described spirituality and religious involvement as central to their way of life and greatly valued feeling watched over during difficult times. While we require more evidence from low- and middle-income countries, in younger adolescents and for anxiety disorders, the review provides insight into how spirituality and religious involvement could be harnessed to design novel psychological interventions for depression and anxiety in young people.Review RegistrationThe systematic review was funded by Wellcome Trust Mental Health Priority Area 'Active Ingredients' 2021 commission and registered with PROSPERO 2021 (CRD42021281912).

AB  - Western Himalaya is an important region in terms of its enriched biodiversity and immense ecosystem services (ESS). However, its biodiversity and ESS are under tremendous pressure from rapid population growth, developmental activities, unplanned urbanization, agricultural expansion, climate change, and the associated changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This study provides a systematic review of the composition and pattern of LULC (from existing literature) and the effects of LULC change on various ESS provided by the western Himalayan ecosystems. Despite being such a significant area, data and studies concerning the impacts of LULC change on the spatial distribution of ESS, focused particularly on the western Himalayan region are inadequately reported. Most existing studies indicate a general decrease in forest cover and an increase in forest fragmentation along with generally increasing trends in built-up areas, croplands, and barren lands. These results imply ecosystem degradation and a reduction in the potential for the sustainable flow of ESS from this region. In this respect, this study suggests that quantification and spatial mapping of ESS in the western Himalayan region is conducted.

AB  - Introduction Climate change is among the most renowned concerns of the current century, endangering the lives of millions of people worldwide. To comply with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), hospitals should be on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although hospitals contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases, they are also affected by the health consequences of climate change. Despite all the guidance provided, hospitals need more radical measures to confront climate change. The current study was carried out to examine the components of hospitals' adaptation to climate change and to review measures to confront climate change in hospitals. Method This systematic review was designed and carried out in 2020. The required information was collected from international electronic databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Moreover, Iranian datasets such as Scientific Database (SID), Irandoc, Magiran, and IranMedex were reviewed. No restriction was considered in the methodology of the study. For the relevant thesis, the ProQuest database was also explored. The related sources were examined and the Snowball method was applied to find additional related studies. The research team also reviewed other accessible electronic resources, such as international guidelines and academic websites. The checklist of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI, 2017) was employed in order to evaluate the quality of the included papers. The studies published until June1, 2020, were included in the study. Results Of 11,680 published documents in the initial search, the full-texts of 140 were read after evaluating the titles and abstracts, of which 114 were excluded due to lack of sufficient information related to countermeasures in hospitals. Finally, the full-texts of 26 studies were reviewed to extract the required components. Two strategies were found, including climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, with 13 components including water, wastewater, energy, waste, green buildings, food, transportation, green purchasing policy, medicines, chemicals and toxins, technology, sustainable care models, and leadership in hospitals were identified as affecting these measures and strategies. Conclusion Considering the significance of climate change and strategies to confront it as one of the current challenges and priorities in the world, it is necessary to develop a framework and model to reduce the effects of climate change and adapt to climate changes in hospitals and other health centers. The identification and classification of the measures and components, influencing hospital adaptability and solutions for reducing the climate change impacts could be the first stage in developing this strategy. This is because it is impossible to create this framework without identifying these factors and their mutual impacts at the first. In the present study, through a systematic review using a comprehensive approach, the related components were explored and divided into two categories, including measures to reduce the effects and measures to adapt to climate change. The results of this study can be useful in developing a comprehensive action model to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt hospitals to climate change.

AB  - Landscape preference (LP) studies highlight one of the most important issues of human-environment relationship, and their related publications have increased rapidly over the last two decades. However, there is no systematic review with a holistic understanding of this field. here we applied a bibliometric approach to examine the evolution of LP research and identify its status and future prospects. We obtained 7,637 LP research publications from Web of Science core collection from 1968 to 2019 and analyzed the characteristics of publication outputs as well as performances in various countries and institutions. Besides, content keywords analysis was conducted to discover the drivers, focus, motivation, and trends of LP research. We found that 1) publications, subject categories, and active journals increased rapidly since the 2000s ; 2) the USA, England, and Australia are the leading countries in LP research, while China is starting to have some influence; 3) LP research is most closely linked to ecological and environmental studies, being developed by objective drivers, i.e., interactions with landscape change, and subjective motivations ; and 4) LP research is advancing the landscape sustainability science, integrating natural and social science together through ecosystem services. By comprehensively reviewing the evolution and prospect of LP research, we provide insights for further research in this field.

AB  - Longitudinal psychological research on family outcomes provides crucial information about families in a changing society, but an evidence synthesis for Austria is currently lacking. Therefore, we aim to summarize psychological longitudinal research on family-related outcomes in Austria using a scoping review approach. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched five scientific databases (PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and conducted manual searches to identify additional grey literature. Ten sources reporting on six data collection efforts between 1991 and 2015 were identified. Most samples consisted of heterosexual nuclear families, while research on more diverse family types is needed. Methods were primarily quantitative with conventional designs, but noteworthy exceptions exist. Comprehensive longitudinal data collection efforts across child development are lacking for the new millennium. State-of-the-art research implementing a triangulation of methods, designs, and perspectives that incorporate diverse family types is needed to draw accurate conclusions about the changing family landscape in Austria.

AB  - The present work aims to review the most important aspects regard to genomic characterization of Pinzgau cattle breed. In Romania, this cattle breed is part of the country's genetic and cultural heritage and faces the impact of bottleneck and the lack of diversity due to a significant decline in population. Natural populations' genetic structure is influenced by a limited gene flow that occurs when the geographic distances between them increase. In our country, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) maintained the status of 'endangered-maintained' cattle breed in 2000 considered to be threatened with extinction. This paper wants to highlight the fact that the conservation of this breed is a national priority and also, reviews the most relevant information in the literature on the genetic diversity of this cattle breed.

AB  - Background: The built and natural environment and health are inextricably linked. However, there is considerable debate surrounding the strength and quality of the evidence base underpinning principles of good practice for built and natural environment design in promoting health. This umbrella review aimed to assess relationships between the built and natural environment and health, concentrating on five topic areas: neighbourhood design, housing, food environment, natural and sustainable environment, and transport.
   Methods: A structured search was conducted for quantitative systematic reviews and stakeholder reviews published between January 2005 and April 2016. Seven databases and the websites of 15 relevant and respected stakeholder organisations known to publish review-level documentation were searched. Searches were limited to English-language publications and duplicate references were removed. Evidence quality and strength was appraised using validated techniques. Findings were used to develop a diagram for each topic area, illustrating relationships between built and natural environment planning principles and health-related outcomes.
   Results: A total of 117 systematic reviews and review-level documents were eligible for inclusion. The quality of evidence was mixed; much of the evidence examined relied on findings from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to draw clear causal links between built environment exposures and health-related impacts and outcomes. Fourteen actionable planning principles associated with positive health-related outcomes were identified across the five topic areas. For example, neighbourhoods that enhanced walkability, were complete and compact in design, and those which enhanced connectivity through safe and efficient infrastructure were associated with better health-related outcomes relating to physical activity, social engagement, mental health, perceptions of crime, and road traffic collisions. Evidence for the effectiveness of planning principles across different topic areas and on reducing health inequalities was sparse and inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Findings provide an up-to-date overview of relationships between the built and natural environment and health and present logical, evidence-based messages to aid communication between public health and planning professionals.

AB  - Worldwide, energy use in buildings with the same function differed by a factor of 3-10, owing to behavioral issues. Future lifestyle changes in developed countries are expected to result in significant energy use reductions of up to 50% by 2050, with a correspondingly large impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, neither clear categorizations of behavioral or nontechnological (NT) climate mitigation solutions (CMS), nor corresponding estimates of global potentials for energy savings and GHG mitigation are available. Using a systematic map methodology, review of frameworks, and topic modeling, Results indicate a literature bias toward developed countries, we propose a taxonomy that conceptually covers various demands (maintained/reduced), perspectives (individual/collective), and direct energy use (yes/no), resulting in five types of NT solutions: active and passive management and operation (MO), demand flexibility, sufficient comfort levels, circular and sharing economy, and organizational and social innovations. A knowledge glut for active and passive MO has been identified, with clusters in Europe and North America. Furthermore, evidence gaps were discovered in terms of geographical scope (with very little literature available about Africa and the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia), stakeholder perspectives, and some measures (circular and sharing economy, flexibility of demand over time, social and organizational innovations). There was insufficient evidence on current NT CMS adoption and implementation costs.
   Quantified potentials were mostly found for developed countries and residential buildings, with more energy savings than GHG mitigation studies. Whereas these potentials are substantial, they vary largely among regions and solutions. The potential energy-saving ranges between 5% and 40% for most regions and CMS. The greatest potential GHG emissions reductions are seen in the circular and sharing category (25% to 70%). For other actions, most potentials range from 5% to 30%. More research is needed to provide evidence on rebound effects that can offset the climate benefits of NT solutions, business models that demonstrate their financial viability, and policy actions that trigger the already identified climate mitigation potentials of NT solutions.

AB  - The ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) is a strategy for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector, but the question of how it can be practically implemented remains unclear. Indicators that can be applied at relevant scales of impact and that reflect the environmental status and change offer a means of operationalizing EAA. Therefore, a systematic literature review was carried out to identify environmental indicators referenced in salmon aquaculture literature and review their potential to support EAA. Using the PRISMA method for selecting journal papers, 101 articles that included 531 indicators were reviewed. Indicators were characterized based on the effect of aquaculture they measure, their similarity to other indicators extracted, and the scale at which they were applied. Indicators and their characteristics are presented in a searchable online database. A scoring method for evaluating indicators based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature and the potential scalability of indicators to meet the needs of EAA was developed and applied to the most frequently referenced indicators. Overall, near-field indicators of benthic impacts dominated salmon aquaculture literature. Of the most frequently referenced indicators, those that scored highest based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature also scored highest on scalability and therefore their potential contribution to EAA. Overall, results suggest that additional research and application of far-field environmental indicators in salmon aquaculture will be required to identify a suite of indicators that can be applied as part of EAA practice.

AB  - In 2011, UNESCO adopted the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) recommendation and called for the application of a landscape approach to ensure the integration of cultural heritage policies and management concerns in the wider goals of sustainable urban development. This paper tracks the genesis of a landscape approach to heritage conservation, and then presents a systematic review of the literature on the HUL. More than 100 publications from 2010 to early 2018 were analysed. The applied methodology combined an inductive categorization method with a deductive data mining method. The objective is to determine whether the academic discussion is addressing the different dimensions of the HUL approach, including the holistic, integrated, and value-based dimensions, and whether it is progressing through time to move from a conceptual to an operational level. Results show that while the discussion is heavily focused on values, the operationalization of a value-based approach is still lacking, as it is not fully contextualized in relation to local heritage discourses and the dynamics of heritage governance. Results also show that many case studies applications are in 'non-Western' cities, thus opening the debate about the accountability of a value-based approach in contexts that tend to be dominated by groups with the most political power, and where conservation practices mainly focus on the mobilization of material heritage to foster its economic value. Nevertheless, the transition from international guidelines to contextualized local endeavours and policies remains a challenge to be solved.

AB  - Lay Summary Reports regarding sex heterogenicity in acute aortic dissection (AAD) are not exhaustive and in part even conflicting. Sex differences in clinical features, management, and outcomes were investigated among patients with type A AAD through a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature. A female sex phenotype appears to be evident in type A AAD implying the need for a personalized management patient approach along with tailored preventive strategies. Interestingly, while in-hospital surgical mortality did not differ between sexes, 5- and 10-year survival was higher among men. In the near future, definitive sex-specific data from international clinical registries and trials are expected.
   Background In acute aortic dissection (AAD) sex heterogeneity reports are not exhaustive and in part even conflicting. Aims To explore sex differences in clinical features, management, and outcomes among patients with type A AAD. Methods and results A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature were conducted for studies (2004-2022) reporting type A AAD sex differences. Among the 1938 studies retrieved, 16 (16 069 patients, 7142 women, and 8927 men) fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Data were aggregated used the random-effects model as pooled risk ratio and mean difference. Due to information reported by considered manuscripts, analysis were performed only among surgically treated type A AAD patients. At the time of hospital presentation type A AAD women were older than men but had lower body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), and creatinine plasma levels. Active smoking, bicuspid aortic valve, and previous cardiac surgery were less common in women while diabetes mellitus was more frequent. Furthermore, women experienced more frequently pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade than men. Interestingly, in-hospital surgical mortality did not differ between sexes [risk ratio (RR), 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-1.99; P = 0.95], whereas 5 (RR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97; P < 0.001) and 10-year survival (RR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74-0.92; P = 0.004) was higher among men. A descriptive analysis of in-hospital outcomes among medically treated type A AAD patients confirmed prohibitive high mortality for both sexes (men 58.6% vs. women 53.8%, P = 0.59). Conclusions A female sex phenotype appears to be evident in type A AAD implying the need for a personalized management patient approach along with tailored preventive strategies.

AB  - The raising cost and relative shortage of the conventional feedstuffs drive the livestock husbandry to seek alternative feed ingredients, most of which are rich in dietary fibers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in the current study to explore quantitative patterns of nitrogen emission and nutrient digestibility of pigs fed dietary fiber at different inclusion levels, and to investigate prospects of using biological enzymes to solve some problems brought by high-fiber consumption in swine industry. The results showed that the fecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emission after dietary fiber ingestion by growing pigs could be predicted by the following models: Fecal N output, g/d = 0.28 x NDF, % + 2.65, and Urine N output, g/d = 11.24-0.25 x ADF, %, and the nitrogen excretion is shifted from urine as urea to feces as bacterial protein when fibrous feedstuffs are included in diets of growing pigs (Urine N output: Fecal N output = 2.87-0.10 x NDF, % + 0.0053 x NDF, %2). However, increased dietary fiber supplementation in swine diets decreases energy and phosphorous digestibility, resulting in excess emission of minerals and soil and water pollution. In practice, biological enzymes supplementation can be an effective approach to compensate negative effects of high amounts of dietary fibers on energy digestibility and phosphorous emission in pig production. Both pros and cons of dietary fiber supplementation on balanced nutrition supply and farm environment sustainability in pig production are systematically summarized, and it is imperative to standardize the utilization of fibrous ingredients in swine industry.

AB  - Research background: The services provided by ecosystems are the main support for human populations and for the development of any type of activity. Today, the provision of these ser-vices is under threat. The economic valuation of ecosystem services is vital to design appropriate policies, define strategies and manage ecosystems.Purpose of the article: The objective of this study is to analyse the evolution of research on the economic valuation of ecosystem services over the last two decades. More specifically, it aims firstly to identify the main agents driving research and, secondly, it seeks to synthesize in a single document the relevant information on the main economic valuation methods, relating them to the categories of services, ecosystems and regions where they have been employed.Methods: A quantitative review was first carried out through a bibliometric analysis to identify the main drivers of this line of research and its development trends. Secondly, a qualitative review was conducted through a systematic review focusing on the most commonly used valuation tech-niques in relation to the characteristics of the service, the geographical scope and the ecosystem analysed.Findings & value added: The main novelty of this work, compared to previous literature, is that the relationship between the study area, the type of ecosystem, the category of service and the economic valuation methodology are analysed for the first time. The results highlight the need to continue expanding knowledge in relation to the temporal and spatial scale in the economic value of ecosystem services, the subjective nature of the estimates and the heterogeneity between the different social sectors with respect to the benefit obtained.

AB  - This systematic literature review identifies and critiques methodological trends in green gentrification research (focusing on studies of vegetative greening) and provides suggestions for advancing this field. Findings reveal (1) research has largely focused on U.S. case studies; (2) early work employed qualitative methods but quantitative analyses have become more common; (3) little attention has been paid to the influence of greening characteristics/functions and non-greening factors on gentrification; (4) the mechanisms through which greening leads to gentrification are not well understood, particularly on the demand side; and (5) despite being the main concern of green gentrification, displacement has not been well-documented.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the main complications of diabetes, and the management of the main control parameters explains only an 11% reduction in the risk of progressing to DR, leaving 89% to be explained by other factors or correlations between the usual factors that are currently unknown. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the similarities and differences between the possible risk factors for developing DR when comparing the world to Latin American populations. The search was performed first for Latin American (LA) populations and a second search for non-Latin American (Non-LA) populations. Using the PRISMA guidelines, five articles were found to be relevant for each of the groups. The patients who had elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) developed DR more frequently than the patients without retinopathy (Z = 2.1, p = 0.03), an effect measured in the population at a global level (GL), behavior that becomes not significant when the LA and non-LA populations are grouped separately; relevant to this is that the diagnosis of hypertension (HBP) grouped globally and stratified does not present a risk factor for DR (Z = 0.79, p = 0.42). This indicates that SBP is a risk factor for the world population and that, by separating it into different regions, the omission could cause it not to be considered a possible risk factor. In conclusion, the relationship between the increase in DR associated with the risk factors present in different populations, the limited research conducted in Latin America, and the cultural, social, economic, and genetic differences makes for a complex condition, which reflects the necessity of researching in a more integrated way.

AB  - Currently, developing countries are experiencing a massive shift toward industrialization. Developing countries lack the technical sophistication and infrastructure to encourage low-carbon and sustainable economic growth because of weak public awareness, regulations, and technology. Developing countries must plan the industrialization process for maximum energy efficiency of production, thereby reducing their CO textsubscript 2 emissions significantly by increasing energy efficiency. This paper presents a systematic survey on the current pragmatic methods for forecasting the future load demands from minutes to years ahead in developing countries, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The primary focus of this systematic survey paper is to provide an optimal forecasting model selection strategy for potential researchers and forecasters. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the different models, we will discuss the most suitable methods to tailor them to multiple applications and scenarios of load forecasting. The comparison elements are Forecast horizons, Spatio-temporal resolutions, factors affecting the load, different dimensional reduction techniques, model complexity analysis, and the MAPE for error analysis. From the results, We have found ANN hybridized with meta-heuristic techniques to be superior in most of the analysis cases. ANN's ability to handle non-linear data, flexibility, and robustness is why. Consumption data aggregated at the national level can capture trends efficiently. Meteorological and calendar features influence short-term forecasting extensively, whereas economic factors influence long-term load patterns. Finally, we have identified the trends and research gaps from the existing literature, presenting relevant technical recommendations for improvement.

AB  - Background and Aim Intragastric botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection is a potential treatment for weight reduction in obese patients. Current studies yielded conflicting results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of intragastric BTA injection for weight management. Methods We searched several databases to identify RCTs evaluating intragastric BTA injections for obesity. We applied random-effects models for all meta-analyses due to heterogeneity in the included studies. The mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes. Results A total of 6 RCTs including 192 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were included for the meta-analysis. Although the pooled data from six studies showed no difference in the absolute weight loss between intragastric BTA injection and control, subgroup analysis showed a significantly decreased absolute weight after a BTA injection dose >= 200 U (MD, -2.04 kg; 95% CI, -3.96 to -0.12) and after multiple injection regions in the stomach combined with diet control (MD, -4.44 kg; 95% CI, -6.54 to -2.33 kg) compared with the control. Regarding absolute weight loss, the impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection and follow-up duration showed no difference. Intragastric BTA injection had a significant change in body mass index (MD, -1.25 kg/m(2); 95% CI, -2.18 to -0.32 kg/m(2)) and prolonged gastric half-emptying time (MD, 11.37 min; 95% CI, -3.69 to 19.06 min). Conclusion Intragastric BTA injection is effective for obesity treatment, and adequate doses (>= 200 U), multiple gastric injection regions, and combined diet control are crucial. However, given the small sample size and limited power, caution should be exercised.

AB  - CONTEXT: There is a growing consensus that agriculture, forestry, and livestock integration (agroforestry systems) could assist South Asia in combating food insecurity by expediting the transition towards sustainability. However, there is a dearth of a comprehensive synthesis of evidence demonstrating the actual relevance of this nexus to agroecological development and farmers' food security in South Asia-the majority of whom are smallholders with limited assets.OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potentiality of the South Asian agroforestry systems- as a viable agroecological approach for ensuring farmers' food security: food availability, access, utilization, and stability.METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following the guidelines provided by the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) to achieve the study objective. The Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection databases were used, along with Google Scholar as an additional database, to gather relevant articles for the review.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the 95 studies reviewed, only nine explicitly focused on food security, and none of them examined all four dimensions of food security simultaneously. Moreover, the skewed distribution of studies towards the Himalayan belt and a lack of quantitative measurement make it challenging to determine the

AB  - Agricultural systems support societies in various ways but also cause substantial sustainability challenges. Sustainable agricultural practices are key to achieving sustainability targets, yet we lack generalizable knowl-edge on why farmers apply such practices. Here, we quantified the relationship between farmers' adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and their underlying motivational factors. Based on a systematic review, we meta-analyzed 14 motivational factors from 225 studies reporting 522 effect sizes, representing 327,778 farmers from 23 European countries. We found (1) substantially stronger positive effects for general attitude, intention and perceived usefulness compared with economic outcomes and environmental awareness, (2) dissonance between intention and actual behavior, and (3) geographic, thematic, and effort-effect bias in literature. Stimulating the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices hence requires reconsidering the currently strong emphasis on economic factors in favor of a wider set of motivational factors, especially by addressing socio-psychological factors via transparency, communication, and training.

AB  - Private forest owners are the main forest ownership group within Europe, and important conservation values have been found on their land. Yet, small plot sizes, societal heterogeneity, and structural changes impede developing and implementing effective conservation programs in private forests. We present a systematic literature review focusing on small-scale private forest owners and their perspectives on nature conservation by synthesizing research approaches, social-ecological drivers, and policy recommendations. Conservation perspectives were positively related to female gender, higher levels of education, formalized forest management, an active relation to the forest, and ecological values of the property. In contrast, high age, rural orientation, economic forest management factors, large parcel size, and economic and sentimental property values negatively influenced conservation perspectives. Applying a natural resource conflict management framework, we synthesized recommendations covering three dimensions: substance, procedure, relationship. Considering perspectives of small-scale private forest owners in current forestry decision-making has great potential to strengthen sustainable forest management that integrates nature conservation and resource use.

AB  - In an era characterized by severe climate change, dwindling resources, and a growing world population, the agricultural industry is facing unprecedented challenges. On the other hand, overuse of natural resources has emerged as a major concern worldwide. Greenhouses (GHs) have been developed as central environments capable of growing a diverse range of high-quality agricultural products throughout the year, regardless of external weather conditions. However, conventional GHs often impose significant costs on energy resources for their heating and cooling operations, thus presenting sustainability challenges. To address these pressing concerns, using new smart technologies as well as the integration and development of renewable energy sources, including photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WT), and geothermal systems, have gained momentum. This integration not only increases the ecological footprint of GHs but also reduces their dependence on conventional energy sources. Furthermore, the adoption of smart GH technologies, characterized by advanced control and automation systems, holds significant promise in energy optimization and efficiency. Hence, this systematic review attempts to carefully examine the optimal and practical methods that include the design, fabrication, control, energy management, and operation of smart GHs. This review includes an in-depth analysis of GH structures, building materials, cooling and heating systems, new dark GH concepts, and smart lighting systems. In addition, it addresses effective strategies to curb energy consumption in smart GHs. By synthesizing and synthesizing existing research and practical experiences, this paper seeks to provide valuable insights and recommendations to facilitate the efficient and sustainable design, construction, and operation of smart GHs. Ultimately, this work aims to promote resource-efficient and environmentally conscious practices in the agricultural energy sector.

AB  - Protecting tropical forests and their biological diversity is a global priority. Understanding if thresholds of forest cover exist beyond which biodiversity displays non-linear declines is key to developing appropriate conservation strategies and policies, but uncertainty remains around the identification and characteristics of these thresholds. We performed a global systematic review of studies using forest cover gradient to identify an ecological threshold across tropical forest ecosystems. Our systematic review finds 68 ecological thresholds reported in 33 peer-reviewed publications. Three main conclusions emerged: first, we show clear geographical gaps in ecological thresholds studies, with 72% of reported thresholds found in South America, over half in Brazil; second, we see ecological threshold studies follow taxonomic biases in line with wider conservation research; and third, there is a lack of homogeneity and comparability in the metrics and sampling designs used to identify a threshold. This global review shows interest in ecological thresholds continues to grow, but further evidence is needed to understand their application in tropical forest management. We identify the main gaps in knowledge and provide guidance to focus research efforts on six key aspects to better understand their potential as a policy-making tool for tropical forest conservation.

AB  - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender (GLBT) employees constitute one of the largest, but least studied minority groups in the workforce. Given the scarcity of an up to date systematic literature review on sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace since Croteau (1996) and Ward (2003), this study aims to fill this gap through systematic literature review based on rigorous criteria. By examining 52 selected papers, the study specifically attempts to systematize the existing literature, explore key emerging themes and recent developments, identify research gaps, and suggest potential areas for future research. As a result, 'coming out', 'wage inequality', 'GLBT employee groups', 'the effects of GLBT (non) discrimination on the workplace and business outcomes' were identified as the major themes of the current review. Social institutions, legal frameworks, and cultural norms were determined as the key pillars of sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (C) The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to point out the advances in political ecology studies on hydroelectric power plants. For this purpose, a systematic review methodology of scientific literature was used, resulting in important reflections on four topics: accumulation processes linked to the development of hydroelectric projects; socio-environmental conflicts originated in disputes over rural territories; resistance mechanisms of affected rural communities; and institutional governance to manage conflicts. It is concluded that it is necessary to address territorial inequities of structural origin, which are deepened by the implementation of hydroelectric projects.

AB  - Rooted in different theories and focusing on different elements of the socio-ecological fabric, climate transitions and transformations are conceived to have various forms. Although these literatures recognize the significance of learning and boundary spanning, systematic reviews of the role of knowledge in climate transitions are lacking. We review how targets of transformation, functions, types, and intermediaries of knowledge are conceptualized in five types of literature. We highlight that knowledge has a role as: the motor of transition in Transition Management literature, a consultant supporting transition in Transformational Climate Adaptation literature, an emancipator of transition in Transform Political and Economic Systems literature, the beacon guiding transition in Social-Ecological Transformation literature, and an Ad Hoc Committee motivating transition in Grassroots Transitions literature.

AB  - Background: Adolescents living with chronic illnesses engage in health risk behaviors (HRB) which pose challenges for optimizing care and management of their ill health. Frequent monitoring of HRB is recommended, however little is known about which are the most useful tools to detect HRB among chronically ill adolescents.
   Aims: This systematic review was conducted to address important knowledge gaps on the assessment of HRB among chronically ill adolescents. Its specific aims were to: identify HRB assessment tools, the geographical location of the studies, their means of administration, the psychometric properties of the tools and the commonest forms of HRB assessed among adolescents living with chronic illnesses globally.
   Methods: We searched in four bibliographic databases of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts for empirical studies published until April 2017 on HRB among chronically ill adolescents aged 10-17 years.
   Results: This review indicates a major dearth of research on HRB among chronically ill adolescents especially in low income settings. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and Health Behavior in School-aged Children were the commonest HRB assessment tools. Only 21% of the eligible studies reported psychometric properties of the HRB tools or items. Internal consistency was good and varied from 0.73 to 0.98 whereas test-retest reliability varied from unacceptable (0.58) to good (0.85). Numerous methods of tool administration were also identified. Alcohol, tobacco and other drug use and physical inactivity are the commonest forms of HRB assessed.
   Conclusion: Evidence on the suitability of the majority of the HRB assessment tools has so far been documented in high income settings where most of them have been developed. The utility of such tools in low resource settings is often hampered by the cultural and contextual variations across regions. The psychometric qualities were good but only reported in a minority of studies from high income settings. This result points to the need for more resources and capacity building for tool adaptation and validation, so as to enhance research on HRB among chronically ill adolescents in low resource settings.

AB  - Purpose A comprehensive understanding of the determining factors and implications of the frameworks for appreciating the relationships between climate risks and cultural heritage remains deficient. To address the gap, the review analysed literature on the management of climate risk in cultural heritage. The review examines the strengths and weaknesses of climate risk management (CRM) frameworks and attendant implications for the conservation of cultural heritage.Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a two-phased systematic review procedure. In the first phase, the authors reviewed related publications published between 2017 and 2021 in Scopus and Google Scholar. Key reports published by organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) were identified and included in Phase Two to further understand approaches to CRM in cultural heritage.Findings Results established the changes in trend and interactions between factors influencing the adoption of CRM frameworks, including methods and tools for CRM. There is also increasing interest in adopting quantitative and qualitative methods using highly technical equipment and software to assess climate risks to cultural heritage assets. However, climate risk information is largely collected at the national and regional levels rather than at the cultural heritage asset.Practical implications The review establishes increasing implementation of CRM frameworks across national boundaries at place level using high-level technical skills and knowledge, which are rare amongst local organisations and professionals involved in cultural heritage management.Originality/value The review established the need for multi-sectoral, bottom-up and place-based approaches to improve the identification of climate risks and decision-making processes for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Preconception care (PCC) increases the chance of couple's being healthy and having a healthier baby. It is an important strategy to prevent maternal and perinatal complications. The level of knowledge on preconception care increases its uptake. It is also considered as an input for further intervention of reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality enabling progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs). Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled knowledge level of PCC and its association with family planning usage among women in Ethiopia. All observational studies regardless of publication status were retrieved. Important search terms were used to search articles in Google scholar, African Journals Online, CINHAL, HINARI, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed/Medline. Independent critical appraisal of retrieved studies was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa assessment checklist. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 14 software. The I-2 statistics were used to test heterogeneity, whereas publication bias was assessed by Begg's and Egger's tests. The results of the meta-analysis were explained in the Odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and presented using forest plots. A total of seven articles were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis. Based on the data retrieved from the articles, 35.7% of women in Ethiopia had good knowledge about preconception care. The subgroup analysis based on region revealed the lowest (22.34%) and highest (45.06%) percentage of good knowledge on preconception care among women who were living in Amhara and Oromia regions, respectively. Moreover, women who utilized family planning services were three and more times (OR 3.65 (95% CI 2.11, 6.31)) more likely to have a good level of knowledge about preconception care. One-third of Ethiopian women had good knowledge about preconception care. Family planning utilization had a positive impact on women's knowledge of preconception care.

AB  - The identification of sustainable fertilisation practices is essential to reduce agriculture's impact on the environment while insuring sufficient crop production. The use of enhanced efficiency fertilisers (EEFs) is thought to improve nitrogen (N)-fertiliser uptake by crops while reducing nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs' performance has been assessed in several meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which are heterogeneous in content and quality of reporting. This provides fragmented information and makes it difficult to conclude about their ability to provide more sustainable fertilisation. Here we synthetise evidence from 26 meta-analyses and reviews selected by a systematic literature search to describe the separate effects of four commonly used EEFs-nitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, double inhibitors, or controlled-release fertilisers-on the environment, nutrient use efficiency, soil fertility, and crop production. A unique contribution of this review is the assessment of the quality of the selected papers and the synthesis of their results through a systematic framework. Results showed that compared to conventional fertilisers, EEFs generally increased soil nutrients, crop yield, and N use efficiency, and reduced N leaching, emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Some differences were found between the different EEFs; while urease inhibitors, double inhibitors, and controlled-released fertilisers decreased ammonia emission compared to conventional fertilisers, nitrification inhibitors increased these emissions or did not affect them. The results were consistent when excluding low-quality studies from the analyses. Overall, this global synthesis indicates that EEFs could maintain crop yields while reducing some of the negative environmental impacts of conventional N-fertilisers. Attention should be paid to the potential increase of ammonia emissions by nitrification inhibitors and additional evidence is needed on the potential side effects on soil health, biodiversity, and water quality.

AB  - Introduction: tourism is an element that has a significant contribution to the development and renewal of cities and, according to the Parana Tourist Plan 2026 (Plano Parana Turistico 2026), a new approach to intelligent destinations on the temporal and spatial behavior of tourists using new tracking or counting technologies can serve as a key factor to improve the sustainable management of tourism. Following this trend, this study seeks to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the topic of tourist movement, aiming to classify the most widely used. Method: systematic literature review, analyzing scientific publications in the databases of ACM, IEEE Science Direct and Scopus journals in the last 5 years. Results: 761 articles were found, of which 47 were selected for reading and data extraction, and then the most cited technologies in the literature were classified and generated, where the technologies used in each article are presented. Topics such as: technologies for tracking and counting tourists, smart tourism. information technology, management and sustainability are highlighted in the surveys. Conclusion: the present study served to answer the question: "What are the most used technologies to track tourists?", therefore, it can be said that the objective of this study was achieved classifying the 5 main technologies most used: GPS. Applications, Sensors, Social Media and RHO followed by others of equal relevance for further studies. It was found that the technologies raised, in their majority, are free technologies, in which it is possible to develop innovative projects with low execution cost.

AB  - Importance: Telemedicine has been shown to be an efficient and effective means of providing care to patients with chronic disease especially in remote and undeserved regions, by improving access to care and reduce healthcare cost. However, the evidence surrounding its applicability in type 1 diabetes remains scarce and conflicting.
   Objective: To synthesize evidence and quantify the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions for the management of glycemic and clinical outcomes in type 1 diabetes patients, relative to comparator conditions.
   Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for published articles since inception until December 2016.
   Study Selection: Original articles reporting the results of randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of telemedicine in people with type 1 diabetes were included.
   Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed quality, and strength of evidence. Interventions were categorized based upon the telemedicine focus (monitoring, education, consultation, case-management, and peer mentoring).
   Main Outcome and Measure: Absolute change in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to follow-up assessment.
   Results: A total of 38 studies described in 41 articles were identified. Positive effects on glycemic control were noted with studies examining telemedicine, with a mean reduction of 0.18% at the end of intervention. Studies with longer duration (>6 months) who had recruited patients with a higher baseline HbA1c (>= 9%) were associated with larger effects. Telemedicine interventions that involve individualized assessments, audit with feedback and skill building were also more effective in improving glycemic control. However, no benefits were observed on blood pressure, lipids, weight, quality of life, and adverse events.
   Conclusions and Relevance: There is insufficient evidence to support telemedicine use for glycemic control and other clinically relevant outcome among patients with type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Savannas are commonly described as a vegetation type with a grass layer interspersed with a discontinuous tree or shrub layer. On the contrary, forbs, a plant life form that can include any nongraminoid herbaceous vascular plant, are poorly represented in definitions of savannas worldwide. While forbs have been acknowledged as a diverse component of the herbaceous layer in savanna ecosystems and valued for the ecosystem services and functions they provide, they have not been the primary focus in most savanna vegetation studies. We performed a systematic review of scientific literature to establish the extent to which forbs are implicitly or explicitly considered as a discrete vegetation component in savanna research. The overall aims were to summarize knowledge on forb ecology, identify knowledge gaps, and derive new perspectives for savanna research and management with a special focus on arid and semiarid ecosystems in Africa. We synthesize and discuss our findings in the context of different overarching research themes: (a) functional organization and spatial patterning, (b) land degradation and range management, (c) conservation and reserve management, (d) resource use and forage patterning, and (e) germination and recruitment. Our results revealed biases in published research with respect to study origin (country coverage in Africa), climate (more semiarid than arid systems), spatial scale (more local than landscape scale), the level at which responses or resource potential was analyzed (primarily plant functional groups rather than species), and the focus on interactions between life forms (rather seldom between forbs and grasses and/or trees). We conclude that the understanding of African savanna community responses to drivers of global environmental change requires knowledge beyond interactions between trees and grasses only and beyond the plant functional group level. Despite multifaceted evidence of our current understanding of forbs in dry savannas, there appear to be knowledge gaps, specifically in linking drivers of environmental change to forb community responses. We therefore propose that more attention be given to forbs as an additional ecologically important plant life form in the conventional tree-grass paradigm of savannas.

AB  - Significant progress has been made in the research on variations in HRM across national boundaries, in both the quantity of studies and theoretical advancements since the mid-1980s. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of existing literature on cross-country comparative studies of HRM as an important strand of the international HRM field in order to shed new light on dominant key concerns and themes, and emerging syntheses. More specifically, we conducted a systematic review of cross-country comparative HRM studies published in academic journals in the English language in the 15-year period of 2000-2014. Our paper charted the development of cross-country comparative studies of HRM as a sub-field of HRM research. Our analysis of 125 articles from 30 business and management journals shows the countries/regions that have been studied, topics, and research methods used. We also highlight a number of research avenues for further study in this field. Although there are a number of distinct strands to the literature, our study concludes that there is an emerging common ground in underlying concerns and theoretical assumptions both within the field, and with other areas of management inquiry.

AB  - Smart cities connect humans to networks of information to create urban operating systems that optimize traffic management, sustainable energy use, and enact smart governance. The concept of playable cities has been advanced to create smart cities that are more human-centered. As smart cities are socio-technical structures involving technologies, people, and policies that each impact privacy and security, such an approach also has potential to develop stronger cybersecurity protocols for smart cities going beyond technological approaches. In this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of articles from 2015 to 2020 that discuss smart/playable cities and data gathering in relation to privacy and security. Based on this systematic review, we found a disconnect exists between smart and playable cities literature in terms of exclusive focus on technological solutions for security and little focus on people and policies as part of cybersecurity in the literature analyzed. Seeing as playable cities embrace user-generated co-creation, we argue that this personal side is important to get people to participate meaningfully in smart cities that lets them embrace cybersecurity policies as part of personal behavior. For this purpose, we propose utilizing a cybersecurity lens (e.g., McCumber cube model) so that smart city designers can more fully develop and consider cybersecurity that includes both personal privacy and playable approaches.

AB  - The ambidexterity concept is largely used in the strategic management field. However, little is known about its use in travel, tourism, hospitality, leisure, and event research. This study offers not only the first comprehensive analysis of the use of this concept but also a rationale for why it should be more widely used in travel, tourism, hospitality, leisure, and event research. The results show that (1) ambidexterity is scarcely used by researchers, (2) most papers are based on empirical data, and (3) all empirical studies were done either in Europe or in Asia. Moreover, scholars have focused on three main outcomes: sustainability, human resources performance, and market performance. This review allowed us to advance suggestions for practice and Mire research.

AB  - Australian cities have experienced a high number of floods and droughts. In Australia, green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly popular in considering natural processes in sustainable water management practices. However, to date, there has been little examination of how the academic literature has addressed the use of GI in Australian landscape planning for water management. To investigate this, we applied a thematic framework and used the PRISMA approach to identify and analyse 98 peer-reviewed papers to better understand whether and how landscape planning perspectives are considered in current water management approaches in Australia. We found a recent increase in Australian-based literature related to GI for water management. However, there is limited literature discussing the significance of landscape connectivity and the multi-functionality of GI. This article concludes with recommendations for future research on the landscape planning principles of multi-functionality, landscape connectivity, and the integration of multiple scales of GI in Australian urban water management.

AB  - Estuaries are productive ecosystems providing important habitat for a diversity of species, yet they also experience intense levels of anthropogenic development. To inform decision-making, it is essential to understand the pathways of impacts of particular human activities, especially those that affect species such as salmon, which have high ecological, social-cultural and economic values. Salmon systems provide an opportunity to build from the substantial body of research on responses to estuary developments and take stock of what is known. We conducted a systematic English-language literature review on the responses of juvenile salmon to anthropogenic activities in estuaries and nearshore areas asking: what has been studied, where are the major knowledge gaps and how do stressors affect salmon? We found a substantial body of research (n = 167 studies; 1,369 comparative tests) to help understand responses of juvenile salmon to 24 activities and their 14 stressors. Across studies, 82% of the research was conducted in the eastern Pacific (Oregon and Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada) showing a limited geographical scope. Using a semiquantitative approach to summarize the literature, including a weight-of-evidence metric, we found a range of results from low to moderate-high confidence in the consequences of the stressors. For example, we found moderate-high confidence in the negative impacts of pollutants and sea lice and moderate confidence in negative impacts from connectivity loss and changes in flow. Our results suggest that overall, multiple anthropogenic activities cause negative impacts across ecological scales. However, our results also reveal knowledge gaps resulting from minimal research on particular species (e.g. sockeye salmon), regions (e.g. Atlantic) or stressors (e.g. entrainment) that would be expedient areas for future research. With estuaries acting as a nexus of biological and societal importance and hotspots of ongoing development, the insights gained here can contribute to informed decision-making.

AB  - Improvements in and the assessment of land use efficiency are crucial pillars for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study reviews 208 representative papers, oral reports, and project reports to provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the current status and future trends of research on land use efficiency assessment. The findings reveal that (1) the number of papers on land use efficiency assessment is rapidly increasing, with research primarily focused on environmental science and ecology (n = 157, 75.48%). (2) Quantitative models are gaining popularity for land use efficiency assessment, with more than 46.63% of the studies adopting the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. (3) The definition and analysis perspectives of land use efficiency are diverse, but research on relative land use efficiency and comprehensive analysis perspectives accounts for a significant proportion. (4) Constructing a large and complex model that incorporates geospatial effects, big data, and computer technology is a hot topic for future research methods. On the other hand, conducting land use efficiency research on a global scale is more conducive to achieving the SDGs. (5) The core to improving land use efficiency lies in the joint implementation of multi-pronged measures.

AB  - Background: Dementia is a challenging neurodegenerative disease. This systematic review aimed to summarize natural, physical, and social environmental factors that are associated with age-related cognitive impairment and dementia.
   Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsychINFO till January 11, 2021 for observational studies. The hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR), and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence in-terval (CI) were aggregated using random-effects methods. The quality of evidence for each association was evaluated.
   Results: Of the 48,399 publications identified, there were 185 suitable for review across 44 environmental factors. Meta-analyses were performed for 22 factors. With high-to-moderate quality of evidence, risks were suggested in exposure to PM2.5 (HR=1.24, 95%CI: 1.17-1.31), NO2 (HR=1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.12), aluminum (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.14-1.59), solvents (OR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.07-1.22), road proximity (OR=1.08, 95%CI: 1.04-1.12) and other air pollutions, yet more frequent social contact (HR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.76-0.90) and more greenness (OR=0.97, 95%CI: 0.95-0.995) were protective. With low-to-very low quality, electromagnetic fields, pesticides, SO2, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and rural living were suggested risks, but more community cultural engagement might be protective. No significant associations were observed in exposure to PM10, NOx, noise, silicon, community group, and temperature. For the remaining 22 factors, only a descriptive analysis was un-dertaken as too few studies or lack of information.
   Conclusions: This review highlights that air pollutions, especially PM2.5 and NO2 play important role in the risk for age- related cognitive impairment and dementia.

AB  - Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the major complications of diabetes, representing a leading cause of hospitalization and non-traumatic lower limb amputations. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are statements that include recommendations intended to improve patients' outcomes by providing recommendations for key clinical issues with alternative care options. The aim of this study is to systematically review CPGs on DFUs care and generate an evidence-map for visualizing research trends and gaps in the CPGs.
   Methods: A search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, guideline databases and website of diabetes society was performed to include the diabetic CPGs. We exacted the basic information, methodological quality and reporting quality of CPGs, recommendations for DFUs care by the Excel 2016. Four researchers evaluated the methodological and reporting quality of diabetic foot CPGs by AGREE II instrument and RIGHT checklist. The bubble plot format of evidence map was reduced by R (3.5.1) software.
   Results: 22 CPGs proved eligible, which included 10 diabetic foot guidelines and 12 comprehensive diabetes guidelines. According to the recommendations of diabetic CPGs, current standard of care for DFUs care mainly involves offloading of pressure, wound care, choice of shoes and adjunctive treatment. Recommendations on offloading of pressure and wound care were consistent in 22 CPGs. However, there were some conflicts on adjunctive treatment recommendations and recommendations for choice of shoes were not accurate.
   Conclusion: There is mixed quality evidence of CPGs for DFUs care, and some recommendations are inconsistent. This evidence map could provide new perspectives in presentation of evidence and help us know the need for future research to address the current gaps, as well as areas of opportunity for CPG development.

AB  - In developing countries, urbanisation and associated demographic changes pose unprecedented challenges in terms of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. A systematic review methodology was conducted, combined with data synthesis, to examine the interactions between urban sprawl, land and resource use changes, agricultural production and food security in developing countries. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched to identify 188 relevant articles. The results revealed that existing literature has widely failed to take interactions between different aspects of urban food systems (UFS) into account, indicating disconnects and fragmentation in the approaches used to analyse these interactions. Therefore a further focus on food system transformation pathways, system feedbacks and trade-offs is recommended. Moreover, the results imply that UFS are complex interlinked systems and therefore that policies intending to assure food security in developing countries need to consider these interlinkages and approach them holistically. Finally, an absence of studies examining urban and rural systems from an interconnected perspective was identified. An acknowledgement of such rural-urban connectivity gaps is crucial in order to ensure more inclusive links within food systems and agricultural value chains, and achieve more resilient food systems and more sustainable urbanisation in developing countries.

AB  - This study was conducted to review the literature on full truckload (FTL) transportation service procurement and to identify the gaps from the perspectives of researchers and practitioners. FTL procurement in particular was reviewed because it is encountered more than others forms of procurement in freight movement, and it involves numerous challenges. A framework was developed to provide a systematic review of the literature, the findings of which are discussed in detail. Some key findings include the simplistic assumption of demand patterns, limited focus on non-price variables, a limited number of case studies, less consideration of sustainability aspects, and a lack of detailed studies on emerging economies.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of publications on organizational reputation in the public administration throughout the last two decades, no systematic review has been conducted to synthesize the current state of the literature. This article contributes to this issue by bringing together empirical and theoretical academic research-119 articles and seven books-to analyze five critical aspects of this scholarship: conceptualization, types implemented, antecedents, outcomes, and multidimensionality. This work provides an overview of the field while identifying five critical areas for further research: reputational audiences, public leaders' impact on reputation, development of typologies based on the characteristics of reputation, the use of standardized methods to conduct more cross-country studies, and research on a wider variety of cultural and organizational contexts.

AB  - The study and assessment of ecosystem services through remote sensing has increased substantially over the last two decades, as evidenced by the publication of studies that have applied it. The technological development of satellite images has improved in terms of spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution, allowing the space-time observation, classification and monitoring of vegetation on the surface of the Earth. However, there are remaining methodological challenges for assessing ecosystem services due to the diversity of applications, the resources used, and its study in complex environments such as cities. This systematic review is based on identifying and analysing the variety of methods concerning the application of remote sensing for the assessment of ecosystem services provided by vegetation in cities, through a classification of these methods according to the data collection source (passive sensors, passive and active sensors and the fusion of other data sources with sensors). The classification of methods has been applied to a selection of existing articles in indexed scientific databases based on a non-statistical meta-analysis that make a direct reference to the topic of interest. The results show the approaches found in every method classified, their relationships with the geographical scale and the image resolutions used, and the advantages and limitations from the data processes that comprise remote sensing. We conclude from this analysis with three key factors to consider in the selection of remote sensing methods for the assessment of ecosystem services provided by urban vegetation: the definition of the approach (es), the urban scale to be assessed, and the image resolution available.

AB  - The paper aims to identify and analyze what types of governance challenges for sustainable regional development in the context of globalization are more frequently found in scholarship regarding Latin America. In order to do so, we carried out a systematic review of scholarly works discussing regional sustainability issues across the region. Analytically, it provides a heuristic multidimensional framework for organizing and typifying the most frequent sustainable regional development governance challenges under study, offering a nuanced and interrelated account of economic, environmental, political, and socio-spatial scientific discussions. According to our findings, scholarship on Latin America shows a bricolage-like scenery where political atomization linked to economic factionalism and fragmentation stand out as frequently analyzed situations. Another frequent topic relates to discussions about political endeavors linked to environmental concerns, connecting incidence strategies with collective environmental conservation approaches.

AB  - Climate change strongly impacts the agricultural sector in West Africa, threatening food security and nutrition, particularly for populations with the least adaptive capacity. Little is known about national climate change policies in the region. This systematic review identifies and analyses climate change policy documents in all 16 West African countries: (1) What are the existing climate change adaptation policies publicly available? (2) Which topics are addressed? (3) How are agriculture and food security framed and addressed? Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed and Google scholar as key databases were searched with an extensive grey literature search. Keywords for searches were combinations of "Africa", "Climate Change", and "National Policy/Plan/Strategy/Guideline". Fifteen countries have at least one national policy document on climate change in the frame of our study. Nineteen policy documents covered seven key sectors (energy, agriculture, water resources, health, forestry, infrastructure, and education), and eight thematic areas (community resilience, disaster risk management, institutional development, industry development, research and development, policy making, economic investment, and partnerships/collaboration). At the intersection of these sectors/areas, effects of changing climate on countries/populations were evaluated and described. Climate change adaptation strategies emerged including development of local risk/disaster plans, micro-financing and insurance schemes (public or private), green energy, and development of community groups/farmers organizations. No clear trend emerged when analysing the adaptation options, however, climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector was almost always included. Analysing agriculture, nutrition, and food security, seven agricultural challenges were identified: The small scale of West African farming, information gaps, missing infrastructure, poor financing, weak farmer/community organizations, a shifting agricultural calendar, and deteriorating environmental ecology. They reflect barriers to adaptation especially for small-scale subsistence farmers with increased climate change vulnerabilities. The study has shown that most West African countries have climate change policies. Nevertheless, key questions remain unanswered, and demand for further research, e.g., on evaluating the implementation in the respective countries, persists.

AB  - Unimproved neutral grasslands have declined in extent throughout Europe, especially in Britain. Some of the surviving fragments are managed as pasture but the grazing regime required to maintain their relict flora is unproven. We conducted a systematic review and analysed available data to ascertain the impact of grazing on species richness and the abundance of important plant species. We found the evidence base to be poor but with some potential for meaningful integration of existing datasets. Analyses of complementary datasets from Welsh mesotrophic grassland demonstrates that livestock type and vegetation height significantly impact on the plant community composition. However, the differences in species richness and forb abundance between livestock types are not ecologically significant, and grazing intensity appears to be more important than species of grazer. Managers must balance changes in bryophyte abundance, forb diversity and plant species richness to achieve tradeoffs appropriate to their conservation objectives. The poor evidence base necessitates flexible, site-based management and rigorous monitoring where grazing of important mesotrophic pastures is undertaken. Further evidence regarding interactions between grazing intensity and livestock type is noticeably lacking, precluding prediction regarding livestock type impacts at given stocking intensities. Lack of detailed knowledge of land-use history is a major impediment and there is little information regarding taxa other than vascular plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

It is one of the fastest growing in recent years, mainly because of its efficiency in transforming feed into meat. However, the increase in aquaculture production raises some concerns, especially regarding the proper use of natural resources such as water, which is fundamental in aquaculture production systems. On the other hand, numerous systems, models, and production techniques have been developed and used to manage resources and reduce the negative impacts of the activity. However, it is not known which production systems and management practices are more sustainable, although the development and application of these technologies are crucial and profoundly influence this aspect of production. Emergy is a method that considers the contribution of nature and economy in the creation of the product and service, excluding the strictly monetary character present in conventional economic evaluations, being a model used to measure the level of sustainability in productive systems. In this sense, this study characterized the use of emergy analysis in aquaculture systems and discussed the main applications and potential uses, in addition to identifying the importance of water in the production and better destination of this resource for the economic and sustainable development of aquaculture. The systematic review methodology identified 17 articles using emergy analysis to assess environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The production systems evaluated vary between monocultures and polycultures at different production levels (intensive, semi-intensive, extensive). When all these particularities are transformed into the same unit (emjoule or solar joule), it is possible to compare different scenarios. As a primary resource of nature, water deserves more attention in the emergy accounting of aquaculture systems. It was shown the importance of a more detailed water analysis considering its effective use, impact (alteration or variation in its quality), and flow for a correct emergy analysis as a tool to promote the maintenance of the aquaculture activity over the years, which has in the water its most significant wealth.

AB  - Surface coal mining activities completely destroy vegetation cover, soil and biodiversity. The aftermaths include huge coal mine spoil dumps, changed topography, drainage and landscape, deteriorated aesthetics and increased pollution load. These coal mine spoils are characterised by high rock fragments, extremely low water holding capacity, compacted and high bulk density, lack of organic carbon and plant nutrients, low cation exchange capacity, acidic pH and toxic metal contamination, which poses difficulties in reclamation. An array of studies has been focused on the sustainable use of biochar for restoration of degraded agricultural soil by improving the soil physicochemical, nutritional and biological properties. Although a volume of studies has been done on biochar application, its specialised application in reclamation of coal mine spoils is still atypical, also a systematic review on the mechanism by which biochar amends the mine spoil is lacking. This review focuses on i) factors affecting the biochar properties, ii) the mechanism involved in altering the physical, chemical and biological properties by biochar, (iii) remediation of potentially toxic elements in soil and restoration of degraded land using biochar, and, iv) highlighting the important aspects to be considered while using biochar for reclamation of coal mine spoil. Biochar prepared at 450 degrees C from a lignocellulosic rich biomass can be an alternative for reclamation for coal mine spoil. Review also suggested suitable methodologies for bulk production, application and economics of biochar in coal mine spoil reclamation.

AB  - Background The clinical landscape of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has evolved in terms of disease definition and classification, trial designs, available therapies and treatment strategies as well as clinical guidelines. This study critically appraises published evidence synthesis studies, i.e. meta-analyses (MA) and network-meta-analyses (NMA), to better understand their quality, validity and discuss the impact of the findings from these studies on current decision-making in PAH. Methods A systematic literature review to identify MA/NMA studies considering approved and available therapies for treatment of PAH was conducted. Embase, Medline and the Cochrane's Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from database inception to April 22, 2020, supplemented by searches in health technology assessment websites. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) checklist covering six domains (relevance, credibility, analysis, reporting quality and transparency, interpretation and conflict of interest) was selected for appraisal of the included MA/NMA studies. Results Fifty-two full publications (36 MAs, 15 NMAs, and 1 MA/NMA) in PAH met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were of low quality, with none of the studies being scored as 'strong' across all checklist domains. Key limitations included the lack of a clearly defined, relevant decision problem, shortcomings in assessing and addressing between-study heterogeneity, and an incomplete or misleading interpretation of results. Conclusions This is the first critical appraisal of published MA/NMA studies in PAH, suggesting low quality and validity of published evidence synthesis studies in this therapeutic area. Besides the need for direct treatment comparisons assessed in long-term randomized controlled trials, future efforts in evidence synthesis in PAH should improve analysis quality and scrutiny in order to meaningfully address challenges arising from an evolving therapeutic landscape.

AB  - Many countries and governments consider smart cities a solution to global warming, population growth, and resource depletion. Numerous challenges arise while creating a smart city. Digital twins, along with the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless systems, blockchain, collaborative computing, simulation, and artificial intelligence technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of the current urban governance paradigm toward smart cities. In this paper, the concept of a digital twin city (DTC) is proposed. The characteristics, key technologies, and application scenarios of a DTC are elaborated upon. Further, we discuss the theories, research directions, and framework regarding DTCs. (c) 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

AB  - Several studies have analyzed whether sustainability standards-such as Fairtrade or Organic-deliver on their promise to benefit smallholder farmers in developing countries, with mixed results. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to consolidate results from 97 original studies. We place a focus on economic effects of sustainability standards and outcome variables that are frequently considered in quantitative studies, including output prices, yields, production costs, farmer profits, and household income. Results suggest that farmers certified under a sustainability standard receive 20-30% higher prices than their non-certified counterparts. Effects of standards on production costs and yields are mixed and vary across standards. Certified farmers gain higher profits, leading to an overall increase in household incomes through standards by 16-22%. Yet substantial heterogeneity exists, which is only partly attributable to observed factors that vary across studies (such as the type of product, standard, or region). Our findings suggest that more context-specific factors-such as the organization of supply chains-play a more decisive role. Based on a critical review of the sampling strategies and methods employed in the original studies, we discuss the generalizability of our findings and derive directions for policy and future research.

AB  - Purpose In recent years, the craft beer (CB) industry has gained impetus and has experienced significant growth in scientific publications. This study aims to present a systematic review of the literature on CB in areas related to economic and business sciences. Design/methodology/approach Based on the data from Scopus, Web of Science and a set of articles not indexed to these databases until June 2021, a total of 132 articles were included for analysis, using bibliometric and content analysis techniques. Findings The study allowed us to identify that CB has four main clusters/themes of research, namely, CB industry and market, marketing and branding, consumer behavior and sustainability. Detailed information on the clusters is provided. In addition, the results showed that publications addressing CB have grown significantly from 2015 onwards and are dispersed across many journals, with none assuming a clear leadership. Quantitative approaches account for more than half of publications. Research limitations/implications This study is a useful guide for academics intending to develop studies with CB. It provides a framework to structure future research by identifying existing literature clusters and proposes several research propositions. Practical implications The findings from this study are useful for CB companies to get an overview of the main issues affecting the CB industry and market to be able to adapt their strategies and stay aligned with market tendencies in the four main clusters identified. Originality/value This is the first systematic review of CB. Therefore, it provides a significant contribution to frame and strengthening the literature on CB and serves as a reference for future research. Based on the content analysis and cluster identification, the findings portray the status of current research. Accordingly, a set of research opportunities are offered.

AB  - Establishing protected areas constitutes one of the main strategies for the conservation of marine and coastal ecosystems. Increasing risks associated with environmental change along with highly degraded coastal ecosystems encompass complex management challenges for the long-term sustainability of these landscapes. This article aims to explore the role of protected areas in past and ongoing community adaptation to the compounded effects of climatic and anthropogenic change. A literature review of published articles is conducted through systematic queries of the bibliographic database Web of Sciences, and by comparing adaptation and social ecological resilience processes within and out of coastal protected areas. Findings underscore the absence of specific studies that target these topics inside protected areas, highlighting a geographic bias towards research largely carried out in developed countries. Results also indicate the current need for management practices within protected areas to adopt more participatory, comprehensive, and flexible approaches. Protected areas not only promote the conservation and provision of ecosystem services but are also key in building coastal communities' adaptive capacity and resilience in face of future scenarios.

AB  - The paper provides an overview of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is applied in different government sectors. Our methodology is based on a systematic review of 74 papers retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus databases. We find that the extant literature is less focused on healthcare, ICT, education, social and cultural services, and fashion sector; while ignoring the practical implementation of AI in these sectors. We present an organizing framework stating different areas related to governance and throws light on research gaps in the extant literature that can be further worked upon for promoting the research in digital governance.

AB  - Background:There has been a surge in interest with regard to the utility of liposomal bupivacaine as part of a perioperative pain management protocol. The current study was proposed to critically assess the efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine as a local anesthetic for pain relief following orthopaedic procedures.Methods:A systematic review of prospective, randomized trials involving liposomal bupivacaine was performed using searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The primary outcomes of interest included postoperative subjective pain scores and narcotic consumption. The length of stay and postoperative mobility were reviewed as secondary outcomes.Results:Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and were included for review. Twelve of 17 studies concluded that periarticular or local infiltrative liposomal bupivacaine offered no additive benefit compared with other local anesthetic injections. Peripheral nerve blocks without liposomal bupivacaine conferred more optimal pain relief and decreased narcotic consumption in the immediate postoperative period when compared with liposomal bupivacaine, with no differences thereafter. Twelve studies listed a conflict of interest related to the drug manufacturer (Pacira Pharmaceuticals). Eight of these studies (67%) demonstrated clinical superiority of liposomal bupivacaine when compared with the study control. In the 15 studies that did not show a conflict of interest, only 1 study (7%) demonstrated therapeutic superiority with use of periarticular liposomal bupivacaine when compared with a historical cohort that received no local or regional anesthesia.Conclusions:Current prospective, randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery fail to support the routine use of liposomal bupivacaine compared with other local injectable analgesics, particularly in the setting of knee replacement surgery. We were unable to find consistent support for the potential of superior pain relief and narcotic use reduction with the use of liposomal bupivacaine.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level I.

AB  - The high dependence of tourism activities on energy consumption, and particularly on non-renewable energy, is a major barrier to building sustainable tourism models. For this reason, the analysis of tourism and energy use is a growing field of study within sustainability debates. Despite this, there is a gap in the literature and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study that critically reviews the vast literature on the energy-tourism nexus. This paper aims to fill this gap in tourism knowledge. The main objective of this article is to conduct a systematic review of scientific studies with a quantitative empirical basis that examine this nexus, trying to answer the following questions: What are the main methodologies used to approach the tourism-energy nexus? which indicators or variables are relevant?; is there a consensus on the results?; and what are the main lines of discussion on the use of energy in tourism? To this end, we particularly focus on the main methodologies, results and perspectives during the period 2001-2021. A total of 1,189 articles were reviewed by abstract and title, 236 were included for the full review and 163 were finally selected. The results show how the nexus and energy dependence of tourism is assessed mainly from four major methodological groups: G1) econometric models, regressions and other statistical methodologies (67% of the sample); G2) surveys, questionnaires and energy audits (15%); G3) Life Cycle Analysis (13%) and G4) other approaches and environmental impact indicators to assess the relationship between energy and tourism (5%). The analysis between the causal relationships between tourism development, economic growth, energy use, environmental degradation and energy efficiency of accommodations are the main issues evaluated, considering a wide range of indicators/variables. Based on the gaps and limitations found in the literature review on tourism and energy, it is discussed how some findings should be interpreted with caution due to their methodological approaches and differences. Finally, some of the main lines of future research in this field are also presented.

AB  - Soil erosion is part of the erosion-sedimentation cycle and a type of land degradation that can be caused by poor land management. This is expected to be exacerbated by climate change. The rainfall erosivity factor (R) of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) family of soil erosion models is one of the most important parameters being studied because it is heavily influenced by climate change. The determination of the R factor necessitates high-frequency precipitation data, which are unavailable for a significant portion of the globe. For decades, re-searchers in data-sparse regions have estimated the R factor using empirical equations that required only monthly or annual rainfall data. Unfortunately, many of these equations are outdated and susceptible to misuse. This study presents an empirical R equation based on the Modified Fournier Index (MFI) that has caused probably one of the most widespread and unnoticed errors in soil erosion research for at least 33 years. Our exhaustive literature search and analysis uncovered 125 papers with 28 incorrect R equation formulations. We discovered that the earliest incorrect publication dates back to 1989, and most of the studies were conducted in Asia (China and India). The 125 published papers have similar citation characteristics (three citations per year per paper) as other papers in the field of soil erosion modelling, and many of the 125 papers were published in well-known scientific journals. Together, they have been cited over 3300 times by international researchers. In addition, the number of incorrect papers has increased dramatically over the past few years (2015-2021), indicating that the equation is spreading more frequently than the general publication trend. Since using an incorrect R equation can result in a significant bias in estimating the R factor and, consequently, soil erosion, the incorrect use could significantly bias numerous studies. The inaccuracy also hinders global efforts like the "Global Applications of Soil Erosion Modelling Tracker (GASEMT)" to synthesize soil erosion studies worldwide to shed light on the global problem of soil erosion and to promote environmental education. Consequently, the primary objective of this paper is to contribute to the recognition of the use of incorrect R equations, thereby reducing or even preventing their further spread and thus limiting the number of studies publishing biased results.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the major threats to global and local biodiversity. In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management. We expect that this review will provide direction for invasive plant species research and management aimed at protecting biodiversity in European temperate forest ecosystems.

AB  - Objectives: To identify barriers that are common and unique to six selected vulnerable groups: low socioeconomic status; Indigenous; mental illness and substance abuse; homeless; prisoners; and at-risk youth.
   Design: A systematic review was carried out to identify the perceived barriers to smoking cessation within six vulnerable groups.
   Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched using keywords and MeSH terms from each database's inception published prior to March 2014.
   Study selection: Studies that provided either qualitative or quantitative (ie, longitudinal, cross-sectional or cohort surveys) descriptions of self-reported perceived barriers to quitting smoking in one of the six aforementioned vulnerable groups were included.
   Data extraction: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.
   Results: 65 eligible papers were identified: 24 with low socioeconomic groups, 16 with Indigenous groups, 18 involving people with a mental illness, 3 with homeless groups, 2 involving prisoners and 1 involving at-risk youth. One study identified was carried out with participants who were homeless and addicted to alcohol and/or other drugs. Barriers common to all vulnerable groups included: smoking for stress management, lack of support from health and other service providers, and the high prevalence and acceptability of smoking in vulnerable communities. Unique barriers were identified for people with a mental illness (eg, maintenance of mental health), Indigenous groups (eg, cultural and historical norms), prisoners (eg, living conditions), people who are homeless (eg, competing priorities) and at-risk youth (eg, high accessibility of tobacco).
   Conclusions: Vulnerable groups experience common barriers to smoking cessation, in addition to barriers that are unique to specific vulnerable groups. Individual-level, community-level and social network-level interventions are priority areas for future smoking cessation interventions within vulnerable groups.

AB  - Cropland abandonment is an emerging human-induced land use and is a growing national problem in Nepal. It is a key, current concern for local governance bodies and restoration options for this land are being actively sought. We initiated a systematic review of existing studies to identify the key causes and impacts of cropland abandonment and consider a range of restoration options. Data on the drivers, impacts, and restoration options for abandoned cropland were extracted from current relevant literature retrieved through four databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and NepJol). Most studies focused on the drivers of cropland abandonment with less focus on the impacts and restoration options. Socio-economic drivers included outmigration, limited availability of labour or high labour cost, easy access to daily supply needs and high education level of the farming family members. Bio-physical factors were also reported as key drivers of cropland abandonment including unsuitable slope and rugged land topography, low soil fertility and low crop productivity. Both positive and negative impacts of cropland abandonment were also reported, principally bio-physical such as secondary vegetation succession as a positive impact and geomorphic damage and low crop production as negative impacts with a consequent decrease in food security. Most current studies focused principally on specific sites and typically lacked restoration options coordinated at a national level. Those studies that did identify restoration options for abandoned land suggested the adoption of short crop cycle, less labour-intensive crops, agro-forestry and conversion to pasture as key options. Most, however, failed to establish linkages between food insecurity, rural livelihoods, and ecosystem services after cropland is abandoned. As prior studies on abandoned land lack a defined study framework, we recommend an integrated research approach for Nepal. The approach suggests the need to adopt an integrated way for studying abandoned cropland restoration through the empirical analysis of local and national land abandonment issues. The proposed approach could also be applied in other areas where cropland abandonment is an issue.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted travel behaviours for very large numbers of people including those who shifted to teleworking and those without the option to work from home. While there is much valuable transport research that has examined the former category, it is still unknown how certain people such as health sector employees and delivery drivers changed their physical commuting in transport contexts that were radically different from those existing normally in urban areas. Based on a systematic review of 36 scientific publications on commuting during pandemic, this study pursues a dual objective. First, by examining the interrelated institutional, physical, and socio-psychological processes that supported or hindered low-carbon transport the study revealed that (A) public transport (PT) reduced service levels and concerns related to COVID were positively associated with substantial shifts away from PT towards car and active travel; (B) this positive association was found to be even stronger in the existence of pre-pandemic habit of car use for commute and strong negative emotions like fear triggered by environmental changes and health risks. Second, by synthesising the key findings from the literature, this study provides significant implications for how mode choice is modelled through the Theory of Planned Behavior and Norm Activation Model. By questioning whether the pandemic commuters had a "normal" set of travel mode alternatives to choose from, the study draws attention to the nuances of mode "choice" versus mode "use" and moves beyond the assumption that commuting always results from individuals making choices. It also argues that the role of (negative) emotions along with the importance of proximity to, or separation from, other bodies on how people commute should be considered in future research. Finally, the crucial role of COVID-19 in changing travel-related norms and the resulting long-term implications for policy interventions require further investigation by future research.

AB  - To our knowledge, there is no available standardized educational curriculum designed to promote the incorporation of skin cancer examinations and procedures into general practice. To explore the contemporary training landscape, we conducted a systematic review of educational interventions designed to support skin cancer diagnostic examinations by primary care providers (PCPs). Our review uniquely encompasses all PCPs, including practicing physicians, residents, and advanced practice practitioners (APPs). The objective of this study is to review and synthesize worldwide data on educational interventions addressing PCP performance of skin cancer diagnostic examinations. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Scopus for English language articles worldwide published from 2000 onwards. Articles were screened for eligibility, and possibly overlapping datasets were resolved. Data extracted included curriculum content, delivery format, and educational outcomes. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 63 studies were selected for data inclusion with one addressing training for resident physicians, 4 for APPs, and the remainder for practicing physicians. Educational interventions included in this review reflect the pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic educational environment: half provided live/synchronous instruction of about 5-h duration on average, and a quarter featured interactive components. Less than a quarter of interventions included practice change as a specific reported outcome. Without sustainable practice change, the anticipated long-term benefits of early cancer detection in patients remain limited. Previous and existing educational interventions designed to support skin cancer detection by PCPs demonstrate heterogeneous curriculum content, delivery methods, and educational outcomes. An ideal intervention would teach consensus-derived clinical competencies, provide meaningful learner feedback, and measure outcomes, such as knowledge/competency, confidence/attitudes, and practice change, using validated instruments.

AB  - Within the tourism industry, the hotel sector's vulnerabilities are multi-faceted. This literature discussion scrutinizes how disaster and resilience is framed for the tourism sector, and, more specifically, how the concepts can be applied to the hotel sector. A synthesis of the literature points to the importance of prioritizing disaster resilience building for the hotel sector. The body of literature regarding disasters, tourism, and more specifically hotels, has increased over the last 20 years, still improvements in the hotel sector's disaster preparedness and do not appear to be on the same trajectory. Illustrating the predicament of the contemporary hotel industry serves to open a discussion about the value of building resiliency to disaster for hotels. As the numbers of people affected by disasters grows, the importance of providing actionable information to limit the severity of these events on communities also escalates in pace.

AB  - Cephalopods are a diverse group of species, with a high ecological and economic relevance. Despite this, its species diversity has been studied in few places at regional scale. We herein aim to update the current state of knowledge and diversity of cephalopods fauna of the Canary Islands. We carried out a systematic review of the available literature regarding cephalopod species in the area spanned from 1834 to 2019. More specifically, we reviewed (a) records of historic and recent research cruises; (b) records of species from scientific literature and technical reports; and (c) stomach contents analysis of top predators. A total of 48 documents, including scientific literature, technical reports, and species referenced in museums collections of cephalopods caught around the Canary Islands were identified. The current species richness in different habitats from coastal to deep-sea zones was determined according to records and previous information on the ecology of each species. These records revealed that this small archipelago holds 85 confirmed species belonging to 31 families, representing ca. 10% of the overall known cephalopod diversity. The cephalopod community was dominated by oceanic cephalopods, followed by shelf-slope and coastal cephalopods species with 65, 11, and 9 species, respectively. 47% of the species showed a wide geographic distribution (33 cosmopolitan and 7 presents in more than one ocean), whereas 19 are only encountered in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and 26 are exclusively Atlantic. This species richness is comparable to other cephalopod biodiversity hotspots, such as the Indian Ocean Ridge or the Caribbean. The Canarian cephalopod diversity likely to be underestimated, since scarce information exists on species inhabiting the deeper water layers around the Canary Islands. This work represents the first baseline of cephalopod biodiversity around the Canary Islands; hence, it constitutes a first step to develop future research on this taxonomic group.

AB  - Because of the significant impacts on both human interests and bird conservation, it is imperative to identify patterns and anticipate drivers of human-bird conflicts (HBCs) worldwide. Through a global systematic review, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we analyzed the socioeconomic factors and bird ecological traits driving the degree of knowledge and extent of HBCs. We included 166 articles published from 1971 to 2020 in our analyses through which we built a profile of the socioeconomic conditions of 52 countries with reported conflicts and the ecological traits of the 161 bird species involved in HBCs. Although HBC expanded worldwide, it had the greatest impact in less-developed countries (estimate 0. 66 [SE 0.13], p< 0.05), where agriculture is critical for rural livelihoods. Species with a relatively greater conflict extent had a relatively broader diet (estimate 0.80 [SE 0.22], p<0.05) and an increasing population trend (estimate 0.58 [SE 0.15], p<0.05) and affected human interests, such as agriculture and livestock raising. In countries with greater biodiversity, HBCs caused greater socioeconomic impacts than in more developed countries. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and addressing HBCs from multiple perspectives (ecological, sociocultural, and political) to effectively protect both biodiversity and local livelihoods.

AB  - Background and objectives Video-based telemedicine provides an alternative health care delivery model for patients with CKD. The objective was to provide an overview of the available evidence on the implementation and outcomes of adopting video-based telemedicine in nephrology.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL were searched in December 2019 and again in January 2021 for studies using video-based telemedicine for adults across the spectrum of kidney disease. Study types included peer-reviewed clinical trials, observational studies, and descriptive studies available in full text. Search results were independently screened by two authors, who then independently reviewed and extracted data from the eligible studies. Results were synthesized in tabular format, summarizing study characteristics by area within nephrology; the video-based interventions used; and clinical, health care utilization, and patient-reported outcomes.
   Results After reviewing 1870 unique citations, 24 studies were included (four randomized controlled trials, six cohort studies, five pre-post intervention studies, seven case series, and two qualitative studies). Video-based technology was used to facilitate care across all stages of CKD. Although earlier studies used a range of institution-specific technologies that linked main hospital sites to more remote health care locations, more recent studies used technology platforms that allowed patients to receive care in a location of their choice. Video-based care was well received, with the studies reporting high patient satisfaction and acceptable clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions Video-based telemedicine is being used for kidney care and has evolved to be less reliant on specialized telemedicine equipment. As its use continues to grow, further primary studies and systematic reviews of outcomes associated with the latest innovations to video-based care in nephrology can address knowledge gaps, such as approaches to sustainable integration and minimization of barriers to access.

AB  - The paramos biome of the northern Andes is a collection of high-mountain tropical grassland wetland ecosystems that provides important ecosystem services including hydrological buffering and water supply. Human activities in these ecosystems transform vegetation cover and soil hydro-physical properties, affecting their hydrological performance and water quality and quantity. Here, we conducted a systematic review on the influence of land use (agriculture, livestock grazing, and afforestation) on the hydro-physical properties of paramo soils and analyzed its implications for streamflow buffering. Our review protocol identified 32 relevant papers, from which key hydro-physical properties linked to streamflow variability were available: soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), porosity, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention capacity (WRC). The analysis shows that soils with native cover are characterized by a porous structure that allows a high WRC and SOM content. Agriculture increases macroporosity but it leads to bare fallow plots that promote loss of nutrients and SOM. Burning generates hydrophobic aggregates that affect WRC. Livestock grazing produces soil compaction and increases bulk density, reducing infiltration and WRC. Lastly, afforestation with exotic species (e.g. pines, eucalyptus) decreases SOM and WRC by changing soil structure. In general, the analyzed land-use activities generate hydrophobic aggregates, increase bulk density, promote erosion and runoff, and impair hydrological buffering capacity. This integrated evidence from multiple empirical studies can be used to effectively communicate the effects of different land use practices on paramo soils, provide information for modelling in data-scarce situations, and contribute to decision making processes for land use planning and conservation.

AB  - The agricultural sector in the European Union is largely characterized by a declining number of farms and an increasing size of surviving farms. The land is concentrating under the usage of fewer large agricultural producers. Meanwhile, a broad distribution of land ownership is the basis for the welfare of local economies and rural communities. Land distribution is one important component that guarantees our right to food, human rights, and sustainability in agriculture. The aim of this paper was to compile a systematic review of the existing literature on large-scale land acquisitions in Europe. The results are based on two different search methods. Firstly, documents and articles on large-scale land acquisitions were studied and, secondly, keyword research from the SCOPUS database and analysis using VOSviewer where performed. This study shows that large-scale land acquisitions are closely related to food security, human rights, global governance and international law, land tenure, biofuel production, and financialization through European Union common agricultural policy subsidies and foreign direct investments.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the state of academic research on innovation in tourism. The authors present a systematic review of the literature, different research approaches and perspectives on tourism innovation; offer a synthesis of our findings and provide a discussion and proposals for future research.
   Design/methodology/approach - Existing studies on innovation in hospitality and tourism (included in the Web of Knowledge database) were reviewed, and their limitations were identified. A procedure used in previous studies (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Tranfield et al., 2003; Becheikh et al., 2006) was applied. Moreover, aiming to reveal theoretical foundations of tourism innovation research and identify their structure, a bibliometric analysis was performed.
   Findings - This paper identifies 152 published papers that represent the major efforts in expanding the body of research on innovation in hospitality and tourism. The importance of innovation for business and regional competitiveness and success has been recognised by both researchers and practitioners. In the papers included in the sample of this paper, the authors identified a general consensus that much remains to be done in the development of the theory of innovation in tourism. Through bibliometric analysis, nine co-citation networks, or clusters, were retrieved by applying co-citation relations among the most cited authors. The examination of these nine clusters revealed some dominant themes that characterise the field.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors used three databases: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index. While these databases may not include all relevant research, the authors, nonetheless, believe that by using a rigorous procedure in reviewing the literature systematically, they were able to reduce the probability of neglecting any information that would critically change the content of the present paper.
   Practical implications - The aim of this paper was to bring together the prior research with presently existing models that may be used in further research. For the continuation of the research, the authors propose additional studies with the aim of theory development. By introducing new theoretical ideas and theoretical models, more qualitative and inductive research would help to stimulate further work. As stated above, researchers could go further by undertaking quantitative methods to empirically verify the theoretically proposed models.
   Originality/value - Since the last review (Hjalager, 2010) of past studies in tourism innovation, mostly focusing on studies up to 2009, tourism innovation research has grown noticeably in terms of diverse topics. In this paper's database, the year with the most publications was 2012 with 48 papers, followed by 2014 with 42 (by 19 September), 2010 and 2011 with 41 and 2009 with 29. To the authors' knowledge, no updated reviews focusing on innovation in tourism have been published recently. This study, consisting of a systematic review of academic literature, includes analyses of the international context, the methodology used, the points of view, the level of analysis (micro-level, macro-level and general level) and the type of innovation discussed in the paper. Moreover, the authors did not find any studies that used bibliometric analysis to identify the structure of the theoretical foundation of research in the area of innovation in tourism.

AB  - Although increasing concern about climate change has raised awareness of the fundamental role of forest ecosystems, forests are threatened by human-induced impacts worldwide. Among them, wildfire risk is clearly the result of the interaction between human activities, ecological domains, and climate. However, a clear understanding of these interactions is still needed both at the global and local levels. Numerous studies have proven the validity of the socioecological system (SES) approach in addressing this kind of interdisciplinary issue. Therefore, a systematic review of the existing literature on the application of SES frameworks to forest ecosystems is carried out, with a specific focus on wildfire risk management. The results demonstrate the existence of different methodological approaches that can be grouped into seven main categories, which range from qualitative analysis to quantitative spatially explicit investigations. The strengths and limitations of the approaches are discussed, with a specific reference to the geographical setting of the works. The research suggests the importance of local community involvement and local knowledge consideration in wildfire risk management. This review provides a starting point for future research on forest SES and a supporting tool for the development of a sustainable wildfire risk adaptation and mitigation strategy.

AB  - BackgroundForest landscape restoration (FLR), often through tree planting, is one of the priorities in many global and national initiatives for carbon offsetting as part of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. However, active efforts to meet FLR objectives entail substantial costs for the procurement of planting stocks and require an experienced workforce for planting and nurturing tree seedlings. Alternatively, restoration projects can be more cost-effective and potentially may have greater biodiversity gain through assisting and accelerating natural forest regeneration. The use of perches is one of the strategies under Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and is used to attract avian seed dispersers to degraded habitats for increased tree seed supply and seedling establishment. This systematic review and potential meta-analysis aim to determine the effectiveness of artificial and natural perches in promoting natural forest regeneration. Specifically, we will evaluate their effectiveness in driving seed richness, seed density, seedling richness, and seedling density. The results will synthesize available evidence on the topic, identify knowledge gaps we need filling to upscale the strategy, and inform their use in concert with other ANR strategies.MethodsThe search strategy was informed through a literature scan and discussions with stakeholders and experts. A total of eight databases, which include an organizational library and a web-based search engine, will be searched using the refined search string in English. The search string was formed using keywords corresponding to the PICO structure of the research question, and its comprehensiveness was evaluated using 10 benchmark articles. The search results will be screened by the review team (composed of a primary and at least two secondary reviewers) using the set eligibility criteria at the title and abstract level, followed by the full-text screening. The screened studies will then undergo critical appraisal using the assessment criteria based on risk of bias and methods. Data from the accepted studies will be extracted to the standard data sheet for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedges' g) will be computed to determine whether perches are effective in increasing seed dispersal and seedling establishment in degraded sites. The effect of potential modifiers relating to the landscape will be explored via mixed models.

AB  - Objective Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a worsened metabolic profile but the progression of cardiometabolic features over time is unclear. Understanding this natural history is a key priority in PCOS research and vital for guiding the prevention and management of this common condition. We explored cardiometabolic changes that are observed in women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS across the life course. Design, Patients and Measurements A systematic review of longitudinal cohort studies was conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid PsycInfo, CINAHL PLUS and EBM reviews between 15 January 2020 and 11 February 2021. Eligible studies included participants with or without PCOS diagnosed according to the 2003 Rotterdam or the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria. We included studies that were published from the year 1990 to 2021 with data on cardiometabolic outcomes as per the PCOS core outcomes set. Results There were 31 longitudinal studies with 28,316 participants from four continents. At the start of follow up, participants were aged between 1 year and 49 years with a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 32 years. Changes in BMI and the risk of coronary heart disease were similar in adult women with and without PCOS. Women with PCOS had a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes than their non-PCOS counterparts. Evidence for the majority of all other outcomes was conflicting and with inadequate data. Conclusion Understanding the natural history of PCOS and particularly changes in cardiometabolic features remains challenging. Existing literature is extensive but heterogeneous and inconsistent. Longitudinal studies in unselected populations are needed to provide high-quality data in this area.

AB  - The objective of this work was to conduct a review on the use of artificial intelligence (Al) techniques applied to the formulation of public policies that contribute to the agricultural vocation of the regions. To this effect, a descriptive methodology with a mixed approach was employed. The methodological design used was PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The analyzed publications were taken from the Scopus database. For the quantitative analysis, the VosViewer software and the Bibliometrix R language library were used. As a result, it was found that Al techniques are employed to identify areas with an agricultural vocation or to find better agricultural practices that promote sustainable development. It was concluded that this research area is incipient and that it is necessary to generate new models that are more robust and include demographic, social, environmental, economic, and political variables.

AB  - Over 85% of the world's oyster reefs have been lost in the past two centuries, triggering a global effort to restore shellfish reef ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. While there has been considerable success in re-establishing oyster reefs, many challenges remain. These include: high incidence of failed restoration, high cost of restoration per unit area, and increasing stress from climate change. In order to leverage our past successes and progress the field, we must increase restoration efficiencies that not only reduce cost per unit area, but also increase the resilience of restored ecosystems. To help address this need, we qualitatively review the literature associated with the structure and function of oyster reef ecosystems to identify key positive species interactions (i.e., those species interactions where at least one partner benefits and no partners are harmed). We classified positive interand intraspecific interactions between oysters and organisms associated with oyster ecosystems into the following seven functional categories: (1) physical reef creation, (2) positive density dependence, (3) refugia from physical stress, (4) refugia from biological stress, (5) biodiversity enhancement, (6) settlement improvement, and (7) long-distance facilitation. We discuss each category of positive interaction and how restoration practitioners can use knowledge of such processes to enhance restoration success. We propose that systematic incorporation of positive species interactions into restoration practice will both enhance ecological services provided by restored reefs and increase restoration success.

AB  - This study provides the first systematic review of the different marketing strategies used for promoting SMEs in Pacific Island countries (PICs). Literature published in high-ranked management journals was reviewed in this area using PRISMA guidelines published between 2000 and 2020. The study identifies three major marketing communication strategies useful for SMEs in the PICs: digital marketing strategies, market orientation strategies, and experience-based marketing strategies. Further, this study includes a detailed future research agenda under these three major themes. The digital marketing strategies are divided further into social media marketing strategies, blogs, and company websites. Market orientation strategies were categorised as the role of infrastructure development and the role of innovation. The experience-based marketing is another marketing strategy to attract customers. For example, it is identified through the literature that PICs can focus more on cultural festivals and cruise ship markets.

AB  - Research on the plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPM) is increasing strongly due to the biotechnological potential for the agricultural, forestry, and food industry. The benefits of using PGPM in crop production are well proven; however, their incorporation in agricultural management is still limited. Therefore, we wanted to explore the gaps and challenges for the transfer of biotechnological innovations based on PGPM to the agricultural sector. Our systematic review of the state of the art of PGPM research and knowledge transfer takes Chile as an example. Several transfer limiting aspects are identified and discussed. Our two main conclusions are: neither academia nor industry can meet unfounded expectations during technology transfer, but mutually clarifying their needs, capabilities, and limitations is the starting point for successful collaborations; the generation of a collaborative innovation environment, where academia as well as public and private stakeholders (including the local community) take part, is crucial to enhance the acceptance and integration of PGPM on the way to sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Since they are more environmentally acceptable than their chemically synthesized counterparts, biosurfactants are used in a wide range of environmental applications. However, less research has been done on biosurfactants within the context of the circular economy, despite their theoretical potential to fulfill a number of circular economy ambitions, including closing the consumption loop, regenerating natural systems, and maintaining resource value within the system. Hence, the main objective of this review is to identify and analyze the contributions of biosurfactants to the implementation of the circular economy. A final sample of 30 papers from the Web of Science database was examined. We identified five broad categories of contributions: waste stream-derived production, combating food waste, strengthening soil health, and improving the efficiency of water resources. We concluded that, while manufacturing biosurfactants from waste streams can reduce production costs, optimizing yield remains a contentious issue that complicates the adoption of biosurfactants into the circular economy framework.

AB  - The integrated rice-duck farming (IRDF), in which ducks feed on insects and weeds in paddies and fertilise rice plants, has been a flagship of Asian sustainable-agriculture movements. Nevertheless, IRDF is not spreading rapidly enough to the extent to which it becomes a successful alternative agriculture. This paper undertakes a systematic review of a collection of experimental IRDF studies in order to derive an insight from the divergent experimental settings and findings. The paper also identifies the strengths and weaknesses of, opportunities for and threats to IRDF from the perspective of IRDF farmers, using the expert elicitation method. Five IRDF expert farmers from each of South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam were interviewed for this purpose. The experimental studies and the expert farmers concurred that the most recognisable empirical strength of IRDF is the synergy of rice and ducks. It was found that the establishment of organic food certification systems provides an opportunity for IRDF to grow. On the other hand, labour-intensiveness was found the most challengeable weakness of IRDF. In parallel, labour shortage in rural areas was found as a serious threat to IRDF. It appears that the weaknesses and threats are more influential than the strengths and opportunities to shaping the adoption of IRDF. In order to make IRDF economically more feasible, the non-market ecological benefits of IRDF in mitigating land degradation and global warming can and should be internalised through appropriate policy instruments.

AB  - An up-to-date systematic review and unofficial codification of the national fisheries legislation was conducted, along with an up-to-date systematic review of environmental, archaeological and maritime legislation, about spatio-temporal restrictions of fishing activities, by all fishing gears, in the Aegean Sea. Spatio-temporal restrictions established by the European Union and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean were also reviewed. A database was built, including detailed information on the identified Fisheries Restricted Areas (FRAs). All FRAs were mapped, as polygons in Geographic Information System shapefiles. The national fisheries, environmental, archaeological and maritime legal framework comprises 32, 2, 37 and 43 legal acts respectively; EU and GFCM legislation consists of one Regulation and one Recommendation, respectively. A total of 521 FRAs were identified in the study area, out of which 511 are national (254 established by fisheries, 21 by environmental, 85 by archaeological and 151 by maritime legislation), 6 are EU and 4 are international FRAs. 85.2% are located in the Aegean Sea and 14.8% in Crete. Towed or mobile gears are restricted in 88.5% of the FRAs, while static gears are restricted in only 10.2% of the FRAs. Fish stocks and Posidonia oceanica beds protection are the most common reasons for regulating fishing activities (25.3% and 25.0% respectively). Most of the FRAs (85.4%) impose permanent closures. National fisheries, environmental, archaeological, maritime, EU and international FRAs cover 25.8%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 0.4%, 13.5% and 22.6% of the study area, respectively. This study provides valuable information for Maritime Spatial Planning in the Aegean Sea.

AB  - This paper reviews previous research on the sustainability and policies of palm oil-based bioenergy in Indonesia and Malaysia. A systematic literature review with a meta-analysis (PRISMA) methodology was performed to evaluate the related articles discussing sustainability and bioenergy policies. This study found 96 articles that mapped the sustainability and policies of bioenergy in Indonesia and Malaysia over the last decade. The sus-tainability studies were divided into two areas: the environment and socioeconomics. Researchers were more likely to examine environmental factors than socioeconomic factors, specifically focusing on the following environmental indicators: land use conversion, deforestation, and CO2 emissions. Most policy studies concen-trated on sustainability and energy security. Over the last two decades, the development of bioenergy policies in Indonesia and Malaysia has been comparable in terms of geographical position and palm oil production. However, Indonesia's bioenergy policy has tended to be more vigorous and dynamic than Malaysia.

First, the common research themes repeatedly appearing in the SG and SUES literature are categorized into logical physical, cyber, and social energy processes. Critical findings are summarized for each part, i.e., the advances and trends in physical energy generation, transmission, consumption, and storage processes of cities for energy interventions, the cyber process chain of energy sensing, modeling, forecasting, scheduling, coordinating, and adapting for enhancing the "smartness" of power and urban energy systems, and the social energy processes of understanding, protecting, engaging, and governing human to be a new smartness dimension. Second, the process-based framework provides insights on the design and implementation of SG and SUES for engineers, planners, and policymakers, such as optimizing the system performance by upgrading individual processes and exploring new links among identified physical, cyber, and social energy processes. The upscaling barriers and strategies of sustainable energy technologies in the development and deployment stages are also summarized to scale up sustainable energy processes to a higher level. Finally, future research directions are envisioned, including developing data markets, privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics for urban-scale energy modeling, refining policy and standards for safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and interoperability issues, assessing technology maturity and energy system success factors, and removing regulatory and structural barriers.

AB  - Successful decision-making for environmental management requires evidence of the performance and efficacy of proposed conservation interventions. Projecting the future impacts of prospective conservation policies and programs is challenging due to a range of complex ecological, economic, social and ethical factors, and in particular the need to extrapolate models to novel contexts. Yet many extrapolation techniques currently employed are limited by unfounded assumptions of causality and a reliance on potentially biased inferences drawn from limited data. We show how these restrictions can be overcome by established and emerging techniques from causal inference, scenario analysis, systematic review, expert elicitation, and global sensitivity analysis. These technical advances provide avenues to untangle cause from correlation, evaluate and transfer models between contexts, characterize uncertainty, and address imperfect data. With more rigorous projections of prospective performance of interventions, scientists can deliver policy and program advice that is more scientifically credible.

AB  - The crude oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria is under threat due to anthropogenic activities that include mainly PAH contamination. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), multiple online searches were conducted using several databases (e.g. Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, National Library of Medicine, PubMed etc.) between October and November 2022 to collect evidence on pervasiveness, bioaccumulation and health challenges posed by PAH in Nigeria Niger Delta. Included studies were appraised for quality using the Standard for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0) framework and the Joanna Briggs (JB) checklist and retrieved data were analysed using the narrative synthesis method.With the indiscriminate exposure of the local inhabitants to PAH and a lack of public health policies that efficiently prevent exposure-associated adverse health events, there is a need for a collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach, cutting across boundaries of animal, human, and environmental health to undertake risk assessments, develop plans for response and control in an attempt to protect public health. The complex and wide distribution of PAHs within the Niger Delta region would benefit of the One Health strategy. Such systemic approach would help managing the harmful effects of PAHs on ecosystems, from environmental remedial ap-proaches to measures to mitigate exposure-associated risks. One health, including environmental health and food safety, would help risk assessors and risk managers in prioritising actions for the prevention and mitigation of PAHs pollution and its spread and accumulation.

AB  - Tunisia's Ichkeul Lake is among the most productive ecosystems in the Mediterranean, with a great regional value thanks to its diversity of habitats. It is an important overwintering area for waterfowl species. It is a RAMSAR wetland, a National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage, and a Biosphere Reserve. This review paper provides a broad overview of the climatic, hydraulic, biogeochemical features, bio-resources, and bio-productivity of the Lake. The interconnectivity between the different environmental components of the lake is presented, highlighting the main characteristics of this vital ecosystem. Its ecosystem consists of a permanent lake bordered by temporary marshes. It is connected to the Mediterranean Sea via Bizerte Lagoon under a typical semi-arid to sub-humid bio-climate with wet and dry seasons. The winter rainfall fills up the rivers and lake with freshwater that overflows into the Tinja River. In summer, high evaporation reduces the water level and allows seawater to enter the wetland from Bizerte Lagoon. The ecosystem is threatened by pollution, the damming of its main rivers, and climate change. The unsustainable water management has resulted in fundamental environ-mental modifications, as evidenced by the large variation in the salinity, water level, productivity of water plants, and the decline in venue and stop-overs of waterbirds. The current situation is a warning that indicates a general perturbation of the resources of this particular site and of Tunisian wetlands in general, especially that the Mediterranean region has been designated as a climate change hotspot. Accurate hydrological management is needed to boost the physical functioning of the ecosystem, and to gain deeper knowledge of the different phases of the water cycle and its relationship to other long-term environmental cycles for sustainable water management strategies in the most water-scarce region in the world.

AB  - Background: Access to mobile phone technology has rapidly expanded in developing countries. In Africa, mHealth is a relatively new concept and questions arise regarding reliability of the technology used for health outcomes. This review documents strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of mHealth projects in Africa.
   Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on mHealth projects in Africa, between 2003 and 2013, was carried out using PubMed and OvidSP. Data was synthesized using a SWOT analysis methodology.
   Results were grouped to assess specific aspects of project implementation in terms of sustainability and mid/long-term results, integration to the health system, management process, scale-up and replication, and legal issues, regulations and standards. Results: Forty-four studies on mHealth projects in Africa were included and classified as: "patient follow-up and medication adherence" (n = 19), "staff training, support and motivation" (n = 2), "staff evaluation, monitoring and guidelines compliance" (n = 4), "drug supply-chain and stock management" (n = 2), "patient education and awareness" (n = 1), "disease surveillance and intervention monitoring" (n = 4), "data collection/transfer and reporting" (n = 10) and "overview of mHealth projects" (n = 2). In general, mHealth projects demonstrate positive health-related outcomes and their success is based on the accessibility, acceptance and low-cost of the technology, effective adaptation to local contexts, strong stakeholder collaboration, and government involvement. Threats such as dependency on funding, unclear healthcare system responsibilities, unreliable infrastructure and lack of evidence on cost-effectiveness challenge their implementation. mHealth projects can potentially be scaled-up to help tackle problems faced by healthcare systems like poor management of drug stocks, weak surveillance and reporting systems or lack of resources.
   Conclusions: mHealth in Africa is an innovative approach to delivering health services. In this fast-growing technological field, research opportunities include assessing implications of scaling-up mHealth projects, evaluating cost-effectiveness and impacts on the overall health system.

AB  - Land use optimization is a promising approach to achieve urban sustainability. Despite the increasing number of literature on land use optimization, a little investigation is made to systematically review urban land use optimization: its objectives, methodological approaches, and spatial data used etc. This creates room to review the methodological approaches to urban land use optimization. This study systematically reviews 55 articles following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol to understand important aspects of urban land use optimization. We have found that the most common objectives which were used in urban land use optimization are maximization of spatial compactness (16.67 %, n=28) and maximization of land use compatibility (13.69%, n=23), followed by maximization of land use suitability (11.90%, n=20). The findings suggest that a) one and only one land use in each cell, b) minimum and maximum area of certain land use, and c) restriction on specific land use change are the important constraints. This study also identifies that urban sustainability has been merely touched upon in urban land use optimizations. While environmental (including ecology) and economic aspects of urban sustainability were included in 46.67% and 43.33% studies respectively, the social aspect (10%, n= 3) was mostly ignored. Our findings also indicate that there is no generalized method to measure economic, environmental, and social benefits from land use planning. This study also finds that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) (32.14%, n=18) accounts for a major contribution to solve the urban land use optimization problem. Based on the findings, this study proposes some recommendations for further research and practice. The most important of them include a) framing land use optimization objective functions considering urban sustainability, b) developing a standard method to calculate values of objective functions, and c) integrating a participatory approach with mathematical optimization to derive more feasible solutions. These recommendations could be the scope of future research.

AB  - Mediterranean woody species are vulnerable to multiple stresses that negatively affect plant survival and productivity. Drought and heat are increasing threats to the agricultural and forestry systems, making it urgently necessary to determine the mechanisms of plant adaptation and survival. Proteomics allows for the characterisation of a large number of proteins in a given tissue/organ, providing an integrated picture of the molecular events involved in stress responses. In this paper, we have evaluated the contribution of proteomics for the identification of stress-responsive proteins and tolerance/adaptation mechanisms in woody plants of agronomic importance in the Mediterranean basin. A systematic review was performed (Web of Knowledge, 5th March 2013) on the relevant genera for this region: Quercus sp., Pinus sp., Eucalyptus sp., Vitis sp., Olive sp., and Citrus sp. The term Rosaceae was also included in the search due to the relevance of fruit tree crops of this family in the Mediterranean region. This systematic review highlighted the lack of extensive and comprehensive proteomic analyses for Mediterranean plants under stress. The approach retrieved 19 and 38 papers concerning the assessment of abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively, at the proteome level, and 20 and 46 papers, respectively, concerning analyses at the transcriptomics level. With regard to abiotic stress, gel-based proteomic methodologies (15 papers) enabled the identification and quantification of 395 stress-responsive proteins. These results revealed metabolic adjustments to stress, with major alterations in carbon, nitrogen, and amino acid metabolisms. The most consistently represented stress-responsive proteins were RuBisCO, RuBisCO activase, heat shock proteins, chlorophyll alb binding protein, and proteins from the oxygen-evolving complex. We concluded that gel-based proteomics revealed key proteins and metabolic pathways important for the ability of plants to adjustment to environmental fluctuations. The integration of this information with physiological, agronomic, and technological performance (e.g. survival, productivity, and food and technological quality) is essential for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean regions.

AB  - The plastic bags, throughout the life cycle, constitute a relevant problem within the sustainability for its generated impacts, be it in the environmental, social or economic aspect. This work aimed to identify the main scientific studies that address the issues of plastic bags from the perspective of sustainability between the years 2000 and 2018. For this, a systematic review of the literature was carried out, using a quantitative and qualitative approach, which made it possible to survey the state of the art on plastic bags in the perspective of sustainability from 2000 to the current year. The searches were conducted in July 2018, in three databases that bring together the main national and international journals. It was observed that 73.68% of the studies analyzed are concentrated in 2013 and that 84.21% are published in international journals, 42.11% of which are in journals with A1 to B2 in the area of public and business administration, accounting sciences and tourism. It was possible to divide them into three categories: generated impacts, disseminated environmental practices and consumer behavior / perception. In this last category, although it was the one that presented the most studies, it was observed that all were carried out considering the environmental and social sustainability pillars, giving great importance to the consumption problem, however, the economic pillar was not mentioned. Thus, there is a research gap regarding the analysis of the feasibility for companies to create or maintain plastic bags with environmental characteristics or not, according to the consumer's behavior/perception.

AB  - Predicting which non-native species will negatively impact biodiversity is a longstanding research priority. The Functional Response (FR; resource use in relation to availability) is a classical ecological concept that has been increasingly applied to quantify, assess and compare ecological impacts of non-native species. Despite this recent growth, an overview of applications and knowledge gaps across relevant contexts is currently lacking. We conducted a systematic review using a combination of terms regarding FR and invasion science to synthesise scientific studies that apply the FR approach in the field and to suggest new areas where it could have valuable applications. Trends of publications using FR in invasion science and publications about FR in general were compared through the Activity Index. Data were extracted from papers to reveal temporal, bibliographic, and geographic trends, patterns in study attributes such as type of interaction and habitat investigated, taxonomic groups used, and context-dependencies assessed. In total, 120 papers were included in the review. We identified substantial unevenness in the reporting of FRs in invasion science, despite a rapidly growing number of studies. To date, research has been geographically skewed towards North America and Europe, as well as towards predator-prey interactions in freshwater habitats. Most studies have focused on a few species of invertebrates and fishes. Species origin, life stage, environmental temperature and habitat complexity were the most frequently considered context -depend-encies. We conclude that while the FR approach has thus far been narrowly applied, it has broad potential application in invasion science and can be used to test major hypotheses in this research field.

AB  - The Brazilian Semiarid historically suffers from droughts and environmental degradation. It is dominated by Caatinga, the world's most diverse seasonally dry forest and home to 59% of Brazilians in extreme poverty, most in rural areas under water scarcity. Land use and climate changes are expected to exacerbate socio-economic vulnerability, making it a top climate change adaptation priority. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is a mix of policies, more cost-effective when promoting adaptation. Through a systematic review, we investigated the political context percolating EbA and climate change adaptation in the Caatinga. Unlike the political history, land use policies in Caatinga should support sustainable agriculture and ecosystem conservation to promote adaptation. We discuss obstacles and opportunities for implementing EbA in the region and present a novel EbA policy-mix framework integrated with the Coexistence with the Semi-aridity paradigm. This includes contextualized education, capacity development, social technologies, well planned and climate resilient protected areas, and land title grants.

AB  - As an outcome of interactions and interdependencies with people, agroecosystems provide cultural ecosystem services (CES), such as traditional knowledge, recreation, and places for social gatherings. Today however, agroecosystems undergo biophysical changes because of land-use and management changes (LUMC), such as intensive agriculture, urbanisation, and land abandonment. Typically, environmental conflicts emerge between stakeholders with differing interests in land areas around the LUMC. Cumulatively, these changes and conflicts have substantial influence on the CES appreciation of the farmland, triggering different types of responses, including social mobilisation and resistance.
   A comprehensive analysis of these processes was missing in the literature. Here we present a systematic review of CES provided by agroecosystems at the global level, we explore their interconnections through network analysis, and analyse the interrelation between LUMC, CES and environmental conflicts. The review includes 155 peer-reviewed articles, representing empirical data from 81 countries. Twenty main categories of CES and their subcategories delivered by agroecosystems are identified. Through the network analysis we demonstrate how CES are interrelated, with agricultural heritage as a connecting core. In a comprehensive map, we further identify which LUMC types have influence upon specific CES categories, and what are the causes, outcomes of, and responses to environmental conflicts that emerge from these processes. CES and agroecosystems cannot be seen separately from one another, as a reflection of secular or recently-created relationships people have with their environments. While these relationships are dynamic, LUMC may lead to their impairment or even loss, with ensuing impacts on biocultural diversity. The resulting environmental conflicts push most frequently for greater participation of actors involved in farming, socio-cultural revalorisation of farmland activities and the promotion of multi-functionality.

AB  - Understanding distribution patterns and multitrophic interactions is critical for managing bat- and bird-mediated ecosystem senzices such as the suppression of pest and non-pest arthropods. Despite the ecological and economic importance of bats and birds in tropical forests, a.grotbrestry systems, and agricultural systems mixed with natural forest, a systematic review of their impact is still missing. A growing number of bird and bat exclosure experiments has improved our knowledge allowing new conclusions regarding their roles in food Webs and associated ecosystem seivices. Here, 1,ye review the distribution patterns of insectivorous birds and bats, their local and landscape drivers, and their effects on trophic cascades in tropical ecosystems. We report that for birds but not bats comanmity composition and relative importance of functional groups changes conspicuously from forests to habitats including both agricultural areas and forests, here termed 'forest-agri' habitats, with reduced representation of insectivores in the latter. In contrast to previous theory regarding trophic cascade strength, we find that birds and bats reduce the density and biomass of arthropods in the tropics with effect sizes similar to those in temperate and boreal communities. The relative importance of birds versus bats in regulating pest abundances varies with s(ason, geography and management. Birds and bats may even suppress tropical arthropod outbreaks, although positive effects on plant growth are not always report,ed. As both bats and birds are major ag,ents of pest suppression, a better understanding of the local and landscape factoi-s driving the variability of their impact is needed.

AB  - Despite recent advances in understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem-service provision, the links between the health of ecosystem-service providers and human health remain more uncertain. During the past decade, an increasing number of studies have argued for the positive impacts of healthy pollinator communities (defined as functionally and genetically diverse species assemblages that are sustained over time) on human health. Here, we begin with a systematic review of these impacts, finding only two studies that concomitantly quantified aspects of pollinator health and human health. Next, we identify relevant research relating to four pathways linking pollinator health and human health: nutrition, medicine provisioning, mental health and environmental quality. These benefits are obtained through improved pollination of nutritious crops and an estimated approximately 28 000 animal-pollinated medicinal plants; the provisioning of pollinator-derived products such as honey; the maintenance of green spaces and biocultural landscapes that improve mental health; and cleaner air, water and food resulting from pollinator-centred initiatives to reduce agrochemical use. We suggest that pollinator diversity could be a proxy for the benefits that landscapes provide to human health.This article is part of the theme issue 'Natural processes influencing pollinator health: from chemistry to landscapes'.

AB  - Climate change has been identified as one of the most important and immediate threats to biodiversity. In this study, we reviewed published papers about the impacts of climate change on Iran's biodiversity since 2014. We found that among the 37 studied species, 30 species will lose at least some parts of their distribution ranges. However, the distribution of seven species will increase. Climate change will have negative impacts on 81 percent of the studied species thus, it is a major problem for biodiversity conservation in Iran. We suggest that determining the effectiveness of Iran's protected areas for conservation of biodiversity, and ensuring their connectivity under current and future climatic conditions should be prioritized for future research in Iran.

AB  - Agricultural ecological compensation has drawn an increasingly broad range of interest since early 1990s. In recent years, the volume of the literature grows rapidly. As a result, a systematic review of the diverse research field and its current trends becomes essential. This paper surveys the literature of agricultural ecological compensation between 1990 and 2016. Specifically, by employing CiteSpace information visualization software, we firstly identified the research hotspots and evolution path and then illustrated the frontier and developing trend of the domain in core and broader perspectives. It is found that the focus of the academic community has always been researches on the theoretical policy and application of the payment for agro-ecosystem services, agricultural ecological compensation based on contingent valuation method, and ecological compensation of farmland landscape and organic food production as well as willingness to accept/pay for land use and ecological protection. Meanwhile, we also found that, in recent years, qualitative research has received more and more attention in the field of agricultural ecological compensation, since global warming, agricultural carbon emissions, and other emerging environmental issues have aroused widespread concern of the people around the world. Moreover, we believed that more and more scholars will employ case study methodology to analyze agricultural ecological compensation in specific systems, regions, or circumstances in the future.

AB  - The need to recognize diverse actors, their knowledge and values is being widely promoted as critical for sustainability in contemporary land use, natural resource management and conservation initiatives. However, in much of the case study literature, the value of including indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in the management and governance of landscapes tends to be overlooked and undervalued. Understanding ILK as comprising indigenous, local and traditional knowledge, this systematic review synthesizes how ILK has been viewed and incorporated into landscape-based studies; what processes, mechanisms and areas of focus have been used to integrate it; and the challenges and opportunities that arise in doing so. Queries from bibliographic databases (Web of Science, JSTOR, Scopus and Africa Wide) were employed. Findings from the review underscore that the literature and case studies that link landscapes and ILK are dominated by a focus on agricultural systems, followed by social-ecological systems, indigenous governance, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation and climate change studies, especially those related to early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. The growing importance of multi-stakeholder collaborations in local landscape research and the promotion of inclusive consultations have helped to bring ILK to the fore in the knowledge development process. This, in turn, has helped to support improved landscape management, governance and planning for more resilient landscapes. However, more research is needed to explore ways to more effectively link ILK and scientific knowledge in landscape studies, particularly in the co-management of these social-ecological systems. More studies that confirm the usefulness of ILK, recognize multiple landscape values and their interaction with structures and policies dealing with landscape management and conservation are necessary for enhanced sustainability.

AB  - The study presents the first comprehensive overview of ecosystem services (ES) research from the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), a region often referred to as the 'water tower of Asia'. Through a systematic literature search, we consolidated 439 peer-reviewed journal articles related to ecosystem services in the HKH. A bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine the temporal trend, geographical distribution, journal coverage, keywords used, authorship patterns, and collaboration networks in ES research on the region. The results showed an increasing trend in the publication of ecosystem services research on the HKH, with nearly 62 per cent of the journal articles being published in just the last five years. Most of the research has been carried out in China, followed by Nepal and India. Among the 166 scholarly journals publishing ecosystem services research on the HKH, Ecosystem Services and Sustainability are the most-used, followed by Science of the Total Environment. The keywords analysis identified a total of 1,460 keywords used in the articles on ES. Among them, 'ecosystem services' is the most commonly used, followed by 'China', 'Nepal', conservation', and `biodiversity.' The authorship analysis revealed that of the total of 1,386 authors, 1,000 co-authored ES publications. The top publishing authors are from the region; however, they are either affiliated with an international organization or based in developed countries. Research institutions from 56 countries have networked to conduct collaborative ES research in the HKH, so far. Although China has the highest number of publications, Nepal was identified as a principal collaborator with the widest country network. The existing research focuses on biophysical elements of ecosystem services, with very few published studies covering its social and political aspects and the management of ecosystem services. As the HKH is a contiguous ecosystem shared by eight countries, there is a need for regional analyses of ecosystem services. Our study concludes that ecosystem services being a multidisciplinary concept, research into it requires regional collaboration between multiple actors from varied disciplines, with a greater emphasis on social and political science, together with the biophysical sciences, for a more holistic understanding. Furthermore, it is important that ES research include the local context and issues to avoid the dominance of international perspectives and the marginalization of local concerns.

AB  - There is increasing global interest in employing nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and wetland restoration, to help reduce water risks to economies and society, including water pollution, floods, droughts and water scarcity, that are likely to become worse under future climates. Africa is exposed to many such water risks. Nature-based solutions for adaptation should be designed to benefit biodiversity and can also provide multiple co-benefits, such as carbon sequestration. A systematic review of over 10 000 publications revealed 150 containing 492 quantitative case studies related to the effectiveness of nature-based solutions for downstream water quantity and water quality (including sediment load) in Africa. The solutions assessed included landscape-scale interventions and patterns (forests and natural wetlands) and site-specific interventions (constructed wetlands and urban interventions e.g. soakaways). Consistent evidence was found that nature-based solutions can improve water quality. In contrast, evidence of their effectiveness for improving downstream water resource quantity was inconsistent, with most case studies showing a decline in water yield where forests (particularly plantations of non-native species) and wetlands are present. The evidence further suggests that restoration of forests and floodplain wetlands can reduce flood risk, and their conservation can prevent future increases in risk; in contrast, this is not the case for headwater wetlands. Potential trade-offs identified include nature-based solutions reducing flood risk and pollution, whilst decreasing downstream water resource quantity. The evidence provides a scientific underpinning for policy and planning for nature-based solutions to water-related risks in Africa, though implementation will require local knowledge.

AB  - Global change, population growth, and urbanization have been exerting a severe influence on the environment, including the social system and ecosystem. To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their relationships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being. This study provides an enhanced understanding of the nexus among the three aspects and a reference for future studies to mitigate the relevant problems.

AB  - Work-Life Blending refers to the permeability and dissolution of boundaries between work and personal life, bringing these domains closer together. However, a comprehensive, holistic definition or conceptualisation of Work-Life-Blending is currently lacking. This research aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review to define and clarify the concept. The primary objective is to identify the key factors and dimensions of Work-Life-Blending by reviewing the current state of research, and by offering a clear and precise conceptual framework to guide further research in developing measurable and concrete concepts. We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to achieve this, drawing on keyword-based searches. We searched for English or German manuscripts in the electronic databases Business Source Premier and PsycARTICLES, using keywords such as "blending," "blurring," "fusion," "Entgrenzung," "Verschmelzung," "Vermischung," "boundary," "border," or "demarcation" in combination with "work" and "life." From 1,400 screened references between 2000 and 2023, we identified 302 eligible articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 51 records were retained. Employing a holistic approach, we developed a coding scheme to analyse the articles focusing on antecedents, processes, and outcomes of Work-Life-Blending. Articles were prioritized based on their impact, relevance, and data content. Our analysis revealed a diverse field, and we adopted Clark's central concepts (2000) to categorize Work-Life Blending into four key areas: Domains, Borders, Individual, and Interindividual. Structural analysis allowed us to gain deeper insights into the multifaceted nature of the research field. Diversification was evident in studies exploring various aspects, such as the combination of dimensions (e.g., organizational and individual factors), correlations between factors (e.g., working conditions), and the introduction of new constructs (e.g., motivational processes). Our research addresses a significant knowledge gap in the field of Work-Life-Blending, making valuable contributions to the existing body of knowledge. By examining key categories and proposing an extended definition, this study provides a robust foundation for further investigations. As a result, we established a classification of the determinants. Given the high degree of diversification, we offer a comprehensive framework for future research, contributing to a deeper understanding of Work-Life Blending.

AB  - Culture and economy are two of the most important spheres of society. Their interaction is a complex and often contradictory process that depends on the specific socio-cultural environment, time, place, national development priorities, etc. The objective of the research is to carry out a systematic analysis of official policies related to culture and cultural literacy in Latvia. The focus is on the documents published in the period 2008 - 2018. By way of a systematic review of relevant policy documents, it examines how the cultural sphere is promoted, how the population's cultural literacy, which can directly influence the economic development, is improved, and which are the most important issues of cultural policy. A systematic search for eligible sources examining cultural literacy education, defined as formal and informal education activities related to cultural identity, cultural practices and cultural heritage, was carried out by employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. A thematic analysis of the documents was undertaken using an iterative, inductive approach to the generation of codes and themes guided by the review aims and objectives. Cultural literacy has been designated as strategically important for sustainable development in policy documents of Latvia. The long-term planning documents in Latvia seek to base the country's future development on a core of values that place less pressure on the utilisation of physical resources. This approach foregrounds the value (and potential) of human capital and emphasises creativity, openness to the new, tolerance, cooperation (that contributes to both cultural development and social cohesion), and participation. Tangible and intangible public investment in these areas will also contribute to the overall economic development of the country. There are signs of improving the country's economic growth potential in the system of education, which is undergoing significant changes, leading to the idea of promoting young people's responsibility and ability to build a creative economy-based, highly developed country.

AB  - Street trees are components of the urban forest that receive considerable attention across academic and professional disciplines. They are also one of the most common types of urban tree that people routinely encounter. A systematic review methodology was used to examine contemporary urban street tree research across natural and social science disciplines. The records collected (n = 429) were published between January 1997 and the mid-2020s and were coded for descriptive information (e.g., publishing journal and geography of study areas) as well as emergent focal research areas (e.g., ecosystem services, economic valuation, and inventory methods). From this sample, there has been considerable growth in street tree literature over time and across research themes, especially following major turning points in the field of urban forestry. Regulating ecosystem functions/services of street trees, especially cooling, has had the greatest attention in the literature, but other robust areas of research also exist, including the utility of pruning waste as construction materials, the benefits and disservices to human health and safety, and indicators of environmental (in)justice. Opportunities for future research and implications for research and practice are also discussed.

AB  - Background: It has been recognized that urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing many landscape services. The research aimed at identifying the main knowledge gaps in this framework and to support urban planning, taking into account the spatial configuration of green areas through a pilot study area, and mapping urban landscape services. Methods: In this research, (1) a systematic review, analyzed through a network analysis; (2) an urban pilot study to map the Urban Green Index and, jointly, the spatial composition and configuration of urban green areas, through the integration of three landscape metrics; and (3) the mapping of Urban Landscape Services Index have been carried out. Results: The 37% of the reviewed articles focused on regulating services, while the network analysis identified four clusters. The total Urban Green Index was 26%, and some districts showed a percentage that surpassed it. The total overall Green Connectivity Index was 21%. Some districts were the best providers of landscape services. Conclusions: This research was in line with the EU Joint Science for Policy Report suggesting giving emphasis to the spatial pattern map of green spaces in European cities to provide spatial data available for decision-makers in relation to GI deployment.

AB  - Global initiatives have raised awareness of the need for cross-departmental and cross-sectoral activities to support urban health, sustainability, and equity, with respective indicators routinely used as a way to catalyze and monitor action toward pre-defined goals. Despite the existence of at least 145 urban health indicator (UHI) tools globally, there has been very little research on the use of indicators by policy- and decision-makers; more attention has been devoted to their development and validation. This paper describes the second part of a two-part systematic review of the characteristics (part A) and use (part B, this part) of UHI tools by municipal built environment policy- and decision-makers. Part B is a narrative synthesis of studies on the use of UHI tools. This PRISMA-P compliant review follows a mixed methods sequential explanatory design. The search was conducted using seven bibliographic databases, grey literature searches, and key journal hand searches. Ten studies describing the use of ten UHI tools in seven countries were included in the narrative synthesis, resulting in development of a theory of change (ToC). We found that both expert-led and participatory indicator projects can be underpinned by research evidence and residents' knowledge. Our findings contradict the dominant view of indicator use in policy-making as a linear process, highlighting a number of technical, organizational, political, knowledge, and contextual factors that affect their use. Participatory UHI tools with community involvement were generally more effective at supporting "health in all policies" and "whole-of-society" approaches to governing healthy cities than expert-led processes. UHI tool producers proposed a range of techniques to address urban health complexity characteristics. Finally, in combining data from both parts of the review, we found that potentially important UHI tool features, such as neighbourhood-scale data, were influential in the use of indicators by built environment policy- and decision-makers.

AB  - Meta-analysis is a powerful research summarization technique. In the medical field, for example, meta-analysis is an indispensable tool as part of systematic reviews for healthcare decision making. The advantages of meta-analysis have also been recognized in the fields of ecology and conservation biology with the method becoming increasingly popular since the 1990s. ``Meta-analysis'', however, is not well-defined in these fields, but is regularly confused with other summary analysis techniques, such as multiple regression methods, vote-counting or other quantitative analyses. We argue that this vague and inconsistent utilization of the term is problematic, because a meta-analysis typically provides scientifically rigorous results. We therefore advocate a consistent and well-defined usage of the term in our disciplines, based on the standardized definition applied in the medical sciences. We searched the Web of Knowledge for meta-analyses in the subject area ``biodiversity conservation'' and evaluated the usage of the term ``meta-analysis''. Based on meta-analysis literature from the medical sciences, we determined steps that in our opinion are mandatory when performing meta-analysis and rated articles according to these steps. In the first round of rating, we assessed the usage of four `` technical'' steps that are normally applied in meta-analytical software. In the second round, we only evaluated the highly rated articles from the first round. We considered three steps regarding more qualitative aspects of interpretation and results presentation. Of the 133 evaluated articles in the first round, only 45% fulfilled all technical requirements for a meta-analysis, while 25% did not fulfill any of the requisite steps. In the second round, only one article of 83 fulfilled all requisite steps, while 22% did not fulfill any requirement. Our findings highlight the ambiguous and vague usage of the term ``meta-analysis'' in ecology and conservation biology and underline the importance of a consistent and clear definition. We conclude with recommendations on how the term should be applied in the future.

AB  - In civil society we expect that policy and management decisions will be made using the best available evidence. Yet, it is widely known that there are many barriers that limit the extent to which that occurs. One way to overcome these barriers is via robust, comprehensive, transparent and repeatable evidence syntheses (such as systematic reviews) that attempt to minimize various forms of bias to present a summary of existing knowledge for decision-making purposes. Relative to other disciplines (e.g., health care, education), such evidence-based decision-making remains relatively nascent for environment management despite major threats to humanity, such as the climate, pollution and biodiversity crises demonstrating that human well-being is inextricably linked to the biophysical environment. Fortunately, there are a growing number of environmental evidence syntheses being produced that can be used by decision makers. It is therefore an opportune time to reflect on the science and practice of evidence-based decision-making in environment management to understand the extent to which evidence syntheses are embraced and applied in practice. Here we outline a number of key questions related to the use of environmental evidence that need to be explored in an effort to enhance evidence-based decision-making. There is an urgent need for research involving methods from social science, behavioural sciences, and public policy to understand the basis for patterns and trends in environmental evidence use (or misuse or ignorance). There is also a need for those who commission and produce evidence syntheses, as well as the end users of these syntheses to reflect on their experiences and share them with the broader evidence-based practice community to identify needs and opportunities for advancing the entire process of evidence-based practice. It is our hope that the ideas shared here will serve as a roadmap for additional scholarship that will collectively enhance evidence-based decision-making and ultimately benefit the environment and humanity.

AB  - Forest management planning requires the specification of measurable objectives as desired future conditions at spatial extents ranging from stands to landscapes and temporal extents ranging from a single growing season to several centuries. Effective implementation of forest management requires understanding current conditions and constraints well enough to apply the appropriate silvicultural strategies to produce desired future conditions, often for multiple objectives, at varying spatial and temporal extents. We administered an online survey to forest managers in the eastern US to better understand how wildlife scientists could best provide information to help meet wildlife-related habitat objectives. We then examined more than 1000 review papers on bird-vegetation relationships in the eastern US compiled during a systematic review of the primary literature to see how well this evidence-base meets the information needs of forest managers. We identified two main areas where wildlife scientists could increase the relevance and applicability of their research. First, forest managers want descriptions of wildlife species-vegetation relationships using the operational metrics of forest management (forest type, tree species composition, basal area, tree density, stocking rates, etc.) summarized at the operational spatial units of forest management (stands, compartments, and forests). Second, forest managers want information about how to provide wildlife habitats for many different species with varied habitat needs across temporal extents related to the ecological processes of succession after harvest or natural disturbance (1-2 decades) or even longer periods of stand development. We provide examples of review papers that meet these information needs of forest managers and topic-specific bibliographies of additional review papers that may contain actionable information for foresters who wish to meet wildlife management objectives. We suggest that wildlife scientists become more familiar with the extensive grey literature on forest bird-vegetation relationships and forest management that is available in natural resource management agency reports. We also suggest that wildlife scientists could reconsider everything from the questions they ask, the metrics they report on, and the way they allocate samples in time and space, to provide more relevant and actionable information to forest managers.

AB  - Urban mobility is a challenge in cities undergoing growing urbanisation, requiring a shift in behaviour towards more sustainable means of transportation. To investigate how technology can mediate the process of behaviour change, particularly in the context of smart cities, this paper presents a systematic literature review. Three areas are of interest: the utilised technology, behaviour change strategies, and citizen participation in the development process. A total of 14 different applications were included in the final review. The findings show that mobile devices are being prevalently used, persuasive strategies are foremost mentioned, and end-user involvement is happening late in the development process, serving primarily testing purposes. This points out that there are still various unexplored possibilities. It is suggested that future research should explore opportunities stemming from ubiquitous technology, employ behaviour change strategies grounded in reflective learning, and promote citizen involvement with participatory methods.

AB  - Although nonadherence to prescribed therapies is widespread, it is particularly problematic with highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. This review of > 50 studies in the area of pediatric HIV infection revealed varying methods for assessing antiretroviral adherence with a wide range of estimates of adherence. Correlates of adherence could be grouped as those relating to the medication, the patient, and the caregiver/family, with many conflicting findings and a lack of theory guiding the research. Only 8 studies, mainly small feasibility or pilot investigations, evaluated highly active antiretroviral therapy adherence interventions in pediatric populations. We conclude with specific recommendations for assessment and clinical management of adherence and discuss directions for future research in this area.

AB  - Land susceptibility to wind erosion is governed by complex multiscale interactions between soil erodibility and non-erodible roughness elements populating the land surface. Numerous wind erosion modelling systems have been developed to quantify soil loss and dust emissions at the field, regional and global scales. All of these models require some component that defines the susceptibility of the land surface to erosion, ie, land erodibility. The approaches taken to characterizing land erodibility have advanced through time, following developments in empirical and process-based research into erosion mechanics, and the growing availability of moderate to high-resolution spatial data that can be used as model inputs. Most importantly, the performance of individual models is highly dependent on the means by which soil erodibility and surface roughness effects are represented in their land erodibility characterizations. This paper presents a systematic review of a selection of wind erosion models developed over the last 50 years. The review evaluates how land erodibility has been modelled at different spatial and temporal scales, and in doing this the paper identifies concepts behind parameterizations of land erodibility, trends in model development, and recent progress in the representation of soil, vegetation and land management effects on the susceptibility of landscapes to wind erosion. The paper provides a synthesis of the capabilities of the models in assessing dynamic patterns of land erodibility change, and concludes by identifying key areas that require research attention to enhance our capacity to achieve this task.

AB  - A large and growing body of empirical research shows that social relationships and the networks these relationships constitute are influential in explaining the processes of knowledge creation, diffusion, absorption, and use. The authors refer to such networks as "knowledge networks." They advance an understanding of knowledge networks at multiple levels by conducting a systematic review and analysis of empirical research published on this topic in leading management, psychology, sociology, and economics journals. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that organizes the knowledge networks literature, which they use to review extant empirical research within and across multiple disciplines and levels of analysis. They identify points of coherence and conflict in theoretical arguments and empirical results within and across levels and identify emerging themes and promising areas for future research.

AB  - In this article, we propose that ecosystem services (ES) should be studied integrating social participation and the narrative of social actors. We analyzed the ES literature (1996-2020) in Latin America (LA), basing our review on the concept that the study of this topic should be transdisciplinary and post-normal (i.e., extended peer communities). We prepared the review using the Scopus (R) and Web of ScienceTM (WoS) databases. We found 1069 articles related to social participation in ES studies in 20 LA countries, identifying 310 articles for further analysis using screening and eligibility protocols. We also used a random sample (n = 50) of the 310 articles for a detailed analysis of social participation and extended peer communities. Results showed that articles increased from seven in 2010 to 39 per year from 2015 to 2019. English is the primary language used (91% of the articles), with only one journal accepting publications in Spanish. The most common collaboration combination has been one LA author and one or more non-LA authors (41% of the articles). The semantic network analysis showed 35 thematic clusters, with the most common corresponding to ES protection and provision issues. Direct social participation was included in 62% of the articles, mainly through interviews; however, consultancy processes have dominated the participatory perspective of the authors without transformative involvement. We discuss article language and low inter-countries collaboration, both influencing the lack of social participation required for the transdisciplinary analysis of ES.

AB  - Background: Compulsory citizenship behaviors (CCBs) are increasingly endorsed and expected of workers in contexts where managerial worker protections are low and performance demands on workers are high. Although studies on compulsory citizenship behaviors have shown a significant increase in recent years, the literature still lacks a comprehensive meta-analysis. To fill this gap the purpose of this study is to synthesize the collective outcomes of prior quantitative research on CCBs with the objective of identifying the factors linked to the concept and offering a primary reference for future researchers.Methods: Forty-three different correlates with CCBs were synthesized. The dataset of this meta-analysis consists of 53 independent samples with a sample size of 17.491, contributing to 180 effect sizes. PRISMA flow diagram and PICOS framework were used for the study design.Result: Results showed only gender and age were significant among demographic characteristics related to CCBs. Correlates between CCBs and counterproductive workplace behaviors, felt obligation, work-family conflict, organizational-based self-esteem, organizational cynicism, burnout, anger toward the organization, and work alienation were found as large. We also found turnover intention, moral disengagement, careerism, abusive supervision, citizenship pressure, job stress, facades of conformity, and feeling trusted to be moderately related to CCBs. Next, there was a small relationship between CCBs and social loafing. On the other hand, LMX, psychological safety, organizational identification, organizational justice, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and job autonomy were found as significant deterrents of CCBs. These results suggest that CCBs flourish in contexts with low levels of worker protection and low road practices to people management.Conclusion: In sum, we found solid cumulative evidence that CCBs are a harmful and undesirable phenomenon for employees and organizations. Also, positive correlations of felt obligation, feeling trusted, and organization-based self-esteem with CCBs, showed that, contrary to general acceptance, positive factors could also cause CCBs. Lastly, we found CCBs as a dominant phenomenon in eastern culture.

AB  - Climate change has emerged as one of the major threats to biodiversity and the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is facing the challenges due to a higher rate of elevation dependent warming and erratic rainfall. The rich biodiversity and bounty of ecosystem services provided by this 'water tower' and the 'Third Pole' are under higher risk. Though there is scattered and sectoral knowledge available, comprehensive understanding on climate change and its impact on biodiversity is lacking in the HKH. To fill this gap, a systematic literature review using search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) was undertaken to look at temporal and spatial trends of research focusing on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The increasing trend and evolution of research from sectoral to multidisciplinarity approach with increasing focus on impacts suggested a strong influence from regional priority and global discourse. There is a clear pattern of biophysical and environmental focused research in the early phase of the 1990s to societal concerns highlighting vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation measures at the later phases. The review also revealed an increasing trend in multidisciplinary, networking and bringing innovative tools in research linking climate change and biodiversity. However, the research showed greater focus in the Tibetan plateau and alpine ecosystem with decreasing interest in the forest ecosystems, and a very negligible focus on wetlands. Studies on impact assessments are increasing but at a relatively low rate. Better representation of investments based on vulnerable ecosystems, underrepresented countries and collaborative regional research on emerging priority areas such as restoration and larger scale nature-based solutions could contribute to climate resilience in the HKH.

AB  - As human populations grow and natural habitat shrinks, conflicts between humans and large carnivores are inevitable. Thus, effective interventions for mitigating or preventing human-carnivore conflicts are necessary for promoting coexistence. Despite extensive efforts by researchers to address the human-carnivore conflict in Tanzania, there have been no attempts to review the potential mitigation and preventative interventions in the region. A systematic review of 43 scientific literature published between 2000 and 2020 was conducted using Science Direct, Wiley Online Library and Google Scholar search engines to evaluate the current status and research trends of human-carnivore conflict management in Tanzania. This literature review also identified the most commonly recommended conflict mitigation and preventative interventions, and generated management recommendations. Results showed that research on human-carnivore conflict management is deeply biased, where most studies were conducted in the northern region of Tanzania. Most studies recommended preventative interventions (54%), followed by community interventions (30%) and a few mitigation interventions studies (16%). Only two articles included in this review evaluated the effectiveness of interventions. Overall results showed that the most recommended preventative intervention was fortified bomas (20 publications), while the most recommended mitigation intervention was ecotourism benefit-sharing schemes (9 publications) and the most recommended community intervention was community education and awareness (21 publications). Therefore, an integrated approach that combines livestock management strategies (e.g., promoting the use of fortified bomas); community interventions (e.g., increasing community conservation awareness and education) and equitable ecotourism benefit-sharing with park-adjacent communities should be adopted to address human-carnivore conflict in the region.

AB  - Global economic change and policy interventions are driving transitions from long-fallow swidden (LFS) systems to alternative land uses in Southeast Asia's uplands. This study presents a systematic review of how these transitions impact upon livelihoods and ecosystem services in the region. Over 17 000 studies published between 1950 and 2015 were narrowed, based on relevance and quality, to 93 studies for further analysis. Our analysis of land-use transitions from swidden to intensified cropping systems showed several outcomes: more households had increased overall income, but these benefits came at significant cost such as reductions of customary practice, socio-economic wellbeing, livelihood options, and staple yields. Examining the effects of transitions on soil properties revealed negative impacts on soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity, and aboveground carbon. Taken together, the proximate and underlying drivers of the transitions from LFS to alternative land uses, especially intensified perennial and annual cash cropping, led to significant declines in pre-existing livelihood security and the ecosystem services supporting this security. Our results suggest that policies imposing land-use transitions on upland farmers so as to improve livelihoods and environments have been misguided; in the context of varied land uses, swidden agriculture can support livelihoods and ecosystem services that will help buffer the impacts of climate change in Southeast Asia.

AB  - Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a substantial societal burden and various factors affect their causation, recovery, and prognosis. Management of MSDs is complex and requires multifaceted interventions. Given the challenges of MSDs and their continued burden, it is possible that additional elements could impact these disorders that have not been fully researched, for example, indoor environmental quality. Our previous review provided preliminary evidence that healthy building determinants (HBDs) are associated with the risk of back and neck pain. However, the relationship of HBDs with extremity MSDs and general MSDs (i.e., MSDs involving multiple body regions or in which body regions were unspecified in the original reports) has not been formally studied. The purpose of this review was to conduct a systematic literature review to assess the relationship of HBDs with extremity and general MSDs (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022314832). PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and PEDRo databases were searched through April 2022. Inclusion criteria for study eligibility were as follows: humans of ages >= 18 years, reported on one or more of eight HBDs (1. air quality and ventilation, 2. dust and pests, 3. lighting and views, 4. moisture, 5. noise, 6. safety and security, 7. thermal health, 8. water quality), and compared these HBDs with extremity MSDs or general MSDs, original research, English. Exclusion criteria were as follows: articles not published in peer-reviewed journals, full-text articles unavailable. Review procedures were conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Empirical evidence statements were developed for 33 pairwise comparisons of HBDs with MSDs. The search uncovered 53 eligible studies with 178,532 participants. A total of 74.6% (39/53) of the studies were cross-sectional and 81.1% (43/53) were fair quality. Overall, the majority of uncovered evidence indicates that HBDs are related to risk of extremity and general MSDs. Nineteen comparisons support that as HBDs worsen, the risk of MSDs increases. Six comparisons had conflicting evidence. Three comparisons support that poor HBDs are not related to increased risk of extremity and general MSDs. Five comparisons had no evidence. This systematic review builds upon previous work to provide useful starting points to enhance awareness about the HBD-MSD relationship. These findings can help inform research and public health efforts aimed at addressing suboptimal HBDs through appropriate interventions to improve the lives of those suffering from MSDs.

AB  - Over the last few decades, resilience and its related practices have been at the core of responding challenges in the Global South and North. We should, however, be conscious of its gaps for many reasons. First, environmental plans not attuned to local traditions can create cultural conflicts. Second, the politicised nature of international agreements poses unintended consequences as societies find it hard to engage in such agreements. Third, uncertainties about changes in socio-ecological systems reduce people's adaptive capacity. Without an awareness of these inconsistencies, policymakers risk impeding societies' adaptation to environmental change. By doing a systematic review of articles from academic and policy publications, this paper explores repercussions for environmental governance, illuminating key concerns in protected areas, climate change policy, and hydropower systems.

AB  - A shift towards evidence-based conservation and environmental management over the last two decades has resulted in an increased use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses as tools to combine existing scientific evidence. However, to guide policy making decisions in conservation and management, the conclusions of meta-analyses need to remain stable for at least some years. Alarmingly, numerous recent studies indicate that the magnitude, statistical significance, and even the sign of the effects reported in the literature might change over relatively short time periods. We argue that such rapid temporal changes in cumulative evidence represent a real threat to policy making in conservation and environmental management and call for systematic monitoring of temporal changes in evidence and exploration of their causes.

AB  - We conducted a systematic global review of differences between timber plantations and pasture lands in terms of animal and plant species richness and abundance, and assessed the results using meta-analysis techniques. Our principal aim was to test the hypothesis that plantations contain higher species richness or abundance than pasture. Of the 1967 studies of potential relevance, 66 provided biological monitoring information and 36 met the requirements for meta-analyses. Sufficient data were available for meta-analyses to be conducted comparing the species richness and abundance of plantations and pasture lands for five taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, reptiles/amphibians, mammals, and birds. Within each taxon there was considerable variation in the difference between species richness and abundance between plantations and pasture lands. Birds and reptile/amphibians exhibited significantly higher species richness, and mammals exhibited significantly higher abundance, in plantations than in pasture lands which lacked remnant vegetation. Reptile/amphibian species richness was significantly higher in plantations in general. No significant differences in species richness were found for mammals, plants, or invertebrates, and no significant differences in abundance were found for birds, reptiles/amphibians, invertebrates, or plants. It is only within the presence of taxonomic caveats (i.e. reptiles/amphibians), or specific landscape features (i.e. absence of remnant vegetation within pasture), that it can be concluded that plantations support higher species richness or abundance than pasture land. We emphasize that caution is warranted when making general statements about the inherent biodiversity value of diverse and broadly-defined land-uses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive plants can significantly impact the diversity of understory ground flora and forest regeneration in eastern North America. However, managing invasive plants has resulted in positive, negative, or neutral effects on key ecosystem components depending on treatment type, duration, and intensity. Management may also result in short-term control, but legacy effects from prior land use or secondary invasions may hamper desired long-term outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the invasive plant management literature for eastern North American forests to examine treatment outcomes for invasive and native plants, tree regeneration, and secondary invasions. Our review included 165 articles with few papers published in the 1980s but the number of papers increasing through time thereafter. A variety of control methods were used, including herbicide applications, prescribed burning, torching, girdling, clipping, mastication, soil amendments, flooding, enrichment plantings, and biocontrol, as well as combinations of these treatments. Species included some of the most common forest invaders, such as the privets (Ligustrum spp.), honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), buckthorns (Rhamnus cathartica and Frangula alnus), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum), cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), and Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera). The literature also included recent invaders in eastern North America, such as Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) and fig buttercup (Ficaria verna). Findings suggest that invasive plant control efficacy is highly variable and context dependent. Information on long-term effects is limited because most studies reported on findings occurring within a few years of treatment. However, long-term success may be limited without additional management (e.g., enrichment plantings, artificial tree regeneration, re-establishing historic fire regimes, reducing herbivore densities) that ameliorates impacts from past land-use, disturbance history, or other factors. We suggest that future studies and the development of control tactics consider comprehensive approaches to building resilience in forest communities where invasive plants are only one aspect of the forest management continuum.

AB  - We revisit the study of organizational goals, outcomes, and assessment of performance that together define the process leading to 'success'. We begin by conducting a systematic review of existing research which allows us to develop an integrative framework discussing this large body of work. We then describe contemporary research examples in light of our proposed framework. We close by proposing four new areas to continue to advance the field: reconceptualizing performance (and success) as achievement of goals; diversity of goal systems in research designs, and their relationship with the purpose of an organization; multilevel and temporal dynamics; and governance of goal setting. Overall, our efforts inform future research on organizational success in the context of our new societal challenges and accomplish the intriguing task of re-defining success in management studies.

AB  - The field of animal movement ecology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past few decades with the advent of sophisticated technology, advanced analytical tools, and multiple frameworks and paradigms to address key ecological problems. Unlike the longer history and faster growth of the field in North America, Europe, and Africa, movement ecology in Asia has only recently been gaining momentum. Here, we provide a review of the field from studies based in India over the last 11 years (2011-2021) curated from the database, Scopus, and search engine, Google Scholar. We identify current directions in the research objectives, taxa studied, tracking technology and the biogeographic regions in which animals were tracked, considering the years since the last systematic review of movement ecology research in the country. As an indication of the growing interest in this field, there has been a rapid increase in the number of publications over the last decade. Class Mammalia continues to dominate the taxa tracked, with tiger and leopard being the most common species studied across publications. Invertebrates and other small and medium-sized animals, as well as aquatic animals, in comparison, are understudied and remain among the important target taxa for tracking in future studies. As in the previous three decades, researchers have focussed on characterising home ranges and habitat use of animals. There is, however, a notable shift to examine the movement decision of animals in human-modified landscapes, although efforts to use movement ecology to understand impacts of climate change remain missing. Given the biogeographic and taxonomic diversity of India, and the fact that the interface between anthropogenic activity and wildlife interactions is increasing, we suggest ways in which the field of movement ecology can be expanded to facilitate ecological insights and conservation efforts. With the advancement of affordable technologies and the availability of analytical tools, the potential to expand the field of movement ecology, shift research foci, and gain new insights is now prime.

AB  - Development research and practice often use a capitals framework to study and encourage community improvement (Flora et al. 2015; Pender et al., 2014; Scoones 2009). This includes capitals such as human, social, natural, infrastructural, political, economic, and cultural. Despite robust scholarship on a variety of capital types, the conceptualization and use of cultural capital in community development remains unsettled and often underdeveloped. To help address this, we have conducted a systemic literature review of peer-reviewed community development scholarship in the United States employing the concept of cultural capital between 2001 and 2021. We find that the various ways cultural capital is understood and deployed are reflective of disciplinary and practitioner assumptions and norms. Though cultural capital is often not well defined, our review suggests that it tends to be viewed as creative industries and amenities; a distinct social group; knowledge, values, attitudes, norms, and beliefs; place-based characteristics; and/or an exercise of power. A number of methodological tradeoffs are discussed as well as the symbolic foundation of the concept. We posit that cultural capital might be better understood as a meta-capital, as a resource that only registers through the other capitals as opposed to something separate from them. Reflexivity on the part of researchers and practitioners is vital to deploying cultural capital for community development due to the impact such characterization can have on determining which culture matters or not, and how this can shape how other assets are mobilized. Due its place-based, symbolic, and meta qualities, cultural capital may need to be understood differently from the other capitals which has important implications for research and practice - namely the importance of community participation in determining what matters.

AB  - Groundwater resources have deteriorated in many regions as a result of excessive use to satisfy increasing water demands. Furthermore, climate change has an influence on groundwater in terms of quality and quantity. An investigation of climate change impacts on quality and quantity of groundwater is vital for effective planning and sustainable management of groundwater resources. Despite of the importance of climate change impact studies on groundwater resources, climate change impact studies related to surface water resources have attracted more attention from the research community, leading to limited understanding of the groundwater and climate change relationship. In this paper, a systematic review of the latest literature related to the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge was carried out to provide guidance for future studies.

AB  - Smart cites are rapidly gaining momentum but our understanding of their underlying management framework has to a large extent been unexplored. Under the different initiatives within the label of smart cities, there is no systematic understanding of how city decision makers manage the configuration of resources and processes within the dynamic urban environment. This research in progress paper develops a research agenda on the capabilities of smart city management by synthesising the findings of 72 papers. Further to consolidating the enabling aspects of technology and data as key resources is smart city development, the review leads to the identification of dynamic, operational, cultural and management capabilities. The paper concludes by discussing the value of this approach for future work in the area of smart cities.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most widely accepted methods of marine management. MPAs are not, however, always placed such that they can maximize impact on conservation and livelihoods. Current MPA guidelines fall short in focusing primarily on biophysical criteria, overlooking interrelated socioeconomic factors. We identified 32 socioeconomic factors that influence whether MPA placement has an impact on biodiversity and/or livelihoods and weighted the quality of evidence using a novel "Evidence for Impact" Score. Results suggest that stakeholder engagement, poverty, population density, and strong leadership have most potential to positively impact biodiversity and/or livelihoods, but the direction of impact (i.e., positive or negative) can be context-dependent. We found a generally poor evidence base for impact evaluation of socioeconomic factors: though some factors were highly cited, few studies actually evaluate impact. Results indicate the need for a more interdisciplinary approach to MPA placement and more empirical studies that assess impact.

AB  - The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus is rapidly expanding in scholarly literature and policy settings as a novel way to address complex resource and development challenges. The nexus approach aims to identify tradeoffs and synergies of water, energy, and food systems, internalize social and environmental impacts, and guide development of cross-sectoral policies. However, while the WEF nexus offers a promising conceptual approach, the use of WEF nexus methods to systematically evaluate water, energy, and food interlinkages or support development of socially and politically-relevant resource policies has been limited.
   This paper reviews WEF nexus methods to provide a knowledge base of existing approaches and promote further development of analytical methods that align with nexus thinking. The systematic review of 245 journal articles and book chapters reveals that (a) use of specific and reproducible methods for nexus assessment is uncommon (less than one-third); (b) nexus methods frequently fall short of capturing interactions among water, energy, and food-the very linkages they conceptually purport to address; (c) assessments strongly favor quantitative approaches (nearly three-quarters); (d) use of social science methods is limited (approximately one-quarter); and (e) many nexus methods are confined to disciplinary silos-only about one-quarter combine methods from diverse disciplines and less than one-fifth utilize both quantitative and qualitative approaches.
   To help overcome these limitations, we derive four key features of nexus analytical tools and methods-innovation, context, collaboration, and implementation-from the literature that reflect WEF nexus thinking. By evaluating existing nexus analytical approaches based on these features, we highlight 18 studies that demonstrate promising advances to guide future research. This paper finds that to address complex resource and development challenges, mixed-methods and transdisciplinary approaches are needed that incorporate social and political dimensions of water, energy, and food; utilize multiple and interdisciplinary approaches; and engage stakeholders and decision-makers.

AB  - Climate change impacts, the resulting spatiotemporal changes, and growing uncertainty exert pressure on city leaders and policy makers to create climate adaptive development strategies worldwide. This article introduces climate urbanism as a new development paradigm that advocates for a climate adaptive urban development process, safeguarding urban economics and infrastructure, and ensuring equitable implementation of related strategies. The objective of this article is to determine how far a climate vulnerable city in the Global South has progressed toward climate urbanism. The study employs Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to develop a conceptual framework. Afterward, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and indexing are used to develop a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to assess the selected climate sensitive factors related to climate urbanism. Findings reveal that the city of Khulna's climate urbanism index score is 0.36, which is extremely low and denotes subpar urban performance. 'Climate Conscious Governance' and 'Climate Smart Infrastructure' contribute little, while 'Adaptive and Dynamic Urban Form' and 'Urban Ecosystem Services' contribute even less. The binary logistic regression analysis reveals the significant indicators of (transformative) climate urbanism. The article provides a critical lens for stakeholders to evaluate climate urbanism and promote urban sustainability in the face of climate change.

AB  - BackgroundCommunication is a central tool used to manage the balance between outdoor recreation and environmental protection in natural areas. Several studies have evaluated different communication measures in case studies, but rarely are these measures compared across contexts. We review the literature guided by the question: what is the scope of evidence of on-site communication to change human behavior towards a more sustainable direction in outdoor recreation? Taking natural areas as our starting point, we map research-based distribution and abundance of communication measures, with emphasis on their outcomes and study design.MethodsThe target population for our mapping review are outdoor recreationists and nature-based tourists who visit natural or near-natural settings. We examined studies that have crafted written, oral and visual intervention measures to change behavior by using persuasion, education and information rather than legal restrictions or bans. Examples of challenges addressed with communication measures include proper waste disposal, using designated trails, minimizing wear and tear at campsites, avoid disturbing wildlife, and encouraging appropriate and safe behavior. We did not restrict our search geographically. We searched publication databases for peer-reviewed published articles (WoS, Scopus) and forward and backward citation chasing. To identify grey literature we used the database IRMA and internet searches in Google Scholar supplemented with specialist searches. Inclusion criteria and related search terms were based on PICO and included population (P: people participating in outdoor recreation in natural settings), terms that denoted intervention (I: on-site communication measures in situ vs. C: no communication measures) and terms that denoted outcome (O: changed behavior). We screened first by title and abstract and finally full text. For each article selected for full-text screening, metadata was extracted on key variables of interest such as behavior category, context, targeted population, study design and outcomes.Review findingsOverall, we identified 54 studies that were assessed in the review. Our review documents growing academic interest looking at actual behavior change in outdoor recreation. Theory is often subsidiary to attempted behavioral change via communication and different situational aspects, such as targeted visitor populations and environmental context, as well as psychological factors remain underexplored in the literature. The primary communication medium in the reviewed papers is passive use of signs. Awareness raising is the dominant communication mode, but other modes such as emotions, identity, and social norms are common. The geographic distribution of the studies is highly skewed to the United States.ConclusionsThe amassed studies have an uneven focus on different settings and mediums used to change behavior. Research could benefit from investigating different contexts and the state of the natural environment before and after interventions. We advocate for casting a wider disciplinary net and interest in qualitative investigations to produce data-rich studies of where and how sustainable behavior is encouraged and eventually achieved. Collectively, different disciplinary perspectives are required to understand the aspects that contribute to sustainable, and sustained, behavior change. It is important to distinguish what aspects of behavior change could be generalized across settings, and which purely contextual aspects drive behavior change.

AB  - Urban morphology is examined in various disciplines as it is associated with a range of ecological, social, and economic sustainable outcomes. Yet there is a lack of clarity and consensus on measuring urban morphology indicators that will allow interdisciplinary scholarship at a city, regional, or global scale for integrated sustainable solutions. This systematic review aims to 1) develop a taxonomy of measures of urban form indicators linked to sustainable outcomes spanning environmental, economic, and social dimensions, 2) systematically summarize the quantitative methods used to analyze urban morphology-sustainability relationships, 3) identify existing research trends, gaps, and future research directions for sustainable urban morphology studies. Based on the 89 systematically searched and synthesized articles, we identified 365 unique metrics of urban morphology with a wide variability of names, operational definitions, and data used. We provided a list of these metrics classified into six aspects (i.e., urban tissue configuration, street network, building-plot characteristics, land use, natural features and greenspace, and urban growth) and their sub-categories, highlighting the most used metrics. Even though urban morphology is inherently a spatial concept, considerations of spatial models in understanding urban morphology-sustainability relationships were limited. Synthesizing nine groups of sustainable outcomes further informed that future studies should focus more on the natural features and ecosystem health of cities. This review recommended adopting a consistent classification scheme in measuring, quantifying, and assessing urban forms in relation to sustainable outcomes to facilitate interdisciplinary research as an important step to finding solutions for achieving environmental, social, and economic sustainable outcomes worldwide.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture strives to ensure future food and energy supply while safeguarding natural resources. The interpretation of sustainability varies by context and country, yielding distinct indicators. Researchers have studied sustainable agriculture for the past 25 years and have developed several indicators. Renewable energy holds a vital role in sustainable agriculture, aiding energy needs and mitigating environmental harm tied to agriculture. It curbs fossil fuel dependency and harnesses agricultural waste for energy. However, a consistent update of renewable energy indicators for agricultural sustainability is needed. Employing SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodologies within the PRISMA protocol, this study extracts 84 indicators from 420 papers via SCOPUS. These indicators span social, environmental, economic, institutional, and technical dimensions. The study refines these indicators based on significance and influence, offering an enriched perspective. Furthermore, the analysis categorizes papers by publication year, continent, and topic, providing insights for stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers. By ensuring periodic indicator updates, this research promotes sustainable agriculture, informs priority areas, and guides strategic decisions. This contributes to global resilience and food security aspirations in a changing world. The future of renewable energy and sustainable agriculture will involve cutting-edge technologies, refined policy frameworks, and inclusive cross-sector collaboration to address pressing global challenges and create a greener, more resilient world.

AB  - Linear Transport Infrastructure (LTI) often has important impacts on wildlife and landscape processes. Two reviews provided early insight and nuance into LTI impacts on birdlife but were published when road ecology experiments were still being developed. Four factors were identified to impact birds near roads: habitat quality, species-specific traits, traffic noise, and infrastructure. Although early work identified traffic noise as the main selective force, recent studies lend more support to habitat quality and infrastructure. However, this literature was deemed to possess low inferential strength given inconsistent data collection, inadequate management of confounding variables, limited inclusion of vehicle-free environments, short-term experimental timeframes, and use of methodologies susceptible to bias. A new experimental framework for better evaluation of the impact of roads on birdlife is proposed. This would facilitate the construction of species and/or community profiles useful in the design, construction, and management of transport networks.

In recent years many factors have emerged that have created economic, climate and social crises - or have revived strategies to combat their effects. Urban horticulture has come to stay as an alternative strategy for upgrading urban life and developing sustainability. As it turns out, it can face problems such as urbanization, social exclusion, lack of free space, climate crisis, poverty, lack of environmental education and social solidarity, food degradation, etc. The descriptive and systematic review of the literature was chosen as a research process to fully clarify the role of urban horticulture in the sustainable food security of the cities belonging to the Balkan region. In the systematic review case, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria were included. The descriptive review was based on the grey literature, bibliographic lists of books, previous research projects, bibliography of relevant articles, etc. The results of these studies are obtained through a critical evaluation of the literature review, emphasising the need to capture the current situation and in the search for sustainable urban solutions to address the problems at the lowest cost. Although the survey showed significant differences in the result rates, there seems to be a correlation between urbanization and rates of research on urban farming in conjunction with food security. Also, other parameters such as poverty, the health crisis, social inequalities, etc., that affect the data on urban cultivation in the countries of interest should be further investigated.

AB  - As the mining industry expands, a comprehensive understanding of its socioeconomic risks and benefits is urgently needed. This paper systematically reviews 71 studies (1996-2021) that utilized spatially integrated approaches to evaluate socioeconomic mining impacts. The number of studies that utilize geographic information systems and remote sensing to study mining impacts increased from 2014 onwards. A framework was used to classify the mining impacts studied in the literature and all eight framework categories - Environment, Land, People, Community, Culture, Livelihoods, Infrastructure and Housing - were captured by the literature though Culture was least studied. Coal mining, active mining phase, Landsat data and classic remote sensing algorithms were most highlighted. Future research should focus on advancing geospatial technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to better capture intangible socioeconomic impacts, under-researched minerals and long-term mine lifecycle components. Spatially referenced social data can improve stakeholder involvement and support spatially explicit planning to ensure sustainability.

AB  - Human interactions with surface water systems, through land-use dynamics, can influence the transmission of infectious water-related diseases. As a result, the aim of our study was to explore and examine the state of scientific evidence on the influences of these interactions on water-related infectious disease outcomes from a global perspective. A systematic review was conducted, using 54 peer-reviewed research articles published between 1995 and August 2019. The study revealed that there has been an increase in the number of publications since 2009; however, few of these publications (n = 6) made explicit linkages to the topic. It was found that urban and agricultural land-use changes had relatively high adverse impacts on water quality, due to high concentrations of fecal matter, heavy metals, and nutrients in surface water systems. Water systems were found as the common "vehicle" for infectious disease transmission, which in turn had linkages to sanitation and hygiene conditions. The study found explicit linkages between human-surface water interaction patterns and the transmission of water-based disease. However, weak and complex linkages were found between land-use change and the transmission of water-borne disease, due to multiple pathways and the dynamics of the other determinants of the disease. Therefore, further research studies, using interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to investigate and enhance a deeper understanding of these complexities and linkages among land use, surface water quality, and water-related infectious diseases, is crucial in developing integrated measures for sustainable water quality monitoring and diseases prevention.

AB  - Context Cities have elevated temperatures compared to rural areas, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island''. Higher temperatures increase the risk of heat-related mortality, which will be exacerbated by climate change.
   Objectives To examine the impact of climate change and urban growth on future urban temperatures and the potential for increased heat stress on urban residents.
   Methods We conducted a systematic review of scientific articles from Jan 2000 to May 2016.
   Results The majority (n = 49, = 86%) of studies examined climate change and the urban heat island in isolation, with few (8) considering their combined effect. Urban growth was found to have a large impact on local temperatures, in some cases by up to 5 degrees C in North-east USA. In some locations climate change increased the heat island, such as Chicago and Beijing, and in others decreased it, such as Paris and Brussels. When the relative impact of both factors was considered, the temperature increase associated with the urban heat island was always higher. Few studies (9) considered heat stress and its consequences for urban populations. Important contributors to urban temperatures, such as variation in urban density and anthropogenic heat release, were often excluded from studies.
   Conclusions We identify a need for an increased research focus on (1) urban growth impact on the urban heat island in climate change studies; (2) heat stress; and, (3) variation in urban density and its impacts on anthropogenic heat. Focussing on only one factor, climate change or urban growth, risks underestimating future urban temperatures and hampering adaptation.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has the potential to help farmers implement both adaptation and mitigation practices. The mitigation aspect of CSA is often not considered by farmers due to a high discount rate and, as such, adaptation is usually the priority concern. This review article offers perspective on this issue and highlights two key gaps in the literature: (i) understanding of factors related to the uptake of adaptation practices with co-benefits for mitigation and, (ii) the role of social networks to better enable rapid, widespread implementation of CSA, the latter being critical to bringing CSA to scale. The systematic review treated literature on synergies between adaptation, mitigation and social networks in the rural sector, as well as case studies illustrating the importance of social networks in climate change interventions when addressing synergies in adaptation and mitigation. We find that additional research is required that explicitly focuses on how social networks and social capital may be harnessed to hasten the adoption and uptake of highly synergistic CSA practices. This will facilitate both adaptation in the near term and contribute to mitigation at scale, allowing small-scale farmers to both benefit from and contribute to a 1.5 degrees C future.

AB  - Achieving sustainable urban development requires a reorientation in the planning, management, and design of cities based on the use of cross-cutting solutions that can systematically address urban problems. The implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) such as green walls in cities contributes to reducing the effects of a systemic issue: climate change. This field of research is constantly evolving, and there is a growing need for systematic analysis to understand the current scenario, identify gaps, and accelerate new lines of research. This review aims to demonstrate the impact of green walls on urban comfort by providing a systematic review of the state of the art in the field of temperature reduction and acoustic absorption, identifying the factors that influence urban comfort through the use of vegetation, and highlighting research gaps that can be further explored. The most relevant results have shown that the temperature reduction is mainly influenced by the shading capacity of the selected vegetation type, the evapotranspiration process of the plants, and the presence of substrate. Also, the acoustic absorption capacity is influenced to a greater extent by the system's configuration, the substrate's characteristics, and the vegetation's density. In both cases, the environmental conditions in which they are found can vary the impact to a greater or lesser extent. The results of this research are relevant for the implementation of green walls as a climate change mitigation tool in cities and the development of new research approaches.

AB  - This paper explores the evidence for environmental influences on older adult health and activity participation, identifies current knowledge gaps and limitations within this literature, and offers recommendations for future research via a systematic appraisal of 83 quantitative and qualitative studies. A Cochrane-type review procedure was followed, which incorporated structured database searches, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality appraisal of included studies, and peer review. The review findings identify support for both personal and environmental influences on health and activity participation in later life. Reported personal influences include ethnicity and cultural norms, energy and motivation, sex, age, education, genetic heritage, self-efficacy, and personal financial circumstances. Reported environmental influences on activity participation include climate, level of pollution, street lighting, traffic conditions, accessibility and appropriateness of services and facilities, socio-economic conditions, aesthetics, pedestrian infrastructure, community life, exposure to antisocial behaviour, social network participation, environmental degradation, level of urbanism, exposure to natural settings, familiarity with local environment and others. Recommendations for future research include the need for innovative research methods; involvement of older adults as research collaborators; investigation of wider aspects of the active ageing concept; in-depth assessment of the environmental characteristics of areas; investigation of the pathways leading from environment to health and activity participation; and more theoretically informed research or increased contribution of research to theory development.

AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the search for solutions to social problems associated with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Main actors are turning to Digital Social Innovations (DSIs), defined as collaborative innovations where enterprises, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to promote solutions at scale and speed, connecting innovation, the social world and digital ecosystems to reach the 2030 Agenda. This study aims to identify how digital transformations and social innovations solve social problems and address SDGs. We conducted a systematic review based on a sample of 45 peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 to 2022, combining a bibliometric study and a content analysis focusing on opportunities and threats impacting these fields. We observed the spread and increasing use of technologies associated with all 17 SDGs, specially blockchain, IoT, artificial intelligence, and autonomous robots that are increasing their role and presence exponentially, completely changing the current way of doing things, offering a dramatic evolution in many different segments, such as health care, smart cities, agriculture, and the combat against poverty and inequalities. We identified many threats concerning ethics, especially with the increased use of public data, and concerns about the impacts on the labor force and the possible instability and impact it may cause in low skill/low pay jobs. We expect that our findings advance the concept of digital social innovations and the benefits of its adoption to promote social advancements.

AB  - FSC is a worldwide recognized forest certification scheme, that aims to promote the environmentally responsible management and conservation of the world's forests. Despite its broad application, there is little evidence of its effect on biodiversity. To address this important knowledge gap, here we conducted a systematic review and a hierarchical meta-analysis of the effects of FSC on biodiversity worldwide. Our review yielded 57 studies spanning 2004-2022. Most studies were in the Americas and Europe (31 % and 28 %, respectively), and largely focused on vascular plants (41 %). Half (51 %) of the studies aimed to determine the effect of FSC certification on biodiversity. There were 15 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, resulting in 231 effect sizes for mammal, bird, and vascular plant abundance and 10 for vascular plant richness. Overall, there is a neutral effect of certification on taxa abundance, with only a positive effect on mammal assemblages. Responses varied considerably between mammals' traits. Threatened species, individuals with reduced body weight, and omniv-orous species benefit from management under the FSC scheme. Vascular plant richness exhibited significantly higher values in FSC-certified areas. Moreover, the abundance of vascular plants also differs among traits, with shrubs and adult trees benefiting from FSC certification. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in biodiversity responses to FSC, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. The overall neutral effect and the divergent responses of taxa and species traits suggest that taxa/species-specific manage-ment and improvement of FSC criteria are required.

AB  - Context Globally, forest landscapes are rapidly transforming, with the role of institutions as mediators in their use and management constantly appearing in the literature. However, global comparative reviews to enhance comprehension of how forest management institutions (FMIs) are conceptualized, and the varying determinants of compliance, are lacking. And so too, is there knowledge fragmentation on the methodological approaches which have and should be prioritized in the new research agenda on FMIs.Objectives We review the regional variations in the conceptualization of FMIs, analyze the determinants of compliance with FMIs, and assess the methodological gaps applied in the study of FMIs.Methods A systematic review of 197 empirically conducted studies (491 cases) on FMIs was performed, including a directed content analysis.Results First, FMIs literature is growing; multi-case and multi-country studies characterize Europe/North America, Africa and Latin America, over Asia. Second, the structure-process conceptualization of FMIs predominates in Asia and Africa. Third, global south regions report high cases of compliance with informal FMIs, while non-compliance was registered for Europe/North America in the formal domain. Finally, mixed-methods approaches have been least employed in the studies so far; while the use of only qualitative methods increased over time, the adoption of only quantitative approaches witnessed a decrease.Conclusion Future research should empirically ground informality in the institutional set-up of Australia while also valorizing mixed-methods research globally. Crucially, future research should consider multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to explore the actor and power dimensions of forest management institutions.

AB  - In the USA, there are an estimated 9.6 million families, individuals, trusts, estates, and family partnerships, collectively referred to as family forest owners, who control 110 million ha of forestland or 39% of the country's forests. Between 2000 and 2019, 640 peer-reviewed articles were published that focused on family forest owners in the USA. These articles were published across 95 sources with the Journal of Forestry, Forest Policy and Economics, Small-scale Forestry, and Journal of Extension being the most common. Most articles focused on geographic or participatory subsets of family forest owners with many doing cross-subset comparisons, such as between program participants and non-participants. Quantitative methods, and in particular surveys, were the most common data collection techniques, but qualitative, simulation, and synthesis approaches were also applied. Theoretical frameworks were scant across most studies with behavioral change models being the most common frameworks among those studies that did explicitly include one. Forest management and policies and programs were the most common topics, but the relative frequency of topics changed over time with topics such as forest management decreasing and legacy increasing. Much has been learned about family forest owners, but there is still much that is unknown. Harmonization across studies could help to increase comparisons and allow for drawing of broader conclusions. Continuing to borrow ideas from other fields and stronger incorporation of theoretical frameworks could also help further this scientific field, but it is also important that attention is paid to the implications of the research to ensure it has the greatest possible impact on the threats and challenges facing family forests.

AB  - Small and fragmented arable land is a key challenge for small-scale agricultural countries, resulting in low labor productivity, ecological damage, and inefficient land use. To cope with this challenge, the farmland transfer (FLT) policy is implemented to establish modern agriculture based on specialization and scale enlargement. Despite the rising body of literature, an overview of the effect of this policy is lacked. This paper aimed to examine the multi-dimensional effects of FLT in China. A systematic search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases revealed 26 full-text peer-reviewed articles. We found that FLT had both positive and negative effects, and its effects were mainly mediated by intermediary factors. Non-contingent FLT and post-FLT actions were responsible for the adverse effects of FLT. In the literature, the influence of FLT on the environment is the most concerning issue. The results also show that the existing evidence on the effect of FLT is insufficient; therefore, this paper proposes to further exploration of the multi-dimensional effects of FLT, institutional feedback, and trade-offs. While FLT offers the potential to address socio-economic and environmental challenges, this study suggests that an institutional framework that takes into account spatial and temporal aspects, land-use, market systems, and household conditions is needed to promote favorable development, and mitigate potential land market problems and ensure sustainable development. Despite significant limitations remain, the literature on the socio-economic and environmental effects of FLT is increasing.

AB  - This paper seeks to reflect on recent developments in higher education for planning sustainable cities and to draw out the insights from relevant literature emerging from the underexplored interface of the geographies of higher education and policy mobilities. It emerges from an informal review of our own institution's marketing, coordination and monitoring of sustainable cities-relevant programmes and a systematic review of similar programmes offered globally. This we present as a critical provocation responding to a key pedagogical challenge of sustainable cities education, that of promoting mobile knowledge and/or situated learning. We conclude by offering three possibilities for how higher education programme developers might embrace and operationalise this creative tension.

AB  - Aquatic animal diseases are one of the major limiting factors in aquaculture development, with disease emergence forecast to increase with global change. However, in order to treat increasing diseases in a context of global emergence of antimicrobial resistance and strengthening regulations on antimicrobial use, sustainable alternatives are urgently needed. The use of plant supplements to increase fish immunity and disease resistance has gained much popularity within the last decades. The use of functional supplements, such as plants, can also improve growth and feed assimilation, contributing to a better optimization of aquaculture resources (e.g. fish meal inclusion). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to identify the research gaps in the use of plant-enriched diets in fish aquaculture and estimate, for the first time, the overall efficacy of plant-enriched diets on fish growth, immunity and disease resistance as well as the effect of intrinsic parameters (fish trophic level, type of plant material, dosage, treatment duration and pathogen species) on the treatment efficacy. We found that plant-enriched diets significantly enhanced growth, immunity and disease survival of treated fish, regardless of the fish trophic level, treatment duration and type of material used. We also show that plant supplements are a versatile alternative that can benefit different aquaculture sectors (from small-scale fish farmers to intensive productions). Finally, we observed that studies need to improve the information reported about the plant material used (e.g. origin, identification, chemical composition), in order to allow the comparison of different experiments and improve their repeatability.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) frameworks augmented multi-dimensional research, including definitions, principles, indicators, history, limitations, enablers, and allied issues. Rethinking the designing strategies requires the exploration of CE associates and their functioning as companions for amplification through multiple suggestions, highlighting the interactions with the overall CE system towards sustainability. This paper focuses on how CE literature concentrates on premeditated areas and solution approaches. A lack of deterministic manifestations critically limits the interpretation and application of CE concepts. The paper contributes to the CE theoretical and practical understanding by for the first time outlining the CE associates, their connotation, progression, positioning in architecture, and their current state. These associates support individualization of a CE concept. The coherently applied methodology attempts to reduce the knowledge gap by following a systematic quantitative literature review process to screen 76 articles and 122 CE definitions, referencing one decade of literature. Application of comprehensive morphological mining facilitated the extraction of CE associates and later analysis. On application of Bibliometric Analysis, Text Analysis, Semantic Analysis, and Relation Mapping to the literature, 49 associates emerged. They were further validated by application of Content Analysis and Weighted Average Priority Ranking on extracted article content and definitions for deriving the most prominent associates. Subsequently, Association Rules Data Mining and K-Means Clustering were deployed in exploring the relations, ranking, and significance of CE associates. The findings consistently state that business actions (virtualize, exchange); sustainability pillars (society); and R strategies (refuse, refill, and repurpose) are unexplored CE associates, whereas Business, Economics, Environment, Measurement, Product, Industry, Resource, System, Waste, and Recycle are the most explored associates of the CE ecosystem.

AB  - Climate change, manifest via rising temperatures, extreme drought, and associated anthropogenic activities, has a negative impact on the health and development of tropical dryland forests. Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997-2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests.

AB  - Bottom trawl fisheries are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seabed habitats. Development of fisheries-, conservation- and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the selection of indicators of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. Many indicators have been proposed, but no rigorous test of a range of candidate indicators against nine commonly agreed criteria (concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historical data, sensitivity, responsiveness, specificity) has been performed.
   Here, we collated data from 41 studies that compared the benthic biota in trawled areas with those in control locations (that were either not trawled or trawled infrequently), examining seven potential indicators (numbers and biomass for individual taxa and whole communities, evenness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and species richness) to assess their performance against the set of nine criteria.
   The effects of trawling were stronger on whole-community numbers and biomass than for individual taxa. Species richness was also negatively affected by trawling but other measures of diversity were not. Community numbers and biomass met all criteria, taxa numbers and biomass and species richness satisfied most criteria, but evenness and Shannon-Wiener diversity did not respond to trawling and only met few criteria, and hence are not suitable state indicators of the effect of bottom trawling.
   Synthesis and applications. An evaluation of each candidate indicator against a commonly agreed suite of desirable properties coupled with the outputs of our meta-analysis showed that whole-community numbers of individuals and biomass are the most suitable indicators of bottom trawling impacts as they performed well on all criteria. Strengths of these indicators are that they respond strongly to trawling, relate directly to ecosystem functioning and are straightforward to measure. Evenness and Shannon-Wiener diversity are not responsive to trawling and unsuitable for the monitoring and assessment of bottom trawl impacts.

AB  - Co-occurrence of environmental stressors is ubiquitous in ecosystems, but cumulative effects are difficult to predict for effective indicator development. Individual stressors can amplify (synergies) or lessen (antagonisms) each other's impacts or have fully independent effects (additive). Here we use the Laurentian Great Lakes, where a multitude of stressors have been studied for decades, as a case study for considering insights from both a systematic literature review and an expert elicitation (or structured expert judgment) to identify stressor interactions. In our literature search for pairs of stressors and interaction-related keywords, relatively few studies (9%, or 6/65) supported additive interactions with independent stressor effects. Instead, both antagonisms (42%, or 27/65) and synergies (49%, or 32/65) were common. We found substantial evidence for interactions of invasive dreissenid mussels with nutrient loading and between pairs of invasive species (predominantly dreissenids x round goby), yet both sets of records included mixtures of synergies and antagonisms. Complete quantification of individual and joint effects of stressors was rare, but effect sizes for dreissenid mussels x nutrient loading supported an antagonism. Our expert elicitation included discussion in focus groups and a follow-up survey. This process highlighted the potential for synergies of nutrient loading with dreissenid mussels and climate change as seen from the literature review. The elicitation also identified additional potential interactions less explored in the literature, particularly synergies of nutrient loading with hypoxia and wetland loss. To stimulate future research, we built a conceptual model describing interactions among dreissenid mussels, climate change, and nutrient loading. Our case study illustrates the value of considering results from both elicitations and systematic reviews to overcome data limitations. The simultaneous occurrence of synergies and antagonisms in a single ecosystem underscores the challenge of predicting the cumulative effects of stressors to guide indicator development and other management and restoration decisions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to review the available literature and define clinical practice guidelines for the use of agents for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal mucositis.
   A systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO). The body of evidence for each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was assigned an evidence level. Based on the evidence level, one of the following three guideline determinations was possible: recommendation, suggestion, and no guideline possible.
   A total of 251 clinical studies across 29 interventions were examined. Panel members were able to make one new evidence-based negative recommendation; two new evidence-based suggestions, and one evidence-based change from previous guidelines. Firstly, the panel recommends against the use of misoprostol suppositories for the prevention of acute radiation-induced proctitis. Secondly, the panel suggests probiotic treatment containing Lactobacillus spp., may be beneficial for prevention of chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced diarrhea in patients with malignancies of the pelvic region. Thirdly, the panel suggests the use of hyperbaric oxygen as an effective means in treating radiation-induced proctitis. Finally, new evidence has emerged which is in conflict with our previous guideline surrounding the use of systemic glutamine, meaning that the panel is unable to form a guideline. No guideline was possible for any other agent, due to inadequate and/or conflicting evidence.
   This updated review of the literature has allowed new recommendations and suggestions for clinical practice to be reached. This highlights the importance of regular updates.

AB  - Background: Silviculture and land-use change has reduced the amount of natural forest worldwide and left what remains confined to isolated fragments or stands. To understand processes governing species occurrence in such stands, much attention has been given to stand-level factors such as size, structure, and deadwood amount. However, the surrounding matrix will directly impact species dispersal and persistence, and the link between the surrounding landscape configuration, composition and history, and stand-level species occurrence has received insufficient attention. Thus, to facilitate optimisation of forest management and species conservation, we propose a review addressing 'To what extent does surrounding landscape explain stand-level occurrence of conservation-relevant species in fragmented boreal and hemi-boreal forest?'.
   Methods: The proposed systematic review will identify and synthesise relevant articles following the CEE guidelines for evidence synthesis and the ROSES standards. A search for peer-reviewed and grey literature will be conducted using four databases, two online search engines, and 36 specialist websites. Identified articles will be screened for eligibility in a two-step process; first on title and abstract, and second on the full text. Screening will be based on predefined eligibility criteria related to a PECO-model; population being boreal and hemi-boreal forest, exposure being fragmentation, comparator being landscapes with alternative composition, configuration, or history, and outcome being occurrence (i.e., presence and/or abundance) of conservation-relevant species. All articles that pass the full-text screening will go through study validity assessment and data extraction, and be part of a narrative review. If enough studies prove comparable, quantitative meta-analyses will also be performed. The objective of the narrative review and the meta-analyses will be to address the primary question as well as six secondary questions, and to identify important knowledge gaps.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is highly dependent on dynamic river systems at all life stages. However, anthropogenic pressures have modified natural river landscapes, reducing their extent and causing severe limitations to the natural recruitment of riparian species. In particular, the recruitment of Salix species (willows) is highly dependent on fluvial processes. A comprehensive understanding of the drivers of Salix recruitment is crucial to effectively restore and conserve riparian biodiversity. To date however, there has been no systematic review of the drivers of Salix recruitment in riparian ecosystems. We provide a synthesis of Salix recruitment requirements from the scientific literature throughout the world. Our results show that the proportion of species studied compared to existing species is low worldwide, revealing a need for more research on Salix recruitment. We identified 19 abiotic factors concerning Salix recruitment, which we classified into four groups. The most studied abiotic factors are those related to soil (35%) and hydrology (25%). Within those categories, soil moisture and flow regime are the most frequently studied, while interstitial soil temperature, precipitation, geomorphologic dynamism, and atmospheric CO2 content are among the least studied factors. We identified 6 types of environmental pressures. Flow regulation followed by invasive vegetation competition are the most studied pressures, while the effects of climate change and extreme climatic events on willow recruitment have received little attention. Additionally, there has been little consideration of the interactions of multiple anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, we recommend comparative studies and experiments including several species to fill this knowledge gap. Our synthesis of the factors that influence Salix recruitment, such as optimal temperature ranges and elevations, can be incorporated into management practices to promote successful native riparian tree regeneration. Further research on how both abiotic factors and anthropogenic pressures affect Salix regeneration would greatly contribute to conservation of fluvial landscapes, and increase the success of restoration initiatives.

AB  - Due to its influence on multiple soil processes, water intervenes in biogeochemical cycles at multiple spatial scales with contrasting effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. On all scales, water availability influences biological processes, such as plant growth and (micro-)biological activity, leading to organic matter input, its decomposition and stabilisation. On the other hand, SOC influences soil hydrology via its impact on soil wettability and its structural organisation. Our objectives were to review the mechanisms involved in the complex relationship between water and SOC at different scales and to discuss levers of action to improve its modelling and management. We carried out a systematic review and synthesised the information of 987 articles dealing with SOC sequestration and soil water.At the landscape scale, precipitation levels influence vegetation type and biomass production as well as horizontal and vertical transport, determining SOC stocks and their spatial distribution. At the profile scale, SOC and water both control biological processes including those involved in soil aggregate formation, and organi-sation of soil porosity. Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilisation processes occur at the microscale, where water movement facilitates the co-occurrence of SOM and microorganisms.All these multiscale processes may change the nature and distribution of SOM, leading to promotion or in-hibition not only of biogeochemical cycling but also of the water cycle. Taking into account these mutual feedback mechanisms in mechanistic models requires their representation at multiple scales through developing modelling parameters in particular for microbial processes occurring in the pore space. This could greatly reduce modelling uncertainty and improve our understanding of global carbon cycling.Levers of action to improve soil water status and consequently SOC accrual include irrigation, and use of organic amendments. Sustainable agricultural practices should focus on (1) optimising the management of water resources and (2) choosing crop species adapted to various water levels to maintain and foster SOC sequestration, to adapt to climate change and in particular extreme events, such as drought and flooding.

AB  - Introduction: Countries have set as a central policy to achieve universal health coverage by 2030. Resource constraint and the variety of ways to fulfill the purposes of the universal health coverage, however, have led policymakers to face ethical challenges. An elaboration of ethical frameworks can facilitate the right move in this direction.
   Aim: This study examines the ethical frameworks used by countries and postulated by studies for policy-making on universal health coverage.
   Materials and Methods: This systematic review built on the PRISMA guidelines to search the Scopus and PubMed databases for papers published from January 2010 to March 2018. Studies will be considered for inclusion that have focused on the dimensions of policy-making ethics on universal health coverage and referring to the role of ethics in policy-making on health universal coverage. State and organisational reports, book's chapters, proceedings and editorials were not included. The data were analysed using the thematic analysis method and categorised into two groups according to the data extraction forms. The first was related to articles that were the result of a research study and recommendations from international organisations; the second concerned with articles that reflected the experiences of different countries. The extracted data of both groups were classified into three themes, including the role of ethics in universal health, ethical principles, and ethical criteria.
   Results: Out of the 685 articles found in the initial search, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate that ethics acts as the driving force, guidance for decision-making, provider of public acceptance, and a guarantee for justice administration. The ethical framework contains principles of fairness, justice, equality, maximisation of benefits, solidarity, sustainability, good governance, human rights, financial risk protection measures, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Most studies have emphasised the principles of human rights, solidarity, justice and fairness, cost-effectiveness, and financial risk conservation in the policy-making of health universal coverage. Varying cultural and social conditions, the political orientation of countries, and local values underlie the difference in the contents of the moral framework.
   Conclusion: In their attempts to realise universal health coverage, countries must undertake a selection of principles and criteria for their ethical framework through a research process. Given the emergence of the scientific field of ethics for health policy-making, researchers can review the ethical principles and criteria identified in this study in other areas of health policy-making and determine the generalisability of these principles.

AB  - Smart cities are one of the consequences of digital transformation, and there have been many attempts to assess the smartness of cities with various frameworks. Among these frameworks, smart city maturity models (SCMMs) evaluate the existing conditions of cities and provide guidelines for progressing through the subsequent stages of maturity. However, most maturity models follow the instructions of the first model, published by the International Data Corporation, and there are many similarities across the models. These maturity models have advantages and disadvantages, while previous studies have not addressed the differences. Therefore, this article fills this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing the existing SCMMs. The findings suggest that some trending topics, such as resiliency concerning global pandemics and cultural aspects are neglected in SCMMs. Moreover, the validation techniques of the models are not rational. Finally, given the theoretical nature of most models, they cannot be applied to multiple regions.

AB  - Mangrove is a valuable ecological resource. Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in providing wood resources, habitat for various species, accumulation sites for sediments, carbon, and nutrient, providing protection from erosion, acting as a buffer zone, and stabilizing coastlines and riverbanks. This has resulted in various levels of modification in mangrove land use to meet human needs. Various research and articles have been conducted around the world on the land use changes in tropical mangrove swamps with the use of remote sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The objective of this study is to review the effectiveness of remote sensing technology and GIS in determining land use change in mangrove forest areas in Malasyia. This study summarizes the mangrove study results by using GIS according to its specifications in Malaysia from year 2001 to 2021. The systematic review is a method that analyzes the results of the process and sources from Google Scholar (n=125), Scopus (n=10), and Web of Science (WoS) (n=9). The findings show that remote sensing and GIS applications have been widely used in the study of mangrove forests in recent years and contribute to the monitoring of land use changes in the mangrove forest area. The findings also reveal parameters for land use and vegetation indices that have been used in the current issue of mangrove land use change in tropical areas. This study also supports the 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) which focuses on the conservation and protection of oceans and coastal areas in a sustainable manner and recognizes the value of mangroves in the community.

AB  - Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual-(9), population-(6), community-(7), ecosystem-(7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species-or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.

AB  - Background and Objectives Much of the research surrounding firefighter health has concerned the hazards intuitively associated with the occupation, such as physical, thermal, and chemical risks. However, an additional aspect of their work environment, psychosocial stressors, has begun to attract a growing level of attention. Work-related psychosocial stress may best be described as mental and emotional strain caused by a combination of workplace events and characteristics, and the objective of our review was to identify the health outcomes associated with these stressors in firefighters.
   Methods A systematic review was performed of studies reporting on the psychosocial stressors and the associated health outcomes experienced by firefighters. Data sources included the MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and CINAHL databases.
   Results Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Upon analysis, we found that firefighters experienced a range of psychosocial stressors (including interpersonal conflict and concerns over organizational fairness) and observed that these stressors were associated with a number of health-related outcomes that could be arranged into six areas: depression-suicidality, non-depressive mental health problems, burnout, alcohol use disorders, sleep quality, and physiological parameters and somatic disorders.
   Conclusion Our findings strongly suggest that work-related psychosocial stressors can affect the health and well-being of those in the fire service, and highlight that interventions meant to address these psychosocial risk factors should focus upon promoting self-esteem, enhancing self-efficacy, and strengthening social support.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are the non-material benefits obtained from ecosystems that contribute to human well-being. They are often under-represented in ecosystem services assessments due to difficulties identifying and valuing intangible attributes. This risks a lack of understanding and consideration of CES by decision-makers. A systematic review was done on coastal and marine CES to identify: geographic distribution of research; effective methods for assessing CES; specific habitats/ecosystems that supply CES; subcategories most frequently addressed; and knowledge gaps. Results revealed limited information exists about coastal and marine CES. There is a disparity in the global distribution of studies with little knowledge about CES in developing countries, as well as a disparity within developed countries; with most research undertaken in Europe and North America. There is a dearth of information on CES derived from specific coastal and marine habitats/ecosystems, reflecting a poor understanding of socio-ecological relationships and the different values people assign to these areas. There is a need to develop indicators with the capacity to measure and track changes in CES over time. Participatory approaches using qualitative methods were most effective in identifying CES; however, these lacked a deliberative element that would provide a comprehensive assessment of shared values in public areas. Overall, publications typically theorised about the usefulness of data on CES to inform and support decision makers, and more research is required on how qualitative data on CES can be represented for practical use by coastal and marine resource managers, and the value of these in the real world.

AB  - We aimed to explore associations between the accessibility of fast-food restaurants (FFRs) and weight-related outcomes in children and adolescents through a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies. We searched three databases for studies published before October 21, 2022. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Meta-analysis was performed, and the leave-one-out method was used for sensitivity analysis. A total of 60 studies were included. According to our analysis, FFRs within a smaller buffer radius from residences or that provide unhealthy foods may have a more significant influence on children's and adolescents' weight. Children of younger ages and girls may have a higher possibility of being overweight due to FFRs. Though we could hardly avoid bias, the estimates in low-and middle-income countries (only six studies) are much higher than those in high-income countries (54 studies). More research analyses based on microscope data and individual economic levels are needed. This study yields quantitative results, provides policymakers and urban planners with a theoretical support for building resilient and sustainable human settlements, and promotes the translation of research findings from public health to environmental planning.

AB  - Background "Active aging" is an inclusive term and has been defined from a variety of aspects in different domains throughout the literature. The aim of this review was to identify those aspects that play significant roles in building this concept using an ecological approach. Methods In this study, seven online databases, including JSTOR, Pub-Med, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest, EBSCO, and Scopus, were searched from 2002 to 2018 for both qualitative and quantitative articles published in English. Two reviewers independently found the related articles using the search terms "active aging" and "built environment" and included both "ageing" and "aging". Results Of 1500 records which passed the screening stage, 92 were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 15 subthemes were derived: (1) personal characteristics, (2) behavioral attitude, (3) land use, (4) access, (5) physical form, (6) cityscape/city image, (7) public open spaces, (8) housing, (9) social environment, (10) cultural Environment, (11) economic environment, (12) good governance, (13) physical health, (14) mental health, and (15) social health. Ecological themes of active aging can be defined as the 5P model: person, processes, place, prime, and policymaking. Conclusions The results of this study can shed light on different aspects of active aging. Also, the results emphasized the significance of the multidimensional nature of active aging, micro (person), meso (process), and macro systems (place and policymaking), based on health (prime) environments. Moreover, the results were based on the relationships between the person and the environment at the individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels, which can be used to conduct future studies and develop policies on aging populations.

AB  - Purpose An adequate matching between the nomenclature of elementary flows in life cycle inventory (LCI) databases and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods is key for ensuring the proper application of life cycle assessment (LCA). However, the nomenclature of elementary flows lacks harmonization among the LCA community. This paper aims at defining mapping rules and discussing main challenges related to the process of systematically mapping LCI nomenclatures to LCIA methods and models addressing biodiversity impacts. Methods Eight LCIA methods and models addressing biodiversity loss are analyzed: five comprehensive LCIA methods (i.e., LC-IMPACT, Impact World + , Ecological Scarcity 2013, ReCiPe 2016, and Stepwise), one land use intensity-specific LCIA model; and two approaches adapting the GLOBIO model to LCIA. These models and methods are mapped to two LCI nomenclatures (ecoinvent v3.6 as implemented in Simapro and Environmental Footprint (EF) 3.0). A mapping tool was developed to support the process of (a) mapping elementary flows by name, Chemical Abstract Service number or available synonyms; (b) implementing specific mapping rules regarding compartment/sub-compartment, and substance name; (c) mapping elementary flows to manually defined proxies (e.g., synonyms, spelling corrections and similar substances); and (d) assigning characterization factors (CFs). The process entails analyzing a case study to identify uncharacterized elementary flows. Results and discussion We present a mapping of LCIA methods and models addressing impacts on biodiversity loss with specific LCI nomenclatures. Mapping rules are proposed for elementary flows regarding chemicals, carbon emissions, land use, water use, and particulate matter. Specific aspects to be considered in mapping elementary flows in LCIA and LCI nomenclatures are discussed. Main gaps in LCI nomenclatures are associated to toxicity and climate change impacts. The EF 3.0 was more aligned than ecoinvent 3.6 with the LCIA methods and models regarding elementary flows coverage and regionalization level. Analyzing uncharacterized flows revealed further coverage needs for "Chemical, organic" (between 19 and 20% uncharacterized flows), "Chemical, inorganic" (between 9 and 18% uncharacterized flows) and "Chemical, radioactive" (between 9 and 14% uncharacterized flows). Conclusions This paper contributes to the operationalization of LCIA methods and models addressing biodiversity impacts by proposing a systematic mapping process and rules for a better LCIA-LCI connection. Different development pathways of LCI (e.g., focused on substance name detail) and LCIA (e.g., towards improved regionalization level) have stretched the gap between both nomenclatures. Recommendations are provided identifying further efforts towards the harmonization of the nomenclature of elementary flows in the LCA community.

AB  - A decade of research has produced substantial results but the theorization of memorable tourism experience, often drawing on positive and environmental psychology, remains fuzzy and fragmented. Adopting state-of-the art practices, this study systematically reviews, synthesizes, and integrates the extant body of knowledge across multiple literature streams on memorable tourism experience. Our review indicates that research in this field has a geographical bias, largely neglects negative experiences, and mainly employs quantitative methods. We identify several gaps in the literature and propose the following seven recommendations for future research: (1) caution when using the memorable tourism experience scale; (2) the need for cross-cultural studies; (3) positive and negative dimensions in conceptualizing memorable tourism experience; (4) overcoming the limitations of self-report measures; (5) engaging in mixed methods research; (6) integrating suppliers' perspectives; and (7) combining theories, concepts, and disciplines. This study serves as a foundation for researchers and provides a holistic understanding of memorable tourism experience.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review of biodiversity/ecosystem services scenario exercises from the Asia-Pacific region. From the limited scholarly literature available, 61 scenario exercises were examined to explore their typology and multiple scenario attributes, including geographic distribution, consideration for influential drivers, choices of ecosystem services, number of alternative futures and temporal horizons for scenario deployment. To analyze the nature and tendency of 204 regional scenario narratives, collated from the 61 regional/sub-regional scenario studies, we used the Global Scenario Group (GSG) archetypes to synthesize diverse, contrasting scenario assumptions. A further attempt was made to identify regional focuses in relation to the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) through rigorous, qualitative screening of scenario narratives. Our observation suggests that, so far, spatially explicit, exploratory scenarios dominate regional ecosystem services/biodiversity scenario research, with emphasis on the assessment of likely trades-offs in food-provisioning ecosystem services. The archetype analysis further indicated that the regional/sub-regional scenarios mostly correspond to the market force, policy reform and eco-communalism pathways of the GSG archetypes, while population growth, climate change, agricultural expansion and urbanization remain the dominant regional drivers of change. With respect to integration of SDGs, environmental targets listed under SDGs 11 to 15, in addition to the first three SDGs (i.e. SDGs 1, 2 and 3), remain well-integrated within the regional/sub-regional scenario narratives, albeit with variations across the sub-regions. The review concludes with a number of recommendations for future biodiversity/scenario research in the Asia-Pacific, which should aim to put emphasis on development of short-term, normative, participatory scenarios and incorporation for cultural services, especially those with non-material benefits.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) are indispensable for life. Stakeholders are improvising strategies for a more sustainable provisioning of UES. For this purpose and for identifying orientations towards geospatial data in UES studies, the "bibliometric analysis" technique was deployed. The inclinations facilitate assessments pertaining to spatio-temporal oscillations in the supply-demand equilibrium. The propensities are gaining recognition due to time and cost effectiveness. Besides this, Remote Sensing (RS) in conjunction with Geographic Information System (GIS), enables the conduct of synoptic and robust periodic evaluations. The study analyzes inclinations towards RS in contemporary research (2010-2020) focusing, particularly, on urban ecosystem services. It specifically focuses on methodological frameworks and major sources of remotely sensed data. Therefore, a total of 261 records of research articles were identified and retrieved. Subsequently, 79 articles were selected for further processing and content analysis. It transpired that approximately 30% of the selected publications deployed remotely sensed data for assessment purposes. The majority (96%) of such studies were conducted in economically developed and industrialized countries. However, the researchers from both developed and developing countries prefer open software and free data sources. Besides this, they prefer satellite-based optical sensors over image sensors such as TIR, SAR, or light sensors for acquiring data. The findings formulate that Land Use Land Cover (LULC)-based methodologies and inclinations for assessing regulating services are more frequently pursued. The findings revealed that enhanced research collaborations, access to data, and assessment gadgets are obligatory for capacity building in developing regions. Knowledge sharing and cost-effective access to RS and GIS based platforms are incumbent for ensuring urban environmental sustainability in developing economies.

AB  - Revisional bariatric surgery following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) failure presents a clinical challenge for the bariatric surgeon. Limited evidence exists in selecting the appropriate revisional operation: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB), laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG), or other surgical intervention (OSI), to address weight regain. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the efficacy of existing revisional surgery. A comprehensive search of electronic databases (e.g., Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was completed. All randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. Eleven primary studies (218 patients) were identified and included in the systematic review. Studies were grouped into three main categories: LGB, LRSG, and OSI. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 41.9 kg/m(2) (LGB), 38.5 kg/m(2) (LRSG), and 44.4 kg/m(2) (OSI). After conversion to LGB, BMI decreased to 33.7 and 35.7 kg/m(2) at 12 and 24 months of follow-up, respectively. Excess weight loss (EWL) was 60 and 48 % over the same periods. After LRSG, BMI decreased to 30.4 and 35.3 kg/m(2) with corresponding EWL of 68 and 44 %, at 12 and 24 months, respectively. After OSI, BMI decreased to 27.3 kg/m(2) with an EWL of 75 % at 24-month follow-up but could not be analyzed due to incomplete data collection in primary studies. Both LGB and LRSG achieve effective weight loss following failed LSG. The less technically challenging nature of LRSG may be more widely applicable. Further research is required to elicit sustainability in long-term weight loss benefits.

AB  - With increasing concerns of labor issue risks within supply chains, both academia and practitioners are paying increasingly great attention to how to design and implement effective management approaches to enhance labor sustainability in supply chains. Furthermore, digitalization facilitates and brings both opportunities and challenges to this area. Using the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we conducted a systematic literature review based on 50 selected papers from the Web of Science database. Starting from the supply chain level, this study identifies digital technology (DT)-enabled labor sustainability management practices, barriers to the adoption of DT in labor management practices, and the performance outcomes of such practices. In addition, we put forward solutions to eliminate those identified barriers to facilitate DT adoption in firms' labor sustainability management. Last, future directions and research opportunities for both supply chain management and labor sustainability are summarized.

AB  - The relationship between tourism and changing climate has been discussed and studied for a relatively long time in tourism research. Over the past 15 years, more focused studies have begun to appear, and especially recently, the issue of adaptation has been emphasised as an urgent research need in tourism and climate change studies. This paper is based on a systematic review of the tourism and adaptation literature prior to 2012. It discusses adaptation challenges, the dimensions of vulnerability in a tourism context and the implications of such studies on communities. By dividing the current adaptation studies into business; consumer; destination; and policy- and framework-focused theme areas and traditions, the paper concludes that adaptation studies in tourism have so far had a limited focus on community perceptions, which in general has been an area of major interest in tourism research. More emphasis on community-based research in relation to tourism and climate change allows highly contextual adaptation challenges to be met in a more sustainable way.

AB  - Targeted 'omics' research for seaweeds, utilizing various computational and informatics frameworks, has the potential to rapidly develop our understanding of biological processes at the molecular level and contribute to solutions for the most pressing environmental and social issues of our time. Here, a systematic review into the current status of seaweed omics research was undertaken to evaluate the biological diversity of seaweed species investigated (red, green and brown phyla), the levels to which the work was undertaken (from full genome to transcripts, proteins or metabolites) and the field of research to which it has contributed. We report that from 1994 to 2021 the majority of seaweed omics research has been performed on the red seaweeds (45% of total studies), with more than half of these studies based upon two genera Pyropia and Gracilaria. A smaller number of studies examined brown seaweed (key genera Saccharina and Sargassum) and green seaweed (primarily Ulva). Overall, seaweed omics research is most highly associated with the field of evolution (46% of total studies), followed by the fields of ecology, natural products and their biosynthesis, omics methodology and seaweed-microbe interactions. Synthesis and specific outcomes derived from omics studies in the red seaweeds are provided. Together, these studies have provided a broad-scale interrogation of seaweeds, facilitating our ability to answer fundamental queries and develop applied outcomes. Crucial to the next steps will be establishing analytical tools and databases that can be more broadly utilized by practitioners and researchers across the globe because of their shared interest in the key seaweed genera.

AB  - Urban infrastructure systems responsible for the provision of energy, transportation, shelter, and communication to populations are important determinants of health and health equity. The term "smart city" has been used synonymously with other terms, such as "digital city", "sustainable city", and "information city", even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use "smart cities" as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies

AB  - The recent increase in the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian usage stems mainly from modern technological advancements and the devices ' abilities to accomplish civilian tasks in a quick, safe, and cost-efficient manner. One sector that witnessed tremendous UAV impact is the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Among several AEC applications, UAV technology is currently being implemented for building and bridge inspection, progress monitoring, and urban planning. The following review aims at thoroughly classifying all AEC-related UAV applications within the past decade, extending the understanding of the current state of UAV implementation in the AEC domain, and outlining relevant research trends in this setting. The review follows a systematic literature assessment methodology in which peer-reviewed bibliographical databases were queried, based on specific search keywords, for AEC-related UAV applications. This study also discusses the technological components (flying styles, types of platforms, onboard sensors) to assist in better developing, integrating, and understanding the technology implemented in the AEC industry. Our search query yielded 228 articles, of which 86 met our inclusion criteria and were therefore analyzed. Seven categories of structural and infrastructure inspection, transportation, cultural heritage conservation, city and urban planning, progress monitoring, post-disaster, and construction safety were identified and fully analyzed in this study. The study revealed that UAV integration in the AEC domain might exhibit equal, if not, higher outcomes compared to conventional methods as to time, accuracy, safety, and costs. In terms of technology, the control styles reported were mostly autonomous and manual. Rotary wing vehicles were the predominant type of platforms in the literature. Of the rotary wing type, quadcopters were most commonly employed. Readily available, or "off-the-shelf" video recording cameras and thermal cameras were most frequently mounted on UAVs, followed by LiDAR and laser scanning devices. Other sensors included Radio Frequency Identification and Ultrasonic Beacon System. The outcome of this study would benefit both AEC researchers and professionals to recognize the potentials of UAVs and understand the requirements and challenges for their successful integration.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is leading to widespread losses around the world. While the focus of research over the last decade has largely been on economic or tangible losses, researchers have begun to shift their focus to understanding the non-economic or intangible dimensions of loss more deeply. Loss of life, biodiversity and social cohesion are some of the losses that are beginning to be explored, along with Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) and cultural heritage. These latter two form the basis of this systematic review of 100 studies to take stock of what we know about climate-driven losses to ILK and cultural heritage, how such losses manifest and how they are overcome, revealing gaps in our knowledge and carving a path for future research.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this article is to explore themes and challenges in making supply chains environmentally sustainable.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study began with a systematic review, and content analysis of articles in top-ranking related journals from logistics, transport, sustainability and environmental areas, and ended with research propositions contributing to the further advancement of supply chain management.
   Findings - The findings illustrate the major themes published in 18 journals concentrating on sustainable supply chains with special focus on environmental issues. From the systematic review five major areas of challenges for supply chain management are derived: costs, complexity, operationalisation, mindset and cultural changes, and uncertainties. From all of these areas synthesising discussions are provided and research propositions suggested. It is concluded that there is a great need for models and frameworks that consider the complexity involved, take holistic perspectives, and challenge the basic assumptions underlying most of the research published (i.e. reductionism, positivism and economic growth).
   Research limitations/implications - Sustainability in this article is mainly related to environmental issues. Analysis of complex interactions between environmental, social and economic aspects might provide opportunities for future research.
   Practical implications - The results presented in this paper provide a systematic structure for classifying issues related to logistics sustainability; something which will be beneficial for managers and policy-makers when they approach sustainable supply chain management challenges.
   Originality/value - This paper provides propositions for research based on the emergent outcome of challenges that can guide research, industry and policy-makers in future sustainability efforts.

AB  - Objective: Although the effectiveness of integrated mental health care has been demonstrated, its implementation in real-world settings is highly variable, may not conform to evidence-based practice, and has rarely been evaluated. Quality indicators can guide improvements in integrated care implementation. However, the literature on indicators for this purpose is limited. This article reports findings from a systematic review of existing measures by which to evaluate integrated care models in primary care settings.
   Methods: Bibliographic databases and gray literature sources, including academic conference proceedings, were searched to July 2014. Measures used or proposed to evaluate integrated care implementation or outcomes were extracted and critically appraised. A qualitative synthesis was conducted to generate a panel of unique measures and to group these measures into broad domains and specific dimensions of integrated care program performance.
   Results: From 172 literature sources, 1,255 measures were extracted, which were distilled into 148 unique measures. Existing literature frequently reports integrated care program effectiveness vis-a-vis evidence-based care processes and individual clinical outcomes, as well as efficiency (cost-effectiveness) and client satisfaction. No measures of safety of care and few measures of equitability, accessibility, or timeliness of care were located, despite the known benefits of integrated care in several of these areas.
   Conclusions: To realize the potential for quality measurement to improve integrated care implementation, future measures will need to incorporate domains of quality that are presently unaddressed; microprocesses of care that influence effectiveness, sustainability, and transferability of models of care; and client and health care provider perspectives on meaningful measures of quality.

AB  - This paper sets out to contribute to a critical theory debate through the presentation and use of a framework for the categorisation of literature linked to Product Service System (PSS).
   Moving from the analysis of literature we provide a conceptual structure depicting the current situation of literature dealing with the analysis of economic impact and environmental/social impact of Product Service System. Moreover, we provide a methodological structure, concerning methodologies and research purpose behind papers.
   Literature mainly agrees about PSS benefits, barriers, and partly also on drivers, but from the descriptive and thematic analysis what emerged is a lack of clarity about PSS and its main fields: it started as a topic closely connected with sustainability, but subsequently different fields have developed other terminologies and focuses of research, developing their own theoretical base and frameworks. Therefore, we have found a lack of interconnection among fields and subject areas.
   A critical aspect in current literature is about the analysis/evaluation of Product Service System performance: economic and environmental analyses should be updated with new methodologies and new perspectives (i.e. privileging an ex post perspective rather than an ex ante one). Furthermore, these analyses should be integrated in a unique tool, which would be essential in providing a complete perspective on the PSS phenomenon and its effects.
   Finally, we propose and discuss main future research directions, connected, to the main current research streams: sustainability, Product Service System business models and collaborative consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In the past decade, various reviews described the relationship between the physical environment and different physical activity (PA) domains. Yet, the majority of the current review evidence relies on North American/Australian studies, while only a small proportion of findings refer to European studies. Given some clear environmental differences across continents, this raises questions about the applicability of those results in European settings. This systematic review aimed at summarizing Europe-specific evidence on the relationship between the physical environment and different PA domains in adults.
   Methods: Seventy eligible papers were identified through systematic searches across six electronic databases. Included papers were observational studies assessing the relationship between several aspects of the physical environment and PA in European adults (18-65y). Summary scores were calculated to express the strength of the relationship between each environmental factor and different PA domains.
   Results: Convincing evidence on positive relationships with several PA domains was found for following environmental factors: walkability, access to shops/services/work and the composite factor environmental quality. Convincing evidence considering urbanization degree showed contradictory results, dependent on the observed PA domain. Transportation PA was more frequently related to the physical environment than recreational PA. Possible evidence for a positive relationship with transportation PA emerged for walking/cycling facilities, while a negative relationship was found for hilliness. Some environmental factors, such as access to recreational facilities, aesthetics, traffic-and crime-related safety were unrelated to different PA domains in Europe.
   Conclusions: Generally, findings from this review of European studies are in accordance with results from North American/Australian reviews and may contribute to a generalization of the relationship between the physical environment and PA. Nevertheless, the lack of associations found regarding access to recreational facilities, aesthetics and different forms of safety are likely to be Europe-specific findings and need to be considered when appropriate interventions are developed. More research assessing domain-specific relationships with several understudied environmental attributes (e. g., residential density) is needed.

AB  - We need a proper mechanism to manage issues related to our environment, economy, and society to proceed toward sustainability. Many researchers have worked for sustainable development goals using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to develop an efficient mechanism to facilitate a circular economy and link up the needs of the present generation without disconcerting the capability of coming generations. This study offers a comprehensive review of AI and sustainability and suggested future research scope. The review has focused on different use cases in industries like construction, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and water. The systematic review is based on 287 papers selected out of 8341 search results with an application of PRISMA based method. Out of all the techniques used in sustainability regression, RL and DSS-based AI models are more popular than others. The review also provides directions surrounding which industrial sectors are using which methods for incorporating sustainable development practices in their organization.

AB  - Biodiversity is crucial for environmentally- and nutritionally-sustainable food supply. Yet often its roles have been under-recognised, with rich local resources of biodiversity that could support more sustainable future food production being lost. Published meta-analyses and systematic reviews however also reveal that biodiversity's beneficial roles are context specific, depending on the particular production system and environment. Along with the trajectory of global food systems toward homogenisation, this presents challenges for biodiversity in supporting future food supply. Practical implementation of biodiversity-based food production options requires not only that these options are 'biologically' productive, but must address many additional factors such as the transaction costs of knowledge acquisition for practice adoption. Further understanding the drivers behind trends in food systems, at a cross-sectoral level, is essential.

AB  - Our paper describes the application of a realist approach to synthesizing evidence from 31 articles examining the environmental outcomes of marine protected areas governed under different types of property regimes. The development of resource tenure interventions that promote sustainable management practices has been challenged by the difficulties of determining how contextual factors affect environmental outcomes given the complexity of socio-ecological systems. Realist synthesis is a promising evidence review technique for identifying the mechanisms that influence policy intervention outcomes in complex systems. Through a combination of inductive and deductive analysis of the links between context, mechanisms, and outcomes, realist synthesis can help clarify when, how, where, and why property regime interventions are likely to result in positive environmental outcomes. Our study revealed the importance of disaggregating property regimes into sub-categories, rather than treating them as homogenous categories, More importantly, use of a realist synthesis approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which three mechanisms perceptions of legitimacy, perceptions of the likelihood of benefits, and perceptions of enforcement capacity interact under different socio-ecological contexts to trigger behavioral changes that affect environmental conditions. The approach revealed the multi-faceted and interactive nature of perceptions of legitimacy, in which legal legitimacy, social acceptability, and ecological credibility combined to create robust legitimacy. The existence of robust legitimacy in turn appeared to be an important contributor to the success of regulatory systems reliant on voluntary compliance. Our study contributes to the field of natural resources governance by demonstrating the utility of a systematic review method which has received little attention by property scholars but which has promise to clarify understanding of how complex systems work. Our study also highlights that achieving long-term sustainability requires paying greater attention to the mechanisms that support or undermine people's willingness to voluntarily engage in conservation behaviors.

AB  - Background The Indonesian Republic plans to relocate its capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan, Borneo Island, in the next few years. This relocation may be associated with deforestation, decreased biodiversity, and an increased risk of emerging zoonotic infections, including Plasmodium knowlesi malaria. The Malaysian part of Borneo Island is one of the main hotspots of P. knowlesi malaria. Methods Considering this risk, we evaluated the transmission dynamics of P. knowlesi in the Indonesian Archipelago based on a literature search and extensive review of data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Results We report that 545 P. knowlesi cases were documented in Indonesia, mainly in the Aceh and North Sumatra provinces, with 95% of these occurring in the last 4 years. Conclusions The main P. knowlesi vectors are present in the area of the future capital, requiring strengthened surveillance to reduce the risk of emerging cases in a rapidly growing population.

AB  - Future Internet is a general term that is used to refer to the study of new Internet architectures that emphasize the advancements that are paving the way for the next generation of internet. Today's internet has become more complicated and arduous to manage due to its increased traffic. This traffic is a result of the transfer of 247 billion emails, the management of more than a billion websites and 735 active top-level domains, the viewing of at least one billion YouTube videos per day (which is the source of main traffic), and the uploading of more than 2.5 billion photos to Facebook every year. The internet was never anticipated to provide quality of service (QoS) support, but one can have a best effort service that provides support for video streams and downloaded media applications. Therefore, the future architecture of the internet becomes crucial. Furthermore, the internet as a service has witnessed many evolving conflicts among its stakeholders, leading to extensive research. This article presents a systematic review of the internet's evolution and discusses the ongoing research efforts towards new internet architectures, as well as the challenges that are faced in increasing the network's performance and quality. Moreover, as part of these anticipated future developments, this article draws attention to the Metaverse, which combines the emerging areas of augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and extended reality, and is considered to be the next frontier for the future internet. This article examines the key role of the blockchain in organizing and advancing the applications and services within the Metaverse. It also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of future internet research. Finally, the article outlines certain directions for future internet research, particularly in the context of utilizing blockchains in the Metaverse.

AB  - Invasive alien plants represent a major threat to Ireland's biodiversity and ecosystems, not only in productive or disturbed areas but also in habitats of high conservation value. With a focus on the major terrestrial invasive alien plants occurring in Ireland, we performed a systematic review of current knowledge on a wide range of environmental impacts of plant invasions. These include modifications to native or resident plant communities, alterations in the functioning of native ecosystems and associated ecosystem services, including supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services, as well as any positive effects. Overall, we found that rigorous quantitative assessments of the ecological impacts of these species, including comparative studies, are available for few species only and mainly focus on changes in the standing vegetation, while there is a paucity of data on how or if they contribute to alterations in the services provided by native ecosystems, even in protected areas. We conclude by highlighting the need for information on the long-term impacts of plant invasions in Ireland, including potential local, regional, or national extinctions, and the regeneration potential of native plant communities in invaded areas, which ultimately depend on the reversibility of these impacts.

AB  - This paper is a response to calls for more research into the regional-as opposed to global-level of international business operations (Rugman and Verbeke, 2004). Focusing on a key issue in international management, the standardization decision, this paper presents a systematic review of top journal articles published over the last five decades on the subject of advertising standardization at the regional level. The results of this review demonstrate that in the last decade studies have frequently taken a regional rather than international focus of analysis, suggesting a shift in research in line with regionalization theory. However, this study also shows that research on regional standardization has lacked consistency in relation to how the phenomenon should be defined and measured. We present a conceptualization of measurement approaches to international advertising standardization, propose a typology of approaches and discuss their implications for knowledge advancement in the area.

AB  - Biological invasions threaten biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, requiring substantial conservation and management efforts. To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1,149 scientific articles mentioning both "conservation planning" and "alien" or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10% focused on the marine environment. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e., alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the "avoid" approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a "protect" or "avoid" approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment. Gaps and needs for further research are discussed and we propose an 11-step framework to account for biological invasions into the systematic conservation planning design.

AB  - Background: The remote, dispersed, and multicultural population of Canada presents unique challenges for health care services. Currently, virtual care solutions are being offered as an innovative solution to improve access to care.Objective: Given the inequities in health care access faced by immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous Canadians, this review aimed to summarize information obtained from original research regarding these people's experiences with virtual care services in Canada. Methods: We conducted a rapid review following published recommendations. MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for studies relating to virtual care and Canadian immigrants, refugees, or Indigenous peoples. Peer-reviewed articles of any type were included so long as they included information on the experiences of virtual care service delivery in Canada among the abovementioned groups. Results: This review demonstrates an extreme paucity of evidence examining the experiences of immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous groups with virtual care in Canada. Of the 694 publications screened, 8 were included in this review. A total of 2 studies focused on immigrants and refugees in Canada, with the remaining studies focusing on Indigenous communities.Results demonstrate that virtual care is generally accepted within these communities; however, cultural appropriateness or safety and inequitable access to wireless services in certain communities were among the most cited barriers.Conclusions: Little evidence exists outlining immigrants', refugees', and Indigenous peoples' perspectives on the landscape of virtual care in Canada. The development of virtual care programming should take into consideration the barriers, facilitators, and recommendations outlined in this review to improve equitable access. Further, developers should consult with local community members to ensure the appropriateness of services for immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous communities in Canada.

AB  - Background: The use of physical activity (PA) electronic devices offers a unique opportunity to engage children and adolescents in PA. For this age group (2-17 years), parents play a key role in promoting healthy lifestyles and regulating the use of electronic devices. Therefore, parents' perceptions of the use of electronic devices for PA in children and adolescents are critical for efficient intervention. Objective: The aim of this qualitative systematic review was to improve the understanding of parents' perceptions of the use of electronic devices for PA in children and adolescents.Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline/PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGrey, and Deep Blue) was conducted. Studies from inception (2010) to May 2022 were identified. Qualitative studies on the perceptions of healthy children's and adolescents' (aged 2-17 years) parents regarding PA interventions performed on electronic devices were included according to the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group Guidance Series and the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement. The Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument was used for methodological validity.Results: In total, 18 studies with 410 parents, mostly mothers, were included. Parents' perceptions were grouped into 4 categories: usefulness, advantages, general perceptions (electronic devices for health promotion, preferences for real-life PA, and concerns), and acceptability (barriers and facilitators) of electronic devices for PA. Parents perceived electronic devices as useful for increasing PA, learning new skills, and increasing motivation for PA and valued those devices that promoted socialization and family and peer bonding. In terms of general perceptions, parents had positive attitudes toward PA electronic devices; however, they preferred outdoor and real-life PA, especially for preschoolers and children. Concerns, such as physical and psychological harm, addiction, conflicts, and compliance difficulties, were found. Facilitators were identified as ease of use, appropriate feedback, promotion of socialization, and motivational strategies, such as rewards, challenges, and attractiveness. Barriers, such as discomfort, price, and difficulties in using or understanding electronic devices, were also identified. For older children and adolescents, parents were more concerned about high levels of screen time and setting limits on electronic devices and therefore preferred PA electronic devices rather than traditional ones.Conclusions: Overall, the participants had positive attitudes toward electronic devices for PA and perceived them as an effective way to promote PA in children and adolescents. They also perceived several benefits of using electronic devices, such as health promotion, increased awareness and motivation, and socialization, as well as barriers, facilitators, and age differences. The results of this study could provide researchers with insights into designing more effective, age-appropriate PA electronic devices for children and adolescents and improving adherence to their use.Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42021292340; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=292340(JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2023;11:e44753) doi: 10.2196/44753

AB  - Purpose of Review This review aimed to investigate the association of sustainable diets in relation to cancer risk, cancer recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality in adults. Recent Findings More than 500 articles were initially identified. Nine articles were eligible for inclusion, presenting data from 8 prospective cohort studies, conducted in Europe and the USA. The sustainability indicators investigated were greenhouse gas emissions, food biodiversity, land use, exposure to pesticides or organic food consumption, and the EAT-Lancet diet. One study reported a sustainability index that combined multiple sustainability indicators. A modest inverse association between higher adherence to sustainable diets and cancer incidence or cancer mortality was observed in most studies. Summary While sustainable diets may decrease cancer risk or mortality, the reviewed studies were heterogeneous regarding sustainability indicators and cancer outcomes. A common definition of dietary sustainability would facilitate better generalization of future research findings. Also, studies among non-western populations are needed.

AB  - Purpose The United Nation's 2030 mission provides scholars, practitioners and governments with a valuable framework to direct their research in a way that tackles societal issues. Towards this aim, some key Sustainable Development Goals focus on improving the well-being of humans and societies; however, the literature dealing with individual financial well-being is still underdeveloped and fragmented. To address this significant research gap, this paper reviews the literature on financial well-being. It provides an in-depth analysis of different theories, mediators and moderators employed in financial well-being studies to deepen the theoretical framework and widen the scope of financial well-being research.Design/methodology/approach Using the Web of Science Core Collection database (WoS), the literature on financial well-being was reviewed (n = 32) following a systematic review approach.Findings Findings revealed that (a) there is a limited application of theories in financial well-being studies (n = 19) with the majority of studies (n = 15) employing only one theory; (b) twenty-one different theories were used with the maximum number of theories employed by any study was four; (c) the theory of planned behavior was the most commonly used (n = 4); (d) While a reasonable number of studies examine mediators and moderators in antecedents-financial well-being relationships, studies examining mediators and moderators relationships in financial well-being-outcomes relationships are limited. Based on these findings, this review identified a need for future theory-based financial well-being research and examining the role of underlying and intervening mechanisms in antecedents-financial well-being-outcomes relationships.Originality/value The study concludes by suggesting some relevant theories and prospective variables that can explain potential financial well-being relationships. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first review on the use of theories, mediators and moderators in financial well-being studies.

AB  - Even though climate change is having an increasing impact on tea plants, systematic reviews on the impact of climate change on the tea system are scarce. This review was undertaken to assess and synthesize the knowledge around the impacts of current and future climate on yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea; the historical roots and the most influential papers on the aforementioned topics; and the key adaptation and mitigation strategies that are practiced in tea fields. Our findings show that a large number of studies have focused on the impact of climate change on tea quality, followed by tea yield, while a smaller number of studies have concentrated on climate suitability. Three pronounced reference peaks found in Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RYPS) represent the most significant papers associated with the yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea. Tea yield increases with elevated CO2 levels, but this increment could be substantially affected by an increasing temperature. Other climatic factors are uneven rainfall, extreme weather events, and climate-driven abiotic stressors. An altered climate presents both advantages and disadvantages for tea quality due to the uncertainty of the concentrations of biochemicals in tea leaves. Climate change creates losses, gains, and shifts of climate suitability for tea habitats. Further studies are required in order to fill the knowledge gaps identified through the present review, such as an investigation of the interaction between the tea plant and multiple environmental factors that mimic real-world conditions and then studies on its impact on the tea system, as well as the design of ensemble modeling approaches to predict climate suitability for tea. Finally, we outline multifaceted and evidence-based adaptive and mitigation strategies that can be implemented in tea fields to alleviate the undesirable impacts of climate change.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the tourism industry has witnessed a range of health-related crises, with the recent outbreak of COVID-19 bringing the industry to a standstill. This systematic literature review serves to understand previous health crises, impacts, and consequences in the tourism industry and identify the current status, intellectual structure, and trends in this research field. A bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and Gephi was performed over 63 journal articles from 2003 to 2021 indexed in Scopus. Results reveal a research focus shift towards sustainable tourism development. Moreover, the status quo indicates a need for closer research collaboration across continents and more interdisciplinary research in health science and tourism to better understand the broad impacts of pandemic outbreaks and generate new insights into this complex issue.

AB  - With this first systematic review of specific literature about diaspora marketing, it was found that this emerging literature focuses mainly on opportunities related to trade, tourism, and the acculturation between countries with different languages in only one host country. This research contributes toward a greater understanding of diaspora buying behavior using the construal level theory, specifically regarding the purchase of nostalgic products and services, examining the case of Venezuelan diaspora in the broader international context of five host countries: Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Panama Another contribution is the use of e-WOM metrics derived from advertising posts on Instagram. The results show that diaspora consumers in host countries that have higher levels of individualism, less masculinity, and are further geographically from their homeland seek to consume greater amounts of nostalgic products.

AB  - Agroforestry (AF) is a relevant socio-ecological system in Mediterranean countries that plays a remarkable role in providing ecosystem services (ES). However, AF ecosystems have been declining (e.g. due to land abandonment), compromising the provision of some ES, such as fire regulating services. As a result, Portugal has introduced new legislation to promote fire-smart landscapes through reconversion towards traditional AF, including a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme that demands the development of long-term ES monitoring frameworks to guide managers and practitioners. Hence, it is crucial to identify SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive) proxy indicators for AF ES that are cost-effective for long-term use. Thus, this review aims to understand the progress, emerging gaps and opportunities in remote sensing (RS) technologies, particularly by using freely accessible spaceborne multispectral satellite images to assess and monitor agroforestry ES. With only fifteen studies meeting the review criteria, it was possible to confirm that RS was a valuable tool for estimating and monitoring at least eleven ES (three provisioning and eight regulation and maintenance ES). Sentinel-2, a medium spatial resolution satellite from the Copernicus Programme, offers a cost-effective solution for providing ES proxies due to its spatial resolution, continuity, affordability, and accessibility. However, smallholder landscapes may require higher-resolution satellite imagery, especially for carbon stock monitoring in the PES schemes.

AB  - Background: The protective (herd) effect of the selective vaccination of pubertal girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) implies a high probability that one of the two partners involved in intercourse is immunised, hence preventing the other from this sexually transmitted infection. The dynamic transmission models used to inform immunisation policy should include consideration of sexual behaviours and population mixing in order to demonstrate an ecological validity, whereby the scenarios modelled remain faithful to the real-life social and cultural context. The primary aim of this review is to test the ecological validity of the universal HPV vaccination cost-effectiveness modelling available in the published literature.
   Methods: The research protocol related to this systematic review has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42016034145). Eight published economic evaluations were reviewed.
   Results: None of the studies showed due consideration of the complexities of human sexual behaviour and the impact this may have on the transmission of HPV.
   Discussion: Our findings indicate that all the included models might be affected by a different degree of ecological bias, which implies an inability to reflect the natural demographic and behavioural trends in their outcomes and, consequently, to accurately inform public healthcare policy. In particular, ecological bias have the effect to over-estimate the preference-based outcomes of selective immunisation. A relatively small (15-20%) over-estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with selective immunisation programmes could induce a significant error in the estimate of cost-effectiveness of universal immunisation, by inflating its incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) beyond the acceptability threshold. The results modelled here demonstrate the limitations of the cost-effectiveness studies for HPV vaccination, and highlight the concern that public healthcare policy might have been built upon incomplete studies.

AB  - Critical thermal limits (CTLs) constrain the performance of organisms, shaping their abundance, current distributions, and future distributions. Consequently, CTLs may also determine the quality of ecosystem services as well as organismal and ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. As some of the most ubiquitous animals in terrestrial ecosystems, ants are important members of ecological communities. In recent years, an increasing body of research has explored ant physiological thermal limits. However, these CTL data tend to centre on a few species and biogeographical regions. To encourage an expansion of perspectives, we herein review the factors that determine ant CTLs and examine their effects on present and future species distributions and ecosystem processes. Special emphasis is placed on the implications of CTLs for safeguarding ant diversity and ant-mediated ecosystem services in the future. First, we compile, quantify, and categorise studies on ant CTLs based on study taxon, biogeographical region, methodology, and study question. Second, we use this comprehensive database to analyse the abiotic and biotic factors shaping ant CTLs. Our results highlight how CTLs may affect future distribution patterns and ecological performance in ants. Additionally, we identify the greatest remaining gaps in knowledge and create a research roadmap to promote rapid advances in this field of study.

AB  - Urban blue-green spaces hold immense potential for supporting the sustainability and liveability of cities through the provision of urban ecosystem services (UES). However, research on UES in the Global South has not been reviewed as systematically as in the Global North. In Southeast Asia, the nature and extent of the biases, imbalances and gaps in UES research are unclear. We address this issue by conducting a systematic review of UES research in Southeast Asia over the last twenty years. Our findings draw attention to the unequal distribution of UES research within the region, and highlight common services, scales and features studied, as well as methods undertaken in UES research. We found that while studies tend to assess regulating and cultural UES at a landscape scale, few studies examined interactions between services by assessing synergies and tradeoffs. Moreover, the bias in research towards megacities in the region may overlook less-developed nations, rural areas, and peri-urban regions and their unique perspectives and preferences towards UES management. We discuss the challenges and considerations for integrating and conducting research on UES in Southeast Asia based on its unique and diverse socio-cultural characteristics. We conclude our review by highlighting aspects of UES research that need more attention in order to support land use planning and decision-making in Southeast Asia.

AB  - Keeping track of conceptual and methodological developments is a critical skill for research scientists, but this task is increasingly difficult due to the high rate of academic publication. As a crisis discipline, conservation science is particularly in need of tools that facilitate rapid yet insightful synthesis. We show how a common text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic modeling) and statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis, regression, and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these methods on the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators. Analysis of topic popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis on monitoring and management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of research gaps suggested a greater role for genetic surrogates and indicators. Our results show that automated text analysis methods need to be used with care, but can provide information that is complementary to that given by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, increasing scientists' capacity for research synthesis.

AB  - European agriculture is a sector that is in a decisive moment of transformation. The transition from small farms to viable and sustainable businesses is difficult and often traumatic. One of the ways to face these changes is through the grouping of farmers creating agri-food cooperatives. This model has proven successful in Sweden or Finland but has not been developed equally in all territories. Romania is a country with no deep-rooted cooperative tradition. However, it has exciting and promising initiatives that may represent an alternative development path, especially in rural areas. This paper addresses the current situation of agri-food cooperatives in Romania, analysing its immediate past and exploring the opportunities that arise in the future through a scientific literature review. Results help to better address future actions on cooperative promotion.

AB  - Ecosystem services losses have worsened already serious urban problems such as heat island effects, urban flooding, and biodiversity losses. Urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) is the main carrier of ecosystem services in urban areas and provides a promising approach to combat such urban challenges and at the same time increases urban sustainability and resilience. The objectives of this special volume (SV) were to provide systematic reviews and discussions of the new governance, engineering and technologies available for improving UEI, which can be used to promote the development application of improved urban ecological engineering theories, methods and tools. Seven themes are included in this SV: (1) From civil infrastructure to ecological infrastructure: diagnoses and remedies of urban illnesses; (2) International experiences and lessons in urban "green-blue" ecological engineering to develop and to enforce standards for restoration of natural and social ecosystem services; (3) Implementation of integrated urban waste management, recycling and treatment policies and facilities; (4) Design and modify urban impervious surfaces through ecological engineering; (5) Urban aorta ecology, ecological mobility and livable corridors; (6) Integrative design criteria and cases of urban ecological infrastructure management; (7) The roles of urban ecological infrastructure in industrial parks and industrial clusters. This SV included forty-one, high-quality papers on theories and practices in UEI and in urban sustainability. Concepts, principles, theories, innovative assessment models, successful experiences, barriers to and enablers of UEI implementation were discussed. The authors provide a solid foundation and foster new inspiration to catalyze more ecologically sound and sustainable urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Due to risk factors such as climate change, habitat destruction, overhunting and pollution, bird extinctions are now occurring at a rate that far exceeds their speciation rate. There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. The statistical methods which are used to model and evaluate the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using citizen science data are reviewed in this study. Citizen science data helps to increase the number of records, thereby improving our understanding of the dynamics in declining bird species populations.
   Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines a comprehensive systematic review was performed using three databases: ProQuest Central, Scopus and Web of Science from January 1900 to January 2019. Only journal articles which analysed the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using a statistical model, predictive model or a trend analysis, developed using citizen science data were included in this study. Bird species in near threatened or least concern categories that are declining in population/range were also included, since these may be the next wave of species to be added to the endangered species lists.
   Results: Most of the 39 unique studies describing statistical models for this purpose used generalized linear models, followed by hierarchical/linear mixed models, machine learning models and persistence probability models respectively. A quality assessment tool was created in order to evaluate these articles. The review suggested several methods for measuring the persistence of threatened bird species, but there was no attempt to identify critical tipping points using methods such as change-point analysis.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that the persistence of threatened bird species varies depending on various risk factors which need to be addressed in order to produce better outcomes for the conservation of threatened birds. This review reveals the most suitable statistical methods for this purpose. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Proactive approaches that anticipate the long-term effects of current and future conservation threats could increase the effectiveness and efficiency of biodiversity conservation. However, such approaches can be obstructed by a lack of knowledge of habitat requirements for wildlife. To aggregate and assess the suitability of current information available on habitat requirements needed for proactive conservation, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on elephant and rhinoceros habitat requirements and synthesized data by combining a vote counting assessment with bibliometric and term maps. We contextualized these numeric and terminological results with a narrative review. We mapped current methods, results, terminology, and collaborations of 693 studies. Quantitative evidence for factors that influence the suitability of an area for elephants and rhinoceros was biased toward African savanna elephants and ecological variables. Less than one third of holistic approaches considered equal amounts of ecological and anthropogenic variables in their assessments. There was a general lack of quantitative evidence for direct proxies of anthropogenic variables that were expected to play an important role based on qualitative evidence and policy documents. However, there was evidence for a segregation in conceptual frameworks among countries and species and between science versus policy literature. There was also evidence of unused potential for collaborations among southern hemisphere researchers. Our results indicated that the success of proactive conservation interventions can be increased if ecological and anthropogenic dimensions are integrated into holistic habitat assessments and holistic carrying capacities and quantitative evidence for anthropogenic variables is improved. To avoid wasting limited resources, it is necessary to form inclusive collaborations within and across networks of researchers studying different species across regional and continental borders and in the science-policy realm.

AB  - Ecosystem services are an important nexus between people and nature. Nevertheless, their inclusion in place -based conservation and management is limited also because they are often intangible. The Ecological Infra-structure (EI) concept is a promising framework to address this, but a clear definition and mapping approach is still missing. We aim to analyse the uses of EI and to distil a definition and recommendations for using EI as a framework for mapping ecosystem services. A semi-systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to examine: (1) perceptions of what constitutes EI (n = 117), and (2) EI mapping approaches (n = 51). The main interpretations of EI indicated that it should be natural or naturally functioning (56%); deliver multiple services (75%); and benefit humans (64%) and biodiversity (36%). EI was thus defined as 'natural and naturally functioning ecological systems or networks of ecological systems that deliver multiple services to humans and enable biodiversity persistence'. Studies have used simple proxies, e.g., land cover, to identify EI, sometimes combined with service-specific variables. To evaluate EI performance (26% of studies), modelling all three ecosystem service aspects (capacity, flow, and demand) was considered appropriate. EI prioritisation (50% of studies) as part of a systematic spatial prioritisation process was recommended. Sixteen recommendations for mapping EI for inclusion in place-based conservation and management were developed. We illustrate how EI can be used to integrate ecosystem services into conservation and management in three real-world applications. The EI-based framework is a promising approach and supports the new 'people and nature' era in conservation.

AB  - here is a need to conceive and support bioeconomy strategies within the context of sustainable development in the European Union. A holistic vision regarding the deployment of research on promising biomass crops, such as miscanthus, for bio-based industries, is therefore required to identify the actors, the drivers and the barriers shaping the sector's development outlook. Despite the large number of research studies on miscanthus, doubts remain about its interest from agronomic, socio-economic and technological aspects. A policy-based analysis is firstly developed to understand the research orientation in the period from 1953 to 2019. Combining literature review with network analysis, a comprehensive approach is performed to investigate the research interactions and orientation. Through analysis of research funding, the key factors in propelling the development of miscanthus sector are also identified. Having been in stand-by for many years, the growth of miscanthus supply chain has recently been accelerated with the rise of biorefinery concept by the end of 2009 as well as with the implementation of climate-energy framework agreed in 2014. Though, regional disparities in terms of number of research studies exist between the North, the Centre and the South of Europe, the creation of research and development support programmes notwithstanding. Furthermore, research orientation and funding mechanisms strongly depend on national strategies and priorities, and the barriers hampering the sector's development. The efforts were generally pushed towards assessing the agronomic, environmental and economic potential and identifying sustainable and cost-efficient biomass conversion technologies as well. Policies, collaborations and research funding are still shaping the sector, thereby coping with existing barriers to bring about competitive and breakthrough technologies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Road traffic accidents are the most frequent cause of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly among young populations worldwide. Helmets are proven to prevent injuries; however, estimates of helmet compliance are low globally. Surgical/critical care management of TBI is often used to treat these injuries, but primary prevention should be recommended. A key component in promoting TBI prevention among pediatric and young populations is through helmet legislation. The authors investigated helmet policies for motorcycles and bicycles globally to provide recommendations for how related legislation may impact TBI and guide advocacy in pediatric neurosurgery.
   METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review of helmet laws and/or policies by using the National Library of Medicine PubMed and SCOPUS databases. Additional articles were identified using citation searches of key publications. Abstracts from articles of all sources were read and selected for full-text review. Details of relevant full articles were extracted and analyzed for the following: bibliographic data, study aim, design and duration, study participants, intervention characteristics, and intervention effect data.
   RESULTS Of 618 search results, 53 full- text articles were analyzed for recommendations. Helmet legislation is associated with increased helmet use among bicyclists and decreased road traffic accident-related head injuries and fatalities among motorcyclists and bicyclists. Laws are more effective if comprehensive and inclusive of the following: both primary riders and passengers, all age groups, all modes of transportation made safer by helmets, a proper use clause, and standardized helmet quality measures. Cultural, socioeconomic, and infrastructural circumstances are important as well, and legislation must consider enforcement mechanisms with penalties significant enough to incentivize behavioral changes, but proportional to community socioeconomic status.
   CONCLUSIONS Compulsory use laws are the optimal primary intervention; however, concurrent programs to support financial access to helmets, change cultural attitudes, increase health literacy, and improve road infrastructure will augment legislative benefits. Pediatric neurosurgeons are caretakers of children suffering from TBI. Although extensive study has explored the surgical management of TBI, the authors believe that primary prevention is instrumental to improving outcomes and reducing injury. All helmet laws are not equal; based on these findings, a comprehensive, contextspecific approach is the key to success, especially in resource-limited countries.

AB  - The Human Mobility Transition model describes shifts in mobility dynamics and transport systems. The aspirational stage, 'human urbanism', is characterised by high active travel, universal public transport, low private vehicle use and equitable access to transport. We explored factors associated with travel behaviour in Africa and the Caribbean, investigating the potential to realise 'human urbanism' in this context. We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of ten databases and grey literature for articles published between January 2008 and February 2019. We appraised study quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. We narratively synthesized qualitative and quantitative data, using meta-study principles to integrate the findings. We identified 39,404 studies through database searching, mining reviews, reference screening, and topic experts' consultation. We included 129 studies (78 quantitative, 28 mixed-methods, 23 qualitative) and 33 grey literature documents. In marginalised groups, including the poor, people living rurally or peripheral to cities, women and girls, and the elderly, transport was poorly accessible, travel was characterised by high levels of walking and paratransit (informal public transport) use, and low private vehicle use. Poorly controlled urban growth (density) and sprawl (expansion), with associated informality, was a salient aspect of this context, resulting in long travel distances and the necessity of motorised transportation. There were existing population-level assets in relation to 'human urbanism' (high levels of active travel, good paratransit coverage, low private vehicle use) as well as core challenges (urban sprawl and informality, socioeconomic and gendered barriers to travel, poor transport accessibility). Ineffective mobility systems were a product of uncoordinated urban planning, unregulated land use and subsequent land use conflict. To realise 'human urbanism', integrated planning policies recognising the linkages between health, transport and equity are needed. A shift in priority from economic growth to a focus on broader population needs and the rights and wellbeing of ordinary people is required. Policymakers should focus attention on transport accessibility for the most vulnerable.

AB  - Mangroves shift from carbon sinks to sources when affected by anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change (LULCC). Yet, the magnitude and temporal scale of these impacts are largely unknown. We undertook a systematic review to examine the influence of LULCC on mangrove carbon stocks and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes. A search of 478 data points from the peer-reviewed literature revealed a substantial reduction of biomass (82% +/- 35%) and soil (54% +/- 13%) carbon stocks due to LULCC. The relative loss depended on LULCC type, time since LULCC and geographical and climatic conditions of sites. We also observed that the loss of soil carbon stocks was linked to the decreased soil carbon content and increased soil bulk density over the first 100 cm depth. We found no significant effect of LULCC on soil GHG effluxes. Regeneration efforts (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation and afforestation) led to biomass recovery after similar to 40 years. However, we found no clear patterns of mangrove soil carbon stock re-establishment following biomass recovery. Our findings suggest that regeneration may help restore carbon stocks back to pre-disturbed levels over decadal to century time scales only, with a faster rate for biomass recovery than for soil carbon stocks. Therefore, improved mangrove ecosystem management by preventing further LULCC and promoting rehabilitation is fundamental for effective climate change mitigation policy.

AB  - The latest global air traffic shows a positive sign of a tremendous recovery in worldwide air traffic post-pandemic. This paper aims at providing a systematic literature review on air traffic conflict detection and resolution (CDR) in air traffic control (ATC) from ergonomics perspectives and developing a framework underlying the CDR processes to retort the bounce-back of air traffic density. A preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) was adopted to conduct the review of prior publications in ATC CDR. Based on the 35 literatures reviewed, a framework of CDR is produced highlighting the key aspects of ATC as a socio-technical system including humans, environment, interface/system, and task. The present study also sheds light on future research directions covering acceleration of ATC proficiency, design of ATC systems, analysis of global traffic patterns, ATC automation transparency, and task designs to enhance air traffic safety and efficiency. The take-away points from the growing body of literatures on ATC CDR are discussed further in this paper.

AB  - Problem statement: Climate change and its consequences influence all environmental, social, and economic conditions of cities. One of the most important ideas to overcome urban issues is implementing urban greening (UG) to improve the ecology and sustainability of cities; however, the manner ofadopting this idea is facing numerous challenges. In recent years, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have proposed an emerging and comprehensive concept for solving the ecological and social challenges of cities at macro and micro levels.Research objective: The main goal ofthe research is to identify and analyze the concept ofNbS in solving the challenge of managing urban green structures from both theoretical and practical dimensions. Based on this concept, the current research to answer the question ofhow and in what dimensions NbS, as a comprehensive concept, may support the process of greening cities.Research mthod: This study investigates the concepts and principles of NBS and extracts its features by applying the systematic review of theoretical foundations and adopting the analytical method; it is followed by targeting the added values and its conceptual and operational obstacles by addressing the concept of UG.Conclusion: NbS as a transdisciplinary and collaborative concept, by considering the dynamics of the environment, suggests planning for long-term projects with specific solutions for each place while preserving natural, biological, and cultural values to solve the complex challenges. Most of the features and principles of these solutions overlap with UG concepts, and from the operational aspect, they are a suitable and relatively comprehensive approach for implementing the desired concepts compared to UG approaches. However, a more precise definition is required to address the conceptual nature of NbS, as they are still encountering theoretical and practical obstacles. These conceptual barriers trigger both basic concepts and explanations of perceptual dimensions, while the implementation barriers consist of weak communication between organizations, and between them and the related stakeholders, which includes the temporal-spatial dimensions as well. According to the three-case method ('concept', 'principles & characteristics', and 'implementation processes'), the study mainly focuses on two main categories to remove obstacles: 1) considering the features of entirety and multiplicity to resolve the conceptual obstacles, 2) defining the principles of Realism and the applicability, process-based concept, and acceptability of solutions in eliminating the implementation obstacles.

AB  - Woodland expansion is internationally accepted as a strategy to reduce biodiversity loss, climate change and flood risk, but there has been limited assessment of the evidence for these benefits. In addition, despite UK targets for woodland creation, planting levels remain low. Furthermore, following the UK's decision to leave the European Union, a number of important decisions will be made about support mechanisms for different land uses, making evidence for the effect of woodland creation in different contexts essential. Following established guidelines, we undertook a systematic review of 160 articles to assess the evidence base for the effects of woodland expansion on ecosystem services in a UK context. We aimed to characterise the evidence base on the effects of such woodland expansion on biodiversity and ES and highlight where further research might be required. We found that the evidence base is dominated by research studying conifer plantations, and outcomes relating to biodiversity and regulating ecosystem services. By contrast, evidence for the effect of afforestation on multiple ecosystem services, cultural, and provisioning services is severely lacking. We argue that this weighting of evidence towards 'public goods' may contribute to the observed lack of planting, and that evidence for more tangible effects of woodland creation in relation other land uses is lacking. Implementation of woodland expansion could benefit from developing new incentives for planting woodlands, based on 'public money for public goods'. Future research should focus on the evidence gaps identified here, making use of context-specific, transdisciplinary, participatory methodologies which take into account plural values held in relation to the landscape.

AB  - In this paper, we identify the essential organizational characteristics of local government that are crucial for smart urban governance. To do, we conducted a systematic review of 96 articles on this theme. Through a qualitative analysis of these articles, we identified three main characteristics. The first is that governance is related to the nature of the relationship among individuals, interest groups, institutions, and government. It can be participative, collaborative or co-creative, and its mechanisms can be online, offline or a combination of both. The second is assets, which are useful or valuable elements providing support to smart urban governance projects in the form of funding, technology and human capital. The third includes management, involving elements of strategy and the positioning of local public administration, such as suitability in a legal context, vision and leadership, principles, project design, communication, strategy and also organizational and cultural elements.

AB  - Increased Muslim immigration and conversion to Islam have influenced the rise of Islamic schools in western nation-states. Islamic schools are both formal and informal. This paper summarizes literature on Islamic schooling in the cultural west with respect to three policy-relevant issues: (1) the purpose and nature of Islamic schooling; (2) parental wishes; and (3) the quality of Islamic schooling. The initial search process resulted in 12,535 articles, 81 of which inform the current review. The review reveals a variation in education policy issues in which some countries fund private Islamic schools and others provide Islamic religious instruction in public schools. The review discusses potential solutions to address parental wishes and improve the quality of Islamic schooling. Based on the reviewed literature, the review suggests guidelines for future research.

AB  - Building operations represent a significant percentage of the total primary energy consumed in most countries due to the proliferation of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) installations in response to the growing demand for improved thermal comfort. Reducing the associated energy consumption while maintaining comfortable conditions in buildings are conflicting objectives and represent a typical optimization problem that requires intelligent system design. Over the last decade, different methodologies based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been deployed to find the sweet spot between energy use in HVAC systems and suitable indoor comfort levels to the occupants. This paper performs a comprehensive and an in-depth systematic review of AI-based techniques used for building control systems by assessing the outputs of these techniques, and their implementations in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve the energyefficiency, while maintaining thermal comfort conditions. This enables a holistic view of (1) the complexities of delivering thermal comfort to users inside buildings in an energy-efficient way, and (2) the associated bibliographic material to assist researchers and experts in the field in tackling such a challenge. Among the 20 AI tools developed for both energy consumption and comfort control, functions such as identification and recognition patterns, optimization, predictive control. Based on the findings of this work, the application of AI technology in building control is a promising area of research and still an ongoing, i.e., the performance of AIbased control is not yet completely satisfactory. This is mainly due in part to the fact that these algorithms usually need a large amount of high-quality real-world data, which is lacking in the building or, more precisely, the energy sector. Based on the current study, from 1993 to 2020, the application of AI techniques and personalized comfort models has enabled energy savings on average between 21.81 and 44.36%, and comfort improvement on average between 21.67 and 85.77%. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges faced in the use of AI for energy productivity and comfort improvement, and opens main future directions in relation with AIbased building control systems for human comfort and energy-efficiency management.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence attests to the efficacy of e-mental health services. There is less evidence on how to facilitate the safe, effective, and sustainable implementation of these services.
   Objective: We conducted a systematic review on e-mental health service use for depressive and anxiety disorders to inform policy development and identify policy-relevant gaps in the evidence base.
   Methods: Following the PRISMA protocol, we identified research (1) conducted in Australia, (2) on e-mental health services, (3) for depressive or anxiety disorders, and (4) on e-mental health usage, such as barriers and facilitators to use. Databases searched included Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest Social Science, and Google Scholar. Sources were assessed according to area and level of policy relevance.
   Results: The search yielded 1081 studies; 30 studies were included for analysis. Most reported on self-selected samples and samples of online help-seekers. Studies indicate that e-mental health services are predominantly used by females, and those who are more educated and socioeconomically advantaged. Ethnicity was infrequently reported on. Studies examining consumer preferences found a preference for face-to-face therapy over e-therapies, but not an aversion to e-therapy. Content relevant to governance was predominantly related to the organizational dimensions of e-mental health services, followed by implications for community education. Financing and payment for e-services and governance of the information communication technology were least commonly discussed.
   Conclusions: Little research focuses explicitly on policy development and implementation planning; most research provides an e-services perspective. Research is needed to provide community and policy-maker perspectives. General population studies of prospective treatment seekers that include ethnicity and socioeconomic status and quantify relative preferences for all treatment modalities are necessary.

TI  - The effectiveness of health appraisal processes currently in addressing health and wellbeing during spatial plan appraisal: a systematic review

AB  - Background: Spatial planning affects the built environment, which in turn has the potential to have a significant impact on health, for good or ill. One way of ensuring that spatial plans take due account of health is through the inclusion of health considerations in the statutory and non statutory appraisal processes linked to plan-making processes.
   Methods: A systematic review to identify evaluation studies of appraisals or assessments of plans where health issues were considered from 1987 to 2010.
   Results: A total of 6161 citations were identified: 6069 from electronic databases, 57 fromwebsite searches, with a further 35 citations from grey literature, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. These 20 citations reported on a total of 135 different case studies: 11 UK HIA; 11 non UK high income countries HIA, 5 UK SEA or other integrated appraisal; 108 non UK high income SEA or other integrated appraisal. All studies were in English. No relevant studies were identified reporting on low or middle income countries.
   The studies were limited by potential bias (no independent evaluation, with those undertaking the appraisal also responsible for reporting outcomes), lack of detail and a lack of triangulation of results. Health impact assessments generally covered the four specified health domains (physical activity, mental health and wellbeing, environmental health issues such as pollution and noise, injury) more comprehensively than SEA or other integrated appraisals, although mental health and wellbeing was an underdeveloped area. There was no evidence available on the incorporation of health in Sustainability Appraisal, limited evidence that the recommendations from any type of appraisal were implemented, and almost no evidence that the recommendations had led to the anticipated outcomes or improvements in health postulated.
   Conclusion: Research is needed to assess (i) the degree to which statutory plan appraisal processes (SA in the UK) incorporate health; (ii) whether recommendations arising from health appraisal translate into the development process and (iii) whether outcomes are as anticipated.

AB  - Ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs have been broadly recognized and studied over the past decade. However, how to coordinate the relationships among ES trade-offs to achieve win-win outcomes remains a considerable challenge for decision makers. Here, we summarize the current approaches applied to minimize ES trade-offs for win-wins and analyze the trade-offs among different ESs and their drivers. Based on a systematic review of the literature from 2005 to 2018, we identified 170 potentially relevant articles, 47 of which were selected for the review, recording 70 actual or potential trade-offs. Analysis of these case studies showed that trade-off pairs between provisioning services and regulating services/biodiversity accounted for 80% of total pairs. Furthermore, more than half of the ES trade-offs were driven by land use/land cover changes. Harvest and resource demand, natural resource management, and policy instruments were also among the main drivers. Four approaches to coordinate ES trade-offs were identified, including ecosystem, landscape-scale, multi-objective optimization, and policy intervention (and other) approaches. Based on the above, we recommend a rigorous understanding of the roles of different stakeholders, spatial scales of management, trade-off dynamics, and integrated implementation of diverse approaches to coordinate ES trade-offs in order to better achieve win-win outcomes.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are increasingly addressed in research, but conceptual and methodological issues still limit their integration into management and decision-making. While most studies have focused on mapping and quantifying CES, less attention has been paid to the final benefits derived from CES. This study systematically reviewed the literature with regard to subjective well-being benefits associated with CES, examining (1) the research context, (2) the assessment of dimensions/types of benefits, (3) drivers of change and management implications, and (4) limitations and future research needs. Based on 160 publications, our results indicate that most addressed benefits were related the dimension of experiences (44.5%), followed by identities (29.3%) and capabilities (26.4%). Disbenefits such as sense of fear, insecurity and noisiness were only mentioned by 21.3% of all publications. Major challenges to overcome current limitations related to methodological issues and knowledge gaps include to strengthen inter-and transdisciplinary collaboration, to deepen the under-standing of the human dimension, to broaden the analysis of a greater number of benefits and disbenefits, as well as to integrate information on specific ecosystems and at large spatial scales, to establish stronger linkages with decision-making and to clarify definitions and concepts. Future studies should address these challenges to generate meaningful information for decision-making and management.

AB  - Simple Summary Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a group of common and aggressive tumors. Recently, oral microbiota has been credited as an important player in carcinogenesis. However, the available knowledge is not always consistent and sometimes conflicting. Therefore, the present comprehensive systematic review of the current clinical reports was conducted to evaluate the role of oral microbiota in HNSCC. Importantly, this study addresses whether oral microbiota targeting could provide diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic utility in cancer patients. We also discussed the current limitations of this newly emerging field and the potential related strategies for the management of patients with HNSCC and possibly other solid tumors. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) comprises the majority of tumors in head and neck tissues. The prognosis of HNSCC has not significantly improved for decades, signifying the need for new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recent evidence suggests that oral microbiota is associated with carcinogenesis. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review to evaluate the current evidence regarding the role of oral microbiota in HNSCC and whether their targeting may confer diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic utility. Following the screening of 233 publications retrieved from multiple databases, 34 eligible studies comprising 2469 patients were compiled and critically appraised. Importantly, many oral pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were linked to certain oral potentially malignant lesions and various types of HNSCC. Furthermore, we summarized the association between the expression profiles of different oral bacterial species and their tumorigenic and prognostic effects in cancer patients. We also discussed the current limitations of this newly emerging area and the potential microbiota-related strategies for preventing and treating HNSCC. Whilst many clinical studies are underway to unravel the role of oral microbiota in cancer, the limited available data and experimental approaches reflect the newness of this promising yet challenging field.

AB  - Evaluating the outcomes of wetland restoration projects is critical to improve practice and justify further investment in wetland restoration. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the economic valuation of the outcomes of wetland restoration. We assessed the economic methods applied, the attributes valued, and the timing of the evaluation in relation to the age of restoration along with publication trends. Research on the topic is increasing, but studies from Africa and South America are lacking. A diverse cross-disciplinary interest is notable, yet collaborations between disciplines are less frequent. Of particular concern is that only a third of the studies were undertaken postrestoration, and even fewer for restorations older than 10 years. Gaps in the knowledge base mean that our present understanding of the value achieved through wetland restoration is tentative. The need for postrestoration site-specific valuation efforts remains large both to justify further investment and to improve confidence in predictive and value transfer approaches as practical tools to inform decision-making.

AB  - Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) is becoming a reference tool for an increasing number of organizations transitioning towards environmental impact neutrality. However, one NCA technique applicable to all types of actors (individual, community, company, etc.) is missing because of the lack of consensus on how to quantify both their environmental impacts and dependencies on ecosystems. A coupled systematic and non-systematic review of the grey and scientific literature is performed here to (i) make an extensive review of state-of-the-art NCA methods, identifying their current utilization and limitations, and (ii) discern prospects about the challenges of integrating an Ecosystem Service Accounting in Life Cycle Assessment (ESA-LCA). While NCA methods can extensively evaluate the supply of ES, they tend to disregard the quantification of environmental impacts that imply a demand for ES. The ESA-LCA approach is identified as a robust solution to balance supply and demand of ecosystem services in NCA, allowing private and public actors to quantify their distance from impact neutrality targets. A novel definition of NC(A) in LCA is also formulated to support these future efforts, promoting a Mitigation Hierarchy-based strategy to avoid, minimize, restore, and offset impacts, and outlining a roadmap for practitioners to apply ESA-LCA across multiple economic sectors.

AB  - The relationship between non-financial reporting quality (NFRQ) and various company-level factors has been studied extensively, considering the mandatory requirements applicable under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive 2014/95/EU (NFRD) of the European Union. The purpose of this research is to systematize the results of previous published studies on the relationship between NFRQ and company size, financial performance, corporate governance, market performance, and sustainability performance, under a mandatory regime. Our study contributes to the literature by proposing a taxonomy of company-level factors grouped into five categories. We analyze the post-2017 period, focusing on the application of NFRD in the European Union. By applying systematic inclusion and exclusion criteria to a population of 618 articles from Scopus, we obtain a sample of fifteen articles that are subject to an in-depth analysis of correlation matrices. The systematic review resorts to the vote counting methodology to assess the existence and strength of relationships between the NFRQ and company-level factors, based on correlation coefficients. The summarized results indicate that company size, corporate governance, and sustainability performance are positive factors of NFRQ. Regarding corporate governance, we find that board independence, board size, foreign ownership, gender diversity, corporate governance quality, the existence of a sustainability committee, and sustainability-linked remuneration positively influence NFRQ. Our findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the role of corporate governance and sustainability performance in improving NFRQ while transitioning to improved corporate sustainability reporting under the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 2022/2464 (CSRD). Our study has implications for academics who seek to engage in empirical research on various factors with positive or negative influence on sustainability reporting, throughout the transition from the NFRD to the CSRD. Policymakers may find our study useful in addressing specific areas of sustainability reporting that have a negative impact on corporate transparency, while practitioners may obtain valuable information on the challenges of transitioning to sustainability reporting and the implementation of mandatory assurance.

AB  - In the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has been traditionally targeted at reducing flood risk. However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climate-sensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities.

AB  - New livestock production models need to simultaneously meet the increasing global demand for meat and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since the 16th century beef cattle has been produced on the Pampas and Campos native grasslands in southern South America, with only small amounts of external inputs. Wesynthesised 242 references from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1945 and mid-2015 and analysed secondary data to examine the evidence on the ecosystem services provided by this grassland biodiversity hotspot and the way they are affected by land use changes and their drivers. The analysis followed the requirements of systematic review from the PRISMA statement (Moher et al 2009 Acad. Clin. Ann. Intern. Med. 151 264-9). The Pampas and Campos provide feed for 43 million heads of cattle and 14 million sheep. The biome is habitat of 4000 native plant species, 300 species of birds, 29 species of mammals, 49 species of reptiles and 35 species of amphibians. The soils of the region stock 5% of the soil organic carbon of Latin America on3% of its area. Driven by high prices of soybean, the soybean area increased by 210% between 2000 and 2010, at the expense of 2 million ha (5%) of native grassland, mostly in the Pampas. Intensification of livestock production was apparent in two spatially distinct forms. In subregions where cropping increased, intensification of livestock production was reflected in an increased use of grains for feed as part of feedlots. In subregions dominated by native grasslands, stocking rates increased. The review showed that land use change and grazing regimes with low forage allowances were predominantly associated with negative effects on ecosystem service provision by reducing soil organic carbon stocks and the diversity of plants, birds and mammals, and by increasing soil erosion. We found little quantitative information on changes in the ecosystem services water provision, nutrient cycling and erosion control. We discuss how changing grazing regimes to higher forage allowance can contribute to greater meat production and enhancing ecosystem services from native grasslands. This would require working with farmers on changing their management strategies and creating enabling economic conditions.

AB  - Background: Clinicians and parents are expected to make medical treatment decisions in the child's best interests. To reach their decisions, clinicians typically apply a principled approach outlined by Beauchamp and Childress. How parents make ethical decisions is an under-researched area. A possible model for parental decision making is the Ethics of Care (EoC) theory. Ethical decision making within this framework aims to preserve the caring relationship. What is right or wrong depends on the circumstances at the time.Objective: To identify the parental ethical values and determine whether parental decision making is consistent with EoC, a systematic review and secondary analysis of qualitative research from England and Wales, the Netherlands, and Germany was performed. As part of a larger project investigating conflicts between parents and clinicians about children's medical treatment, the choice of countries was determined by differences in litigation.Methods: Eight databases were searched for articles published between 2010 and 2020 reporting on at least one medical treatment decision made by parents of a child with any life-limiting condition and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Twelve included articles directly addressing advance care planning (ACP) were reanalyzed to investigate whether this specific decision parents are increasingly being asked to make is also consistent with EoC.Results: Forty-three articles were included. Parents use the same 6 ethical values which, consistent with EoC, are mostly in the context of their relationship with the child. All values contributed to the previously identified theme of "being a good parent/person." Analysis of parental decision making in ACP confirmed consistency with EoC.Conclusion: The parental decision-making process is consistent with EoC. That parental decisions aim to maintain the caring relationship and are dependent on the circumstances at the time has implications for parental decision making in ACP and should be reflected in future policies.

AB  - Ecosystem services are essential for cities and are key factors in achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such services are best delivered through green infrastructure, which works in resourceful, multifunctional, synergistic, and environmentally sensitive ways to deliver ecosystem services and provide alternative cleaner pathways for the delivery of multiple urban services. It is unclear if current research supports the necessary linkages between ecosystem services, cities, and green infrastructure in order to achieve the SDGs. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review analysing 3392 studies on the SDGs from the WoS database. The contents of 66 of those with relevance to ecosystem services and urban research were reviewed in depth. We applied network-analytic methods to map the relationships of different knowledge clusters of SDGs research (1) across time, (2) across disciplines, and (3) in relation to ecosystem services and cities. The results of our analysis show that research on the SDGs have developed stronger networks from 2010-2018, but this research has not been sustained. Further, whilst research on cities now occupies a central place in the SDGs literature, research on ecosystem services only shows tentative links to both green-infrastructure research and SDGs research. Such literature on urban green infrastructure remains peripheral to the central challenge of sustainable urban transitions. We conclude that when it comes to the SDGs, research articles typically consider urban services independently of green infrastructure. Further, it suggests that green infrastructure is not generally considered as a sustainable alternative to conventional urban infrastructures. To address this serious shortcoming, we recommend transdisciplinary approaches to link urban ecosystem and urban green infrastructure research to the 2030 global sustainability agenda.

AB  - Background: This systematic review will address the need for a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. As the number of dams continues to increase worldwide, so too has concerns for their effects on fish populations. Fish injury and mortality at hydroelectric facilities may have serious consequences for fish populations, which are generally the result of three main sources: (1) fish passage through hydroelectric facilities (i.e., turbines, spillways, sluiceways, and other passage routes) during downstream migration for migratory fish; (2) the entrainment of resident fish; and (3) the impingement of fish (migratory or resident) against screens/trash racks. Most studies on the impacts of entrainment and impingement at hydroelectric facilities on fish have primarily focused on: (1) how fish injury and mortality occurs; and (2) evaluations of the effectiveness of various management strategies used to mitigate harm during downstream passage. Given the contributions of migratory and resident adults and juveniles to fish production, a necessary extension is to evaluate the impacts of fish injury and mortality from hydropower dam entrainment and impingement on fish productivity. Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of fishes dependent on our freshwater ecosystems, a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity is needed.
   Methods: This systematic review will search for, compile, summarize and synthesize evidence on the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. Considered studies will include (but not be limited to): (1) those that report a metric related to mortality and injury as an indication of the effect on fish productivity; (2) the change in a metric related to mortality and injury relative to an appropriate control; and (3) articles that scale-up the evaluation to include some estimate of a change in a component of fish productivity (e.g., articles that include an estimate of fish loss from the population due to entrainment/impingement by comparing a metric related to mortality or injury to an estimate of population size or biomass). Only studies where the causal relationship between intervention and outcome is made clear to allow for the effects of entrainment and impingement to be isolated from other potential impacts of hydroelectric power production (e.g., barriers to migration and/or habitat degradation), will be included. The review will use public search engines and specialist websites, and will include both primary and grey literature. Potential effect modifiers will be identified to obtain a better understanding of the factors that are associated with variation in effects among studies, given differences in: (1) site-specific factors (e.g., turbine type, size, power output); (2) methodologies and study designs used to assess impacts; and (3) biological factors (e.g., fish life history stage, body size and morphology). Study quality will be assessed to allow for critical evaluation, including study design, confounding factors and statistical analysis. Data will be compiled into a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis will be conducted where data availability and quality allow.

AB  - Racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of the diabetes epidemic; they have higher prevalence rates, worse diabetes control, and higher rates of complications. This article reviews the effectiveness of health care interventions at improving health outcomes and/or reducing diabetes health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities with diabetes. Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria. On average, these health care interventions improved the quality of care for racial/ethnic minorities, improved health outcomes (such as diabetes control and reduced diabetes complications), and possibly reduced health disparities in quality of care. There is evidence supporting the use of interventions that target patients (primarily through culturally tailored programs), providers (especially through one-on-one feedback and education), and health systems (particularly with nurse case managers and nurse clinicians). More research is needed in the areas of racial/ethnic minorities other than African Americans and Latinos, health disparity reductions, long-term diabetes-related outcomes, and the sustainability of health care interventions over time.

AB  - Renewable electricity generation from solar energy has rapidly increased in South Asia. This paper presents a systematic review of 79 scholarly papers on the topic of solar home system adoption, energy consumption, and social practices in South Asia. Using an intersectionality lens, the paper demonstrates that various categories of difference, such as gender, age, class, and ethnicity, intersect and shape the adoption of this technology in South Asia. Utilizing a social practice theory lens, the paper shows that solar home systems shape the spatial and temporal arrangements and practices of members of households that have adopted the technology, as well as their counterparts who have not. This technology has a practical but also symbolic function; the symbolic function and social meaning are derived from the economic and socio-cultural contexts. As this renewable energy technology is embedded in economic and socio-cultural contexts, people reconfigure it in creative ways to meet their everyday energy needs. The paper identifies research gaps and suggests future research agendas.

AB  - Mineral exploitation is an important activity and, due to its complexity, presents many issues related to environmental, economical and social aspects. The presence of heavy metals over the process is one of the most concerning problems to the environment and health. The releasing of residues containing such elements can be minimized properly with the use of new technologies. This study focuses on the application of electrospinning technology in order to produce nanoscaled structures, based on a systematic literature review. The use of this technique allows the production of very innovative materials, based on poly(acrylonitrile) or chitosan, for example. They act as adsorbent for heavy metals in wastewater treatment. Some of the advantages are related to the high specific surface area and the ability to modify the matrix structure, by functionalization or adding specific materials. In conclusion, it is possible to confirm its potential application in the mining industry, as a tertiary process on the wastewater treatment to remove diverse heavy metals.

AB  - The world is witnessing an exponential growth in electric vehicle stock and registration and there will be millions of electric vehicles on road by 2030. This increase in electric vehicles (EVs) would lead to increase the bulk of e-waste generated through the end-of-life (EoL) lithium ion batteries. This paper covers various aspect related to EV battery waste related to the present status of research in form of bibliometric survey, increase in EV numbers - statistics, effect of EV battery waste on soil, groundwater and effect of recycling Li-ion batteries on environment and human health. The study indicates that there is a need for the development of sustainable battery chemistry from an environmental perspective. The systematic review indicates a need for research in the area of developing sustainable waste management and recycling technique for EoL lithium-ion batteries from the perspective of soil, groundwater contamination, and human health impact.

AB  - Different cultures show different understandings of consciousness, soul, and spirit. Native indigenous traditions have recently seen a resurgence of interest and are being used in psychotherapy, mental health counselling, and psychiatry. The main aim of this review is to explore and summarize the native indigenous concepts of consciousness, soul, and spirit. Following a systematic review search, the peer-reviewed literature presenting research from 55 different cultural groups across regions of the world was retrieved. Information relating to native concepts of consciousness, soul, and spirit were excerpted from the sources and contrasted. Contrasting these indigenous concepts revealed important implications for understanding consciousness within a cross-cultural perspective and has practical implications for applied approaches utilizing native indigenous traditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
LA  - English
AB  - Materials research relating to bio-based polymers and composites has become the order of the day and several types of research are being undertaken on these materials. This is mainly due to the belief in the ability of these polymers and composites to serve as potential alternatives for synthetic polymers and fiber-reinforced composites and to mitigate problems pertaining to environmental pollution. A majority of synthetic fibers and polymers in the market today are developed from nonrenewable petroleum-based materials. These have the potential to harm the natural biodiversity of the environment. On the other hand, the use of bioplastics and biocomposites is supported by a few facts such as low cost, lesser energy consumption during production, and notable mechanical and thermal characteristics. The usage of bio-based fibers and polymers in the manufacture of biocomposites in numerous applications greatly enhance the sustainability by eradicating the problem of waste generation. Considering all the above points, the current review focuses on the synthesis and characterization of bioplastics and biocomposites. An elaborate discussion on the mechanical and thermal properties of these materials has also been made. In addition, this review comprehensively discusses the applications, challenges, and prospects of bioplastics and biocomposites.

AB  - Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a decision support approach which is applied in various shapes and forms throughout the world. In England, amongst a range of areas of application, HIA is applied in local (spatial) plan making and project development planning. Whilst various authors have reflected on HIA practice in England, the extent of application and its quality has remained unclear. This paper aims at addressing this gap by reporting on the results of a systematic review of HIA in planning. It is found that between 100 and 200 HIAs are likely being produced each year in England. Whilst most assessments are rapid (desk based), there are also examples of comprehensive and intermediate HIAs, where a participatory procedural approach is followed. An important finding is that those HIAs applied within the context of other assessments (integrated impact assessment -IIA, strategic environmental assessment - SEA/ sustainability appraisal -SA and environmental impact assessment - EIA) tend to be of a higher quality than standalone HIAs, mainly because of the existing comprehensive statutory procedural requirements for these other assessments into which HIA can be integrated.

AB  - In the last decades, natural fire regimes have experienced significant alterations in terms of intensity, frequency and severity in fire prone regions of the world. Modelling forest fire susceptibility has been essential in identifying areas of high risk to minimize threats to natural resources, biodiversity and life. There have been significant improvements in forest fire susceptibility modelling over the past two decades 2001-2021. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review of literature covering forest fire susceptibility modelling published during this period. The review provides insights on the main themes of forest fire susceptibility modelling research, the main base input factors used in models to map forest fire susceptibility, the main researchers, the areas where this type of research were implemented, technology and models used. It also highlights collaboration opportunities, and regions, such as Central America and Africa, where mapping of forest fire susceptibility is needed. We argue that such knowledge is crucial in order to identify critical factors and opportunities which can aid in improving factor selection and forest fire management.

AB  - Context: Surgical activity contributes to global warming though the production of greenhouse gases and consumption of resources. To date, no clinical practice guidelines have been made to promote and implement climate-smart actions. Objective: To perform a systematic review of the available actions that could limit CO2 emission in the operating room (OR) and their potential benefits upon the environment, whilst preserving quality of care. Evidence acquisition: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from January 1, 1990 to April 2021. We included studies assessing carbon footprint (CF) in the OR and articles detailing actions that limit or reduce CF. Evidence synthesis: Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. We identified six core climate-smart actions: (1) waste reduction by segregation; (2) waste reduction by recy-cling, reuse, and reprocessing; (3) sterilisation; (4) anaesthesia gas management; and (5) improvement of energy use. Quantitative analysis regarding the CF was not possible due to the lack of homogeneous data. For climate-smart actions, the analysis was limited by discrepancies in study scope and in the methodology of CO2 emission calculation. Improvement of education and awareness was found to have an important impact on waste segregation and reduction. Waste management is the area where health care workers could have the strongest impact, whereas the main field to reduce CF in the OR was found to be energy consumption. Conclusions: This review provides arguments for many climate-smart actions that could be implemented in our daily practice. Improving awareness and education are important to act collectively in a sustainable way. Further studies are mandatory to assess the impact of these climate-smart actions in the OR. Patient summary: We performed a systematic review of the available scientific literature to reference all the climate-smart actions proposed to improve the sustainability of surgical activities. Waste segregation, waste reduction and recycling, reuse and repro-cessing, sterilisation, anaesthesia gas changes, and improvement of energy use in the operating room were found to be the main areas of research. There is still a long way to go to homogenise and improve the quality of our climate-smart actions. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

AB  - Natural systems are declining at an unparalleled rate. To prompt conservation of ecosystems, the IUCN has developed a framework to assess ecosystem threat. By 2025, the IUCN aims to assess the collapse risk of all the world's ecosystems using this framework. This increases the pressure to refine tractable methods to predict collapse. However, there has been no systematic review of whether predicting collapse is possible and practical, which is impeding consistent and comparable assessments of ecosystem threat. Here, we conduct such a review and highlight six areas of concern - stemming from the findings of our review in need of immediate attention to progress work on assessing ecosystem collapse and the application of such assessments to the management of at-risk ecosystems. These are: (1) better conceptualizations of ecosystems, (2) better conceptualizations of ecosystem collapse, (3) improved integration of theory, experimentation, and practice, (4) improved surrogates and early warning indicators of ecosystem collapse, (5) the implementation of management experiments to enhance understanding of ecosystem stability, and (6) ensuring IUCN Red List of Ecosystems listings result in the conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Current clinical assessment and imaging techniques were described in part 1, and this article presents a systematic review of the surgical treatment principles in the management of midface and internal orbit fractures from initial care to definitive treatment, including illustrative case examples. New developments enabled limited surgical approaches by standardization of osteosynthesis principles regarding three-dimensional buttress reconstruction, by newly developed individualized implants such as titanium meshes and, especially for complex fracture patterns, by critical assessment of anatomical reconstruction through intraoperative endoscopy, as well as intra- and postoperative imaging. Resorbable soft tissue anchors can be used both for ligament and soft tissue resuspension to reduce ptosis effects in the cheeks and nasolabial area and to achieve facial aesthetics similar to those prior to the injury.

AB  - Predation pressure on vulnerable bird species has made predator control an important issue for international nature conservation. Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation.

In this paper we conduct a rapid review of the literature on MaaS and, using Moovit as a case study, we explore the association between the popularity of searches in Google using the term "Moovit" and the share of workers that commute by public transport. The exercise focuses on metropolitan areas in the United States over the period 2010 to 2019. We find a positive correlation, and we speculate that metropolitan areas with pre-existing higher shares of workers commuting by public transport tend to be metropolitan areas where use of Moovit is more likely.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to support sustainable and resilient urban planning. However, design and planning urban NBS targeted at the needs of the local context require knowledge about the causal relationships between NBS, ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC) This paper aims at contributing to this knowledge, by systematically identifying nexuses (i.e. qualitative links) between UC, ES and NBS, and describing plausible causal relationships. A conceptual UC-ES-NBS criteria framework was built, and used to guide a two-step systematic literature review on current UC and on the supply of ES by urban NBS. This was followed by a non-systematic literature review, which complemented the previous one by unveiling knowledge gaps on the biophysical and social processes and attributes on which specific ES classes depend. The non-systematic review was also used to identify additional NBS. The UC review identified 18 UC and 58 sub-challenges, and illustrated which UC were more studied, according to the type of literature and environmental and socio-economic attributes of urban contexts. The ES review led to the development of an urban NBS classification, and supported the identification of UC-ES and ES-NBS nexuses, which were analysed and classified into four groups of causal relationship. For the nexuses identified as direct plausible causal relationship, the main processes and attributes on which the supply of specific ES depend were pointed out. Relationships between UC, ES, NBS, processes, and attributes were represented in the form of network diagrams. Our results can be used to support urban policies aimed at mainstreaming NBS and as a basis to further understand UC-ES-NBS relationships.

AB  - Green lean six sigma (GLSS) is an emerging approach towards environmental sustainability in conjunction with operational achievements. The success of this approach is premised on an understanding of the different components of a GLSS program; being the determinants for its outcomes. The aim of this paper is to investigate the various constructs of GLSS that play an essential role in achieving environmental sustainability. For this purpose, a systematic review of available literature has been conducted to evaluate the drivers, enablers (tools), and outcomes of a GLSS strategy as well as its critical success factors and barriers. Findings reveal that these constructs of GLSS as a holistic approach can facilitate an organization to better accomplish environmental objectives such as waste minimization, emission reduction, and resource conservation as compared to constructs of only one or any two of these strategies. Based on the analysis, an integrated GLSS framework is developed for environmental sustainability in addition to identifying vital research gaps and future directions.

AB  - Fairs and markets are places that play a considerable role for cities in the economic, social and cultural sphere, contributing to the dynamics of local and regional trade and urban development. In this perspective, the objective of the article was to analyze the scientific production relevant to the dynamics that prevail in the midst of these spaces, identifying the main aspects that are being discussed on issues of governance, organization and infrastructure in these spaces. For that, a systematic review was carried out in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Scielo, Portal de periodic capes; and in the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD), covering the period from 1990 to 2021. The identified quantity was 30 articles and 10 master's dissertations. Among the dimensions addressed, issues of governance and organization of fairs and markets stood out. Placing itself in evidence that in these places the activities go beyond economic relations, being spaces of sociability. Other points under discussion refer to the application of public policies and the lack of organizational projection of management in these spaces, linked to the lack of infrastructure, mainly to these two dimensions. It is concluded that for the functioning of these places, it is essential that these three dimensions work together, being necessary and fundamental the deepening of research, to know the problems and the socioeconomic potential of these places, seeking more information for the planning, elaboration of actions and programs aimed at these spaces, in order to aim at promoting local capital, strengthening the popular economy and meeting the basic needs of the population.

AB  - We present a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles, empirical as well as conceptual, investigating the integration of big data analytics in e-governance within business management, decision sciences, social sciences, and policy literature. Our primary objective in undertaking this review is to better understand the competing and conflicting scholarly perspectives on the integration of big data analytics in the delivery of governance, public services, and evidence-based policymaking. We focus particularly on a critical assessment of the literature to identify visible as well as less perceptible gaps in extant research to set a comprehensive future research agenda. In addition, we also aim to dig deeper into the landscape of the available research in terms of the volume of scientific production and other bibliometric characteristics to gauge the extent and nature of scholarly engagement with the area to inform future research. To these ends, we executed our systematic review through a four-step process of scoping, specification and execution of search protocols, short-listing of congruent literature, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis. In all, we identified 45 articles that attended to big data analytics and e-governance as the core concerns or themes. Our analysis generated four pillars on which the academic contributions in the area rest: actors, opportunities, tensions, and applications. We critically synthesized the findings around these four pillars to map the gaps and develop potential research questions that future researchers can address to expand the evidence and insights in the area to influence policy and governance.

AB  - Soundscape ecology is a promising area that studies landscape patterns based on their acoustic composition. It focuses on the distribution of biotic and abiotic sounds at different frequencies of the landscape acoustic attribute and the relationship of said sounds with ecosystem health metrics and indicators (e.g., species richness, acoustic biodiversity, vectors of structural change, gradients of vegetation cover, landscape connectivity, and temporal and spatial characteristics). To conduct such studies, researchers analyze recordings from Acoustic Recording Units (ARUs). The increasing use of ARUs and their capacity to record hours of audio for months at a time have created a need for automatic processing methods to reduce time consumption, correlate variables implicit in the recordings, extract features, and characterize sound patterns related to landscape attributes. Consequently, traditional machine learning methods have been commonly used to process data on different characteristics of soundscapes, mainly the presence-absence of species. In addition, it has been employed for call segmentation, species identification, and sound source clustering. However, some authors highlight the importance of the new approaches that use unsupervised deep learning methods to improve the results and diversify the assessed attributes. In this paper, we present a systematic review of machine learning methods used in the field of ecoacoustics for data processing. It includes recent trends, such as semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning methods. Moreover, it maintains the format found in the reviewed papers. First, we describe the ARUs employed in the papers analyzed, their configuration, and the study sites where the datasets were collected. Then, we provide an ecological justification that relates acoustic monitoring to landscape features. Subsequently, we explain the machine learning methods followed to assess various landscape attributes. The results show a trend towards labelfree methods that can process the large volumes of data gathered in recent years. Finally, we discuss the need to adopt methods with a machine learning approach in other biological dimensions of landscapes.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION What is the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women who received any of the COVID-19 vaccines? SUMMARY ANSWER There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mass roll-out of vaccines helped to boost herd immunity and reduced hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality. Still, many were concerned about the safety of vaccines for pregnancy, which may have limited their uptake among pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception until June 2022 using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS We included observational and interventional studies that enrolled pregnant women and evaluated any of the available COVID-19 vaccines compared to placebo or no vaccination. We primarily reported on miscarriage in addition to ongoing pregnancy and/or live birth. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE We included data from 21 studies (5 randomized trials and 16 observational studies) reporting on 149 685 women. The pooled rate of miscarriage among women who received a COVID-19 vaccine was 9% (n = 14 749/123 185, 95% CI 0.05-0.14). Compared to those who received a placebo or no vaccination, women who received a COVID-19 vaccine did not have a higher risk of miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.28, I-2 35.8%) and had comparable rates for ongoing pregnancy or live birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03, I-2 10.72%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Our analysis was limited to observational evidence with varied reporting, high heterogeneity and risk of bias across included studies, which may limit the generalizability and confidence in our findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with an increase in the risk of miscarriage or reduced rates of ongoing pregnancy or live birth among women of reproductive age. The current evidence remains limited and larger population studies are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.

AB  - Understanding which factors influence urban metabolism is a prerequisite for designing policies and plans that effectuate sustainable resource management. A growing number of publications is concerned with these factors. Yet, this emerging field of research lacks a common framework that supports researchers in interpreting their findings, such as generalizability to other cities, and making informed decisions on their research design. Aiming to contribute to building such a framework, we systematically reviewed urban metabolism literature. This review paper presents an overview of factors influencing urban water and energy consumption and their effect on consumption, and it describes the interconnectedness of these factors for six different types of relationships. Results disclose fourteen drivers, changes in societal context that shape consumption patterns, and twenty-one facilitators/constraints. The latter type of factors include consumer, resource and urban landscape characteristics that affect resource consumption by facilitating or constraining specific activities. Findings indicate commonalities between primary studies in terms of prevalent observed effect direction for a given factor. However, the interconnections between different factors can influence the direction and magnitude of effects and thereby result in case-specific variability in consumption patterns. Future research should enhance the understanding of these interconnections, strengthen the evidence for the factors presented here and provide insight in additional factors of influence. It is essential to align these studies in terms of a common terminology, transparent quality assessment and a unified approach to measuring and expressing factors of influence. Connecting with related disciplines working on a common systems approach is key to realize the full potential of urban metabolism research to advance our understanding of cities.

This paper provides a systematic review of LML-related studies to find current issues and future opportunities for the LML service industry. To that end, 169 works were selected as target studies for in-depth analysis of recent LML advances. First, text mining analysis was performed to effectively understand the underlying LML themes in the target studies. Then, the novel definition and typology of LML delivery services were suggested. Finally, this paper proposed the next generation of LML research through advanced delivery technique-based LML services, environmentally sustainable LML systems, improvement of LML operations in real industries, effective management of uncertainties in LML, and LML delivery services for decentralized manufacturing services. We believe that this systematic literature review can serve as a useful tool for LML decision makers and stakeholders.

AB  - Windbreaks are key structural elements in the rural environment and affect the functionality of landscapes in multiple ways. A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to under informed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of ES scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported. The present review reveals an intense need for further interdisciplinary research using indicators, ES approaches or similar instruments that enable quantitative and comparable statements about the functionality of windbreaks in rural landscapes.

AB  - Introduction: meaningful community engagement is increasingly being considered the major determinant of successful research, innovation and intervention uptake. Even though there is available literature recommending community engagement in health research, there are still knowledge gaps in how communities might be best engaged in Sub-Saharan Africa. We, therefore, synthesized the existing literature on the current practices, barriers and facilitators, ethical considerations, and gender mainstreaming in the engagement of communities in research in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: this synthesis was developed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta -Analysis (PRISMA). A combination of keywords and medical subject headings was used to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health Library through OVID SP, the Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, CINAHL, WHO Afro Library, WHO Global Index Medicus and the National Institute for Health Research, for all literature published between 1 January 2000 to 31 July 2021. Results: thirty articles met our inclusion criteria. The key reported facilitators of effective community engagement in research included appropriate community entry and engagement of stakeholders. Barriers to effective community engagement in research included the availability of prohibitive cultural, historical and religious practices; geographical/spatial limitations, difficulties in planning and executing community engagement activities and communication barriers. Awareness creation and sensitization on the research through drama, social media, documentaries, and community durbars are some of the existing practices adopted in engaging communities in research. Gender mainstreaming was not considered appropriately in the engagement of communities in research, as only a few studies made provisions for gender considerations, and most of the time, interchanging gender for sex. Respect for autonomy, privacy and informed consent were the main ethical issues reported. Conclusion: gender mainstreaming and ethical standards were reported as important, but not explored in depth. Gender as a social construct needs to be carefully integrated in the entire research cycle. Clear ethical concerns within a research project have to be co-discussed by the research team, community members and potential research participants.

AB  - Although personal value orientation has received the attention of scholars to explain and predict various consumer behaviors, prior research within the hospitality and tourism context has proposed the mismatched fundamental concept and operationalization of personal values and/or has adapted partial aspects of the personal value construct, such as pro-environmental behaviors. Based on the fundamental principles of personal value orientation, this study systematically reviewed studies that focused on personal value orientation by investigating their research context, definitions, theoretical background and measurements, roles and main results. The systematic literature review was conducted with articles published in top-tier hospitality and tourism journals between 2000 and 2018 by identifying research gaps and providing a direction for future research on personal value orientation in those fields.

AB  - Sustainability communication in tourism is an emerging research topic. In acknowledgement of tourism researchers' and practitioners' need to gain a better theoretical and practical understanding of effective sustainability communication, this article provides the first literature review to identify what is known of the subject and what needs further study. This systematic review indicates that extant research has focused on the marketing of green hotels and environmental sustainability. Little is understood about personal communication channels and message factors that lead to positive consumer reactions. These are major explanations why sustainability messages have not been as effective as they could be. Furthermore, there is a lack of theoretical foundation with regard to information processing and effective message design, and of experiments and interpretivist/qualitative approaches to support such research. Recommendations on future research are provided to broaden theoretical perspectives and support practitioner solutions by a more holistic approach to sustainability communication.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted various aspects of society, and research has been published across different sectors beyond healthcare. This article presents the results of a (HSCM) to identify current and future research areas. The literature review identified four main research themes associated with the scope of HSCM, the flow type, and the approaches employed. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 is a catalyst for short- and long-term changes that require the attention of researchers, strategies to incorporate 4.0 technologies, and integration of different stakeholders to improve the resilience and sustainability of the Supply Chain (SC) in future pandemic scenarios. This paper provides relevant information to the implementation for future research regarding the management of the HSCM for the post-pandemic period.

AB  - Background: Improvement initiatives offer a valuable mechanism for delivering and testing innovations in healthcare settings. Many of these initiatives deliver meaningful and necessary changes to patient care and outcomes. However, many improvement initiatives fail to sustain to a point where their full benefits can be realised. This has led many researchers and healthcare practitioners to develop frameworks, models and tools to support and monitor sustainability. This work aimed to identify what approaches are available to assess and influence sustainability in healthcare and to describe the different perspectives, applications and constructs within these approaches to guide their future use.
   Methods: A systematic review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines to identify publications that reported approaches to support or influence sustainability in healthcare. Eligibility criteria were defined through an iterative process in which two reviewers independently assessed 20% of articles to test the objectivity of the selection criteria. Data were extracted from the identified articles, and a template analysis was undertaken to identify and assess the sustainability constructs within each reported approach.
   Results: The search strategy identified 1748 publications with 227 articles retrieved in full text for full documentary analysis. In total, 62 publications identifying a sustainability approach were included in this review (32 frameworks, 16 models, 8 tools, 4 strategies, 1 checklist and 1 process). Constructs across approaches were compared and 40 individual constructs for sustainability were found. Comparison across approaches demonstrated consistent constructs were seen regardless of proposed interventions, setting or level of application with 6 constructs included in 75% of the approaches. Although similarities were found, no approaches contained the same combination of the constructs nor did any single approach capture all identified constructs. From these results, a consolidated framework for sustainability constructs in healthcare was developed.
   Conclusions: Choosing a sustainability method can pose a challenge because of the diverse approaches reported in the literature. This review provides a valuable resource to researchers, healthcare professionals and improvement practitioners by providing a summary of available sustainability approaches and their characteristics.

AB  - Background. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of vision loss in diabetics that is currently mainly treated by antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. The effect of these agents on macular perfusion (MP) is a current concern. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an imaging modality that allows noninvasive high-resolution retinal microvasculature imaging. Several recent studies evaluated the effect of anti-VEGF agents on the MP of DME patients using OCTA. Our aim is to provide a systematic review of these studies. Methods. Multiple databases were searched including PubMed, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for relevant studies published between January 2016 and November 2020 which were included in this review. Studies were compared regarding their design, the number of included patients, the machine and scanning protocol used, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of injections given, the type of anti-VEGF agent used, the outcome measures assessed, and the effect of injections on different MP parameters. Results. A total of 16 studies were included. The studies assessed various OCTA parameters that define MP including the foveal avascular zone area and superficial and deep vascular density and yielded conflicting results. Seven studies showed stable or improved MP following treatment, while 7 studies showed worsening MP following treatment, and 2 studies showed inconclusive results. This could have been due to differences in study design, inclusion criteria, type of anti-VEGF agents used, treatment duration, and methods of image analysis and vascular density quantification. All identified studies were noncomparative case series, and 14 of them (87.5%) used the RTVue XR Avanti OCTA machine. Only one study compared OCTA to fluorescein angiography findings. Conclusion. Analysis of MP changes following VEGF inhibition for DME could benefit from a unified scanning protocol and analysis approach that uses similar study designs to eliminate potential sources of bias. This may provide more definitive conclusions regarding the effect of treatment on MP.

AB  - Soils harbour highly-diverse invertebrate communities that play important roles for ecosystem services, including the mitigation of environmental pollution. Chemical stressors, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and metals, are being increasingly spread into ecosystems due to human activities. While it is crucial to predict the consequences of chemical stressors for soil biodiversity, chemical toxicity is often assessed using individuals or populations in laboratory cultures. There has been no systematic evaluation of the evidence documenting the impacts of chemical stressors on diverse, natural soil communities. Here, we use a comprehensive literature review of 274 studies to evaluate the current state of knowledge about the effects of chemicals on soil fauna communities. Most research has had limited spatial scope, with noteworthy gaps in the regions that are potentially the most threatened by soil pollution (Southern Hemisphere). Furthermore, reports generally were constrained to a few emblematic soil fauna groups (nematodes, collembola and earthworms) and chemical stressors (metals). Future research should address biases in spatial distribution of studies, as well as the taxonomic groups and chemical compounds considered. Specifically, emphasis on indirect effects mediated by species interactions, ecosystem functioning and interactive effects of stressors and climate change, currently lacking in the literature, is needed to improve soil-biodiversity conservation and restoration efforts, as well as predictions of global diversity change.

AB  - Engaging the community in Early Warning Systems (EWSs) plays an essential role in saving lives, reducing injuries, and limiting environmental damage associated with disaster events.
   However, EWSs have traditionally focused on technology and infrastructure with the absence of comprehensive engagement with the community across the four EWS elements of risk knowledge, monitoring, dissemination and communication and response capability. Subsequently, past experience shows inappropriate responses by communities during disasters.
   This study reviews definitions, concepts and evolution of EWSs, and the applicability of Community Engagement (CE) in EWSs. It aims to systematically review how the community is engaged in the four elements of EWSs using evidence from the literature sourced from peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. From a total of 4211 initial documents sourced from 2008 to 2018, 31 documents (15 peer-reviewed journal articles and 16 grey literature from project reports) were finally selected to review after an extensive screening process. Of the 31 documents, most of them were from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) especially the Asian region, followed by the African region.
   The findings indicate inadequate CE across the four EWS elements (dominating in the risk knowledge element with a single hazard focus). Identified key issues included challenges for sustainability of CE in EWSs, inadequate integration of local and scientific knowledge into EWS design and operation and insufficient consideration of the full range of vulnerable groups in the system. More systematic and sustained efforts are required to improve CE in all EWS elements in order to achieve more effective disaster response.

AB  - Introduction Trauma is widespread in Central and South America and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Providing high quality emergency trauma care is of great importance. Understanding the barriers to care is challenging; this systematic review aims to establish current the current challenges and barriers in providing high-quality trauma care within the 21 countries in the region. Methods OVID Medline, Embase, EBM reviews and Global Health databases were systematically searched in October 2020. Records were screened by two independent researchers. Data were extracted according to a predetermined proforma. Studies of any type, published in the preceding decade were included, excluding grey literature and non-English records. Trauma was defined as blunt or penetrating injury from an external force. Studies were individually critically appraised and assessed for bias using the RTI item bank. Results 57 records met the inclusion criteria. 20 countries were covered at least once. Nine key barriers were identified: training (37/57), resources and equipment (33/57), protocols (29/57), staffing (17/57), transport and logistics (16/57), finance (15/57), socio-cultural (13/57), capacity (9/57), public education (4/57). Conclusion Nine key barriers negatively impact on the provision of high-quality trauma care and highlight potential areas for improving care in Central & South America. Many countries in the region, along with rural areas, are under-represented by the current literature and future research is urgently required to assess barriers to trauma management in these countries. No funding was received. Clinical Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020220380.

AB  - ObjectiveTo identify barriers and facilitators associated with the sustainability of implemented and evaluated improvement programs in healthcare delivery systems.Data sources and study settingSix academic databases were searched to identify relevant peer-reviewed journal articles published in English between July 2011 and June 2022. Studies were included if they reported on healthcare program sustainability and explicitly identified barriers to, and facilitators of, sustainability.Study designA systematic integrative review guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Study quality was appraised using Hawker's Quality Assessment Tool.Data collection/extraction methodsA team of reviewers screened eligible studies against the inclusion criteria and extracted the data independently using a purpose-designed Excel spreadsheet. Barriers and facilitators were extracted and mapped to the Integrated Sustainability Framework (ISF). Frequency counts of reported barriers/facilitators were performed across the included studies.ResultsOf the 124 studies included in this review, almost half utilised qualitative designs (n = 52; 41.9%) and roughly one third were conducted in the USA (n = 43; 34.7%). Few studies (n = 29; 23.4%) reported on program sustainability beyond 5 years of program implementation and only 16 of them (55.2%) defined sustainability. Factors related to the ISF categories of inner setting (n = 99; 79.8%), process (n = 99; 79.8%) and intervention characteristics (n = 72; 58.1%) were most frequently reported. Leadership/support (n = 61; 49.2%), training/support/supervision (n = 54; 43.5%) and staffing/turnover (n = 50; 40.3%) were commonly identified barriers or facilitators of sustainability across included studies. Forty-six (37.1%) studies reported on the outer setting category: funding (n = 26; 56.5%), external leadership by stakeholders (n = 16; 34.8%), and socio-political context (n = 14; 30.4%). Eight studies (6.5%) reported on discontinued programs, with factors including funding and resourcing, poor fit, limited planning, and intervention complexity contributing to discontinuation.ConclusionsThis review highlights the importance of taking into consideration the inner setting, processes, intervention characteristics and outer setting factors when sustaining healthcare programs, and the need for long-term program evaluations. There is a need to apply consistent definitions and implementation frameworks across studies to strengthen evidence in this area.Trial registrationhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/11/e018568.

AB  - In this study we aimed to identify the construction of meanings of Social Business in studies related to the theme. This is a systematic review of the literature supported by the production available on the Web of Science database from January 2015 to December 2020. The survey identified 460 articles. The material analysis process resulted in a set of 80 articles that were strictly related to the research objective. The analysis of the productions made it possible to classify the theme into 11 subcategories. The data found make it possible to infer that the construct of the meanings of social business is based on themes in the area, such as management, innovation, business model and impact, presenting modest interfaces with the economic and environmental aspects, common to the concept of sustainability. It was also evident that the scientific production on Social Business has received greater influence from the American approach.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem services (ES) are vulnerable to land use and land cover changes (LULCC). These changes are triggered by different drivers of change (e.g., economic, social, political, environmental - climate change). Understanding the potential future LULCC is an effective way to anticipate the impacts on ES supply. In recent years, some researchers applied different spatial modelling methods to assess the potential LULCC future impacts on ES supply, but so far, no systematic review was carried out. This work aims to do a bibliographic review about future LULCC and their implications on ES supply (provisioning, regulating, and cultural services). After a rigorous bibliographic review, we identified 957 papers. However, only 79 papers meet the criteria to be used in the review. The results showed that (i) the studies have been mainly focused on Asia (55.70%) and Europe (17,72%); (ii) the most common and extensively used models to project future LULCC were cellular automata (30.86%), CLUE-S model (8.64%) and Land Change Modeler (8.64%); and (iii) the most used methods to assess future impacts on ES were the InVEST model (24.04%), and equations used in previous works (12.5%). These studies were mainly focused on measuring future impacts on provisioning (44.11%) and regulating services (43.59%). Also, most of the works lack external validation. The diversity of studies evaluated allowed to recognise gaps and outline insights into the current scientific research on this scientific domain, representing an essential contribution to the current state of knowledge by supporting both practitioners and scientists.

AB  - Bottom-contact fishing gears are globally the most widespread anthropogenic sources of direct disturbance to the seabed and associated biota. Managing these fishing disturbances requires quantification of gear impacts on biota and the rate of recovery following disturbance. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 122 experiments on the effects-of-bottom fishing to quantify the removal of benthos in the path of the fishing gear and to estimate rates of recovery following disturbance. A gear pass reduced benthic invertebrate abundance by 26% and species richness by 19%. The effect was strongly gear-specific, with gears that penetrate deeper into the sediment having a significantly larger impact than those that penetrate less. Sediment composition (% mud and presence of biogenic habitat) and the history of fishing disturbance prior to an experimental fishing event were also important predictors of depletion, with communities in areas that were not previously fished, predominantly muddy or biogenic habitats being more strongly affected by fishing. Sessile and low mobility biota with longer life-spans such as sponges, soft corals and bivalves took much longer to recover after fishing (>3 year) than mobile biota with shorter life-spans such as polychaetes and malacostracans (<1 year). This meta-analysis provides insights into the dynamics of recovery. Our estimates of depletion along with estimates of recovery rates and large-scale, high-resolution maps of fishing frequency and habitat will support more rigorous assessment of the environmental impacts of bottom-contact gears, thus supporting better informed choices in trade-offs between environmental impacts and fish production.

AB  - A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the relation between key players of the demand for sport and the environmental sustainability, within the 2013-2019 timeframe. Data were collected from four scientific databases and scrutinized by the PRISMA protocol. Quantitative systematic literature review and content analysis, supported by Nvivo 11 and EndNote X7 software, were the methodologies used for data analysis. The results provided by the 142 selected studies highlighted tourism and recreation as the most scrutinized areas by recent research on this relationship. Compared to spectators and local residents, the nature-based sport practitioners were the furthest analysed type of sport consumers. The most pursued research objective relates to the behavioural driving factors. Among the environmental action's encouraging causes, psychological factors were emphasized. Promoting the sport consumer's environmental education, along with the improvement of the environmental communication developed by the organizations integrating the sport offer, were the greatest management recommendations to induce ecological behavioural change. Future studies should focus on deepening the knowledge on the spectators' and local residents' relation with environmental sustainability, namely through the comparison of practitioners and non-practitioners, so that sport can assert itself more effectively in the implementation of environmental sustainability.

AB  - The concept of energy justice (EJ) has gained importance in discussions about energy transitions, mainly due to a growing number of researchers working on the social implications of greenhouse gas emission reductions. At the moment, EJ is defined as a framework for discussing fairness in energy systems and operates as an umbrella term to signify various concerns related to energy development across diverse groups to enable communication. Thus, we call EJ a boundary object (BO) and discuss its further evolution into a standard, or its dissolution into several locally specific concepts. This study provides a systematic review of the literature that applies the concept of EJ: how its features developed and how it gained popularity in academic publications to mid-2019. We present a bibliometric overview of the number of occurrences of the concept across the literature using the Scopus and WOS databases (N = 182) and, using VOSviewer software, we describe similarities between research topics to which the concept was related. By mapping out its diverse thematic and geographic applications, we review the critical trends and claim that EJ can address real-life challenges. We submit that it will have more practical power once it starts being used more broadly to build cooperation among scholars, policymakers, activists, and grassroots movements.

AB  - Indirect interactions occur when the effect of one species on another is mediated by a third species. These interactions occur in most multi-species assemblages and are diverse in their mechanistic pathways. The interest in indirect interactions has increased exponentially over the past three decades, in recognition of their importance in determining plant community dynamics and promoting species coexistence. Here, we review the literature on indirect interactions among plants published since 1990, using a novel synthetic framework that accounts for and classifies intervening species and mechanisms within trophic networks. The objectives of this review are: (1) to identify the geographical regions and ecosystem types where indirect interactions have been examined; (2) to summarize the information on the number of trophic levels examined in studies of indirect interactions; (3) to test whether the frequency of indirect interactions varies across environmental gradients; and (4) to identify the experimental approaches most commonly used in studies of indirect interactions. Studies examining indirect interactions in plants have been conducted primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, with a focus on grasslands and forests. The majority of studies (67%) examined two trophic levels. Indirect facilitation and apparent competition are the interactions that have been most frequently examined, with the latter being reported more frequently in relatively productive environments. Other indirect interactions reported include associational resistance, exploitative competition or facilitation, shared defenses, and trophic cascades. Generally, field experiments tested indirect interactions based on single target species. While the majority of studies on indirect interactions dealt with basic ecology issues, several studies have dealt with such interactions in the context of biological invasions (18%) and rangeland management (12%). This review allowed us identifying a number of research needs, including the study of non-feeding interactions and that for more realistic complex designs, explicitly testing indirect interactions across different trophic levels, in geographical regions that have been under-examined to date, and in stressful ecosystems.

AB  - Cities, in continuous growth, are at a critical moment to guarantee economic, social and environmental stability, as recognised by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This study aims to demonstrate how Green Infrastructure (GI) can contribute, as spaces of opportunity in cities, to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in metropolitan areas. And by doing that, more substantial support from urban planners and decision-makers may be performed. A systematic literature review based on the PRISMA method was conducted, 694 records were identified, and 100 articles were thoroughly reviewed. The main finding suggested that 17 SDGs and 74 (44%) of its 169 targets may be achieved through a single strategy; the implementation of nature in the city and the use of the ecosystem services that the environment provides to its advantage. The analysis shows the need for a system change in urban areas worldwide, where GI can contribute to 80% of the targets in SDG11, "Sustainable Cities and Society." The metropolis remains the most efficient area to test and implement green solutions to have an immediate impact on achieving the SDGs. It is imperative to take climate action, and GI can be used as an urban catalyst for sustainability and, consequently, resilience in contemporary cities.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between translocality and transportation in developing countries from the perspective of sustainable development. Using sub-Saharan Africa as a case study and relying on secondary data, the study established that migration is directly and significantly dependent on transportation. In addition, the paper observed that transportation drives migration, influences the pattern of mobility and livelihoods of trans-local migrants. The link between transportation and migration has a profound impact on the achievement of the sustainable development goals. The paper recommends pragmatic policies and re-investment in transportation in both rural and urban areas to enhance effective and efficient mobility for socio-economic development.

AB  - Research into traditional ecological knowledge has become a reference in environmental management. This is followed by ecological wisdom that has emerged and has become a new discourse in landscape planning and design. However, traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom are similar in research and confounding when determining the research scope. Therefore, this study aims to define the distinction between traditional ecological knowledge and ecological wisdom in research through a systematic review of research articles, book chapters, and reviews published from 2017 to 2021. The selected primary studies were analyzed using bibliometric analysis run by VOS Viewer, followed by comparative analysis towards thematic codes. The coding process for the comparative analysis was conducted using NVivo. This study found that research on traditional ecological knowledge and ecological wisdom converges, especially on the topic of indigenous cultural capital, ecosystem services, and sustainability. The distinction between TEK and EW lies in their definition, agent, source, and scope. We propose a conceptual framework to understand the relationship between TEK and EW in the cultural landscape and clarify the scope of the analysis in this research. This study would help scholars develop research on both topics precisely and avoid bias in the theoretical discussion.

AB  - The public sector is a major purchaser for infrastructure materials and therefore is a critical potential buyer of products with recycled material or recovered content, diverting these from landfill, enhancing markets, and supporting recycling and recovery. Understanding barriers and drivers for the public sector is therefore critical, for enhancing procurement of goods with recycled material or recovered content. While most research has identified a range of barriers, other works have identified how these can be addressed and turned into facilitators for purchasing these goods. Synthesising the literature using as a systematic review, the drivers and barriers uncovered in past research allows us to explore how changes to the purchasing process can be undertaken, which address the Five core themes serving as both drivers and impediments: 1) procurement-function-related factors; 2) Organisational factors; 3) actual/perceived financial factors; 4) government-related social factors; and 5) supplier-related factors. The paper research objective is to identify how these factors influence the purchasing process for products with recycled material or recovered content. We the identified how the purchasing process can be modified to improve public purchasing process within this domain and also link these to future research activities. These include. creating green procurement standards, creating internal organisational support to identify options, information sharing within the organisation and with outside bodies regarding alternative products with recycled material or recovered content.

AB  - Artificial sweeteners (AS) are ubiquitous in food and beverage products, yet little is known about their effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and whether they play a role in the development of GI symptoms, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Utilizing the PubMed and Embase databases, we conducted a search for articles on individual AS and each of these terms: fermentation, absorption, and GI tract. Standard protocols for a systematic review were followed. At the end of our search, we found a total of 617 eligible papers, 26 of which were included. Overall, there is limited medical literature available on this topic. The 2 main areas on which there is data to suggest that AS affect the GI tract include motility and the gut microbiome, though human data is lacking, and most of the currently available data is derived from in vivo studies. The effect on motility is mainly indirect via increased incretin secretion, though the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown as the downstream effect on motility was not studied. The specific effects of AS on the microbiome have been conflicting and the available studies have been heterogeneous in terms of the population studied and both the. AS and doses evaluated. Further research is needed to assess whether AS could be a potential cause of GI symptoms. This is especially pertinent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a population in whom dietary interventions are routinely utilized as a management strategy.

AB  - Background and Aims. Prevalence of H. pylori antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, and it is the main factor affecting efficacy of current therapeutic regimens. Our aim was to review recent data on H. pylori resistance towards antibiotics in different countries. Methods. A systematic review of studies concerning primary H. pylori antibiotic resistance published through January 2006 to December 2009 was performed. Data were analyzed according to geographic area, age, sex, and gastroduodenal pathology. Results. The overall H. pylori antibiotic resistance rates were 17.2% (95% CI: 16.5-17.9%) for clarithromycin, 26.7% (95% CI: 25.2-28.1%) for metronidazole, 11.2% (95% CI: 9.6-12.7%) for amoxycillin, 16.2% (95% CI: 14.4-18%) for levofloxacin, 5.9% (95% CI: 4.7-7.1%) for tetracycline, 1.4% (95% CI: 0.81-9%) for rifabutin and 9.6% (95% Cl: 8.5-10.7%) for multiple antibiotics. Prevalence rate of clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin resistance significantly increased from Europe to Asia, America and Africa. Tetracycline resistance is low (<3%) in all countries, but Africa (43.9%). Prevalence of clarithromycin resistance was higher in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients, whilst metronidazole resistance was higher in peptic ulcer patients. Both resistances were significantly higher in female than in male patients. Data regarding amoxicillin resistance are highly conflicting. Conclusion. The worldwide H. pylori antibiotic resistance towards different antibiotics has increased. Such a phenomenon may affect therapeutic management in different countries.

AB  - This study systematically reviews the scientific literature (n = 56) on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of adaptation measures in cities and similar urban environments. The review is conducted to assess existing or proposed actions for dealing with impacts of drought, heat waves, sea-level rise, and pluvial and fluvial flooding. It includes over 30 measures related to structural, services, technological, informational and ecosystem-based approaches. The main findings demonstrate that CBA of adaptation measures across urban environments must contend with numerous long-term socioeconomic and climate change uncertainties. Subsequently, this has led to inconsistencies in valuation frameworks related to, for example, planning horizons, discount rates, non-market considerations and future scenarios. Results also indicate a clear gap in the literature on the economic valuation of adaptation measures in the Global South. Furthermore, few studies integrate equity dimensions while planning for adaptation. Extensions of CBA to account for key uncertainties will help policy makers to allocate (often scarce) resources more efficiently and limit the likelihood of maladaptation. Further inclusion of the magnitude and distributional effects of non-market impacts and greater civil society engagement in policy dialogues will also be vital for promoting just and equitable measures that balance adaptation alongside other policy goals such as mitigation, economic development, health and well-being.

AB  - Robust literature on sustainable tourism development has emerged globally both in economically developed and emerging economies. Over the past several decades, policymakers and business practitioners increasingly acknowledge that the long-term development and sustainability of tourism destinations require clear guidelines and direction. The impetus for sustainable tourism development has become ever more urgent as a result of dual trends of climate change and massification of the global tourism industry. The current research review used science mapping techniques to examine 1596 Scopus-indexed documents published on sustainable tourism development. The objectives of the review were to document the size, growth, and global distribution of this literature, identify its key journals, authors, and documents, highlight emerging topics, and illuminate the underlying intellectual structure of this literature. The review also provides guidelines for scholars to develop research that can aid in future sustainable tourism development.

AB  - Inland tropical freshwater shallow lakes' catchments are experiencing a severe threat to their sustainability. Changing the lake landscape affects ecosystem services (ESs). However, these connections are often overlooked, resulting in policy conflicts. This study identifies major ESs and their link to United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and discusses their potential trade-offs and synergies. The multiple data collection approaches were employed, such as systematic review, key informant interviews, focus group discussion, rapid participatory appraisal (PRA), and geospatial techniques. The study findings identify 18 major ESs. The identified ESs were linked to seven SDGs such as zero hunger (SDG2), clean water (SDG6), climate action (SDG13), sustainable communities (SDG11), clean energy (SDG7), education (SDG4), life on land (15), and responsible consumption and production (SDG12). The land use/land cover classes showed significant change from 1989 to 2019, with cultivated land and settlements, increased progressively by 49% and 149%, while forest land and water-bodies declining by 84% and 8.5%. These land use/land cover dynamics influenced trade-offs and synergies between ESs and had severe ecological and economic consequences on the lake ecosystem and the local population. The findings from this study create a public debate among the diverse stakeholders on the sustainable utilization of landscape and diverse ESs in the tropical freshwater shallow lakes' catchment to achieve several SDGs. The study recommends integrating various stakeholders' interests into the policy framework and balancing economic and ecological models to sustain the freshwater shallow lakes' ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding how species respond to climate change is key to informing vulnerability assessments and designing effective conservation strategies, yet research efforts on wildlife responses to climate change fail to deliver a representative overview due to inherent biases. Bats are a species-rich, globally distributed group of organisms that are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change because of their high surface-to-volume ratios and low reproductive rates. We systematically reviewed the literature on bat responses to climate change to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps and biases and highlight future research needs. We found that studies are geographically biased towards Europe, North America and Australia, and temperate and Mediterranean biomes, thus missing a substantial proportion of bat diversity and thermal responses. Less than half of the published studies provide concrete evidence for bat responses to climate change. For over a third of studied bat species, response evidence is only based on predictive species distribution models. Consequently, the most frequently reported responses involve range shifts (57% of species) and changes in patterns of species diversity (26%). Bats showed a variety of responses, including both positive (e.g. range expansion and population increase) and negative responses (range contraction and population decrease), although responses to extreme events were always negative or neutral. Spatial responses varied in their outcome and across families, with almost all taxonomic groups featuring both range expansions and contractions, while demographic responses were strongly biased towards negative outcomes, particularly among Pteropodidae and Molossidae. The commonly used correlative modelling approaches can be applied to many species, but do not provide mechanistic insight into behavioural, physiological, phenological or genetic responses. There was a paucity of experimental studies (26%), and only a small proportion of the 396 bat species covered in the examined studies were studied using long-term and/or experimental approaches (11%), even though they are more informative about the effects of climate change. We emphasise the need for more empirical studies to unravel the multifaceted nature of bats' responses to climate change and the need for standardised study designs that will enable synthesis and meta-analysis of the literature. Finally, we stress the importance of overcoming geographic and taxonomic disparities through strengthening research capacity in the Global South to provide a more comprehensive view of terrestrial biodiversity responses to climate change.

AB  - The review and assessment of urban greening patterns play a crucial role in sustainable urban planning and green spaces (GSs) management, helping to improve human well-being. In recent years, various methods and strategies were applied to examine the relationship between GSs and environmental sustainability, but so far, no studies on systematic review and empirical assessments were carried out in Saudi Arabian context. Thus, a comprehensive review and assessment of current GSs patterns and planning strategies are important for achieving urban environmental sustainability. This study aims to assess spatial pattern of GSs across the cities and a bibliographic review on the urban greening strategies in the Saudi context. These six urban strategies were further supported from empirical evidence on Saudi cities. Geographical information system (GIS) techniques and questionnaire surveys were performed for spatial mapping of GSs and the perceived role of GSs strategies of the respondent to environmental sustainability across cities. The findings showed that (i) highest PCGS was reported from Dammam (5.4 m(2)) followed by Riyadh (1.18 m(2)), and Jeddah (0.5 m(2)); (ii) most of the respondents use GSs for picnic (59%), mental well-being (53%), and physical activities (47%), respectively; (iii) GSs play a significant role for local climate regulation such as temperature control (78%) and UHI reduction (81%), and GSs provide thermal comfort (84%), respectively; and (iv) 40% respondents do not use GSs due to the lack of availability, accessibility, design, management, and safety of GSs. Thus, such findings of the study surely assist planners and policy makers to understand and implement the suggested GSs strategies to meet the satisfaction level of the respondents as well as to manage GSs at neighborhood and city level for urban environmental sustainability.

AB  - Effective management of invasive alien species (IAS) requires comprehensive stakeholder engagement and a clear understanding of how people interact with these species. Such interactions are particularly complex in socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS), where local communities and their environment are highly inter-dependent. We reviewed the scientific literature to determine current views of the positive and negative effects of IAS on local communities in SEPLS, with the goals of better understanding interactions between people and IAS, and devising effective management strategies. Of the 105 IAS investigated in the 57 journal papers we found on the topic, 31 species were reported as being purely undesirable for the local communities, while 30 species were reported as purely desirable, and 44 species were both undesirable and desirable. We found that the instrumental value of IAS often constitutes these desirable effects, and that desirable IAS were likely to invite controversy among stakeholders over its management. A common compromise to address such conflicts was to work with stakeholders for the containment of the IAS, while at the same time to retain or amplify its desirable effects on people to ensure their involvement. In the long-run, however, IAS management in SEPLS cannot be exempted from the need for long-term goals and the strategy leading toward them. Such a strategy should devise practical tools, such as stringent risk assessment and black- and white-listing as well as an option to eradicate or replace highly invasive species that fully takes into account different perspectives about IAS.

AB  - Mountain ecosystem services (MES) can provide a wide range of benefits for human well-being, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. This systematic review work analyzed existed knowledge and research gaps on MES at the global level. The study used databases of science direct, Scopus and google scholar using searching, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) framework. Using specific keywords for the searching engine, the number of publications linked with MES were about 1252 which published between 1992 and June 2019. But, only 74 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The analysis highlighted the existence of gaps in the literature including case studies from a limited geographical areas, focus on regulating and provisioning services, and lack of studies that explore the kinds of interlink between ecosystem services, and occurrence of limitation linked with data and methodology. From the 74 publications used for analysis, only seven of them were addressed mainly trade-offs and synergies, but most of them focus on quantification, qualification and economic valuation of the services. From the total case studies, the services addressed were summed up to 317 services, and the services such as climate regulation, food and fodder, fresh water, recreation and ecotourism, and erosion regulation studied more. On the contrary, photosynthesis, ornamental resources, net primary production, disease regulation, genetic resources, water purification and waste treatments were the least studied. Therefore, future research works should focus on mountainous areas of no and least studied of its ecosystem services. Critical studies are also required that indicate the link between a human being with MES, the trade-offs and synergies between MES and the influence of human beings on the quality and accessibility of ecosystem services. Besides, priority should be given by researches for methodological development and proposing management option for the mountain ecosystem and resource. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to provide a systematic overview of the progress made in utilizing remote sensing for assessing the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on water resources (quality and quantity). This review also addresses research gaps, challenges, and opportunities associated with the use of remotely sensed data in assessment and monitoring. The progress of remote sensing applications in the assessment and monitoring of LULC, along with their impacts on water quality and quantity, has advanced significantly. The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, the integration of multiple sensors, and advanced classification techniques have improved the accuracy of land cover mapping and change detection. Furthermore, the study highlights the vast potential for providing detailed information on the monitoring and assessment of the relationship between LULC and water resources through advancements in data science analytics, drones, web-based platforms, and balloons. It emphasizes the importance of promoting research efforts, and the integration of remote sensing data with spatial patterns, ecosystem services, and hydrological models enables a more comprehensive evaluation of water quantity and quality changes. Continued advancements in remote sensing technology and methodologies will further improve our ability to assess and monitor the impacts of LULC changes on water quality and quantity, ultimately leading to more informed decision making and effective water resource management. Such research endeavors are crucial for achieving the effective and sustainable management of water quality and quantity.

AB  - The last decade has seen a profound increase in the development of assessment frameworks for ecosystem ser-vices, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NBS). This has improved understanding of NBS impact assessment, including processual aspects related to participatory planning and governance. We argue that, although representing a move in the right direction, NBS assessment frameworks would benefit from a broader framing of governance, including the role of government-led laws, policies and regulations along with community-led and collaborative multi-stakeholder initiatives. The consideration of marginalised communities and environmental justice should also be strengthened. To ensure a feasible and comprehensive approach to NBS governance assessment, we carried out a systematic literature review on the topic of urban NBS governance. Using thematic analysis, we developed a framework of five themes encompassing nine governance dimensions, of which some are further broken down into sub-dimensions. To assess the different NBS governance dimensions, we developed a tool in the format of a survey for urban decision-makers and other stakeholders, encompassing nine urban NBS governance indicators corresponding with the identified dimensions.
