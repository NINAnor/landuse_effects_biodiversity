AB  - Strawberry (Fragaria x ananasa Duch.) is the most economically important soft fruit worldwide. While self- and wind-pollination is possible for strawberry, without biotic pollination (animal pollinators, including artificial pollination by humans) rate of strawberry flowers rarely exceeds 60% and thus fruit production is decreased. At a time of widely recognized decline of pollinators and increasing global demand for balanced food, we need a comprehensive understanding of the worldwide valuation of these ecosystem services. In this paper, we use a transparent and systematic review process to detect gaps in the available literature. By applying multilevel meta-analytic models, we quantified the contribution of biotic pollinators and different pollinator types to strawberry fruits. Our review showed that research on strawberry pollination is clearly concentrated in European countries, with limited information for Asia – the largest strawberry producer. Additionally, we detected disproportions across research topics, stressing the need for further research on pollinator preferences between strawberry cultivars and the occurrence of managed and wild bee communities. The overall estimate of pollination benefit to strawberry crops is on average a 25% reduction in fruit weight for plants not receiving a biotic pollination treatment. This benefit is similar regardless of the pollinating species. The mean amount globally (2011–2020) receivable by producers from purchasers due to biotic pollination is $5.36 billion per year. Moreover, we demonstrated that strawberry plants that are dependent on self- or wind-pollination set on average 43% fewer seeds (fertilized achenes) than biotically pollinated plants. Such a huge reduction in seed set can cause fruit deformation and reduce the commercial value of strawberries. Together, these findings indicate the critical role of biotic pollination in strawberry production and quality. To ensure pollination services in strawberry farms and produce the best-quality fruits, growers should take action to sustain healthy pollinator communities and utilize them with the optimal cultivar. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) supply ecosystem services (ES) essential for human wellbeing. Mapping is a critical exercise that allows an understanding of the spatial distribution of the different ES in PAs. This work aims to conduct a systematic literature review on mapping ES in PAs. In order to carry out this systematic review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method was applied. The results showed an increase in the number of works between 2012 and 2023, and they were especially conducted in Europe and Asia and less in North America, South America, and Oceania. Most studies were developed in terrestrial areas, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified them into types II and IV. Most of the works followed the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classification and were mainly focused on the supply dimension. Regulating and maintenance and cultural ES were the most mapped dimensions in PAs. The most frequent provisioning ES mapped in PAs were Animals reared for nutritional purposes and Cultivated terrestrial plants grown for nutritional purposes. In regulating and maintenance, Maintaining nursery populations and habitats and Regulation of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans were the most analysed. For cultural ES, Characteristics of living systems that enable activities promoting health, recuperation, or enjoyment through active or immersive interactions and Characteristics of living systems that enable aesthetic experiences were the most mapped ES in PAs. Most works followed a quantitative approach, although the number of qualitative studies is high. Finally, most of the works needed to be validated, which may hamper the credibility of mapping ES in PAs. Overall, this systematic review contributed to a global picture of studies distribution, the areas where they are needed, and the most popular dimensions and sections as the methodologies were applied. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - FSC is a worldwide recognized forest certification scheme, that aims to promote the environmentally responsible management and conservation of the world's forests. Despite its broad application, there is little evidence of its effect on biodiversity. To address this important knowledge gap, here we conducted a systematic review and a hierarchical meta-analysis of the effects of FSC on biodiversity worldwide. Our review yielded 57 studies spanning 2004–2022. Most studies were in the Americas and Europe (31 % and 28 %, respectively), and largely focused on vascular plants (41 %). Half (51 %) of the studies aimed to determine the effect of FSC certification on biodiversity. There were 15 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, resulting in 231 effect sizes for mammal, bird, and vascular plant abundance and 10 for vascular plant richness. Overall, there is a neutral effect of certification on taxa abundance, with only a positive effect on mammal assemblages. Responses varied considerably between mammals' traits. Threatened species, individuals with reduced body weight, and omnivorous species benefit from management under the FSC scheme. Vascular plant richness exhibited significantly higher values in FSC-certified areas. Moreover, the abundance of vascular plants also differs among traits, with shrubs and adult trees benefiting from FSC certification. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in biodiversity responses to FSC, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. The overall neutral effect and the divergent responses of taxa and species traits suggest that taxa/species-specific management and improvement of FSC criteria are required. © 2023

T2  - Climate Risk Management
AB  - We assessed how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests through a systematic review of the international empirical research literature. We found that drought, precipitation variability, extreme precipitation and flooding, and extreme heat were the climatic stressors to which responses were most frequently documented. Individuals and households received the most research attention, followed by national government, civil society, and local government. Europe and North America were the geographic foci of more research than other regions. Behavioral responses were more reported than technical and infrastructural responses and institutional responses. Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests. The review also identifies opportunities for future research on adaptation to other climatic stressors, such as wildfires and tree pests and pathogens, adaptation in other geographic areas, especially Oceania, and adaptation by actors beyond the individual and household level and through institutional adaptation efforts. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Rapid industrialization has exacerbated the hazard to health and the environment. Wide spectrums of contaminants pose numerous risks, necessitating their disposal and treatment. There is a need for further remediation methods since pollutant residues cannot be entirely eradicated by traditional treatment techniques. Bio-adsorbents are gaining popularity due to their eco-friendly approach, broad applicability, and improved functional and surface characteristics. Adsorbents that have been modified have improved qualities that aid in their adsorptive nature. Adsorption, ion exchange, chelation, surface precipitation, microbial uptake, physical entrapment, biodegradation, redox reactions, and electrostatic interactions are some of the processes that participate in the removal mechanism of biosorbents. These processes can vary depending on the particular biosorbent and the type of pollutants being targeted. The systematic review focuses on the many modification approaches used to remove environmental contaminants. Different modification or activation strategies can be used depending on the type of bio-adsorbent and pollutant to be remediated. Physical activation procedures such as ultrasonication and pyrolysis are more commonly used to modify bio-adsorbents. Ultrasonication process improves the adsorption efficiency by 15–25%. Acid and alkali modified procedures are the most effective chemical activation strategies for adsorbent modification for pollution removal. Chemical modification increases the removal to around 95–99%. The biological technique involving microbial culture is an emerging field that needs to be investigated further for pollutant removal. A short evaluation of modified adsorbents with multi-pollutant adsorption capability that have been better eliminated throughout the adsorption process has been provided. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Environmental Evidence
AB  - Background: To phase out fossil fuels and reach a carbon–neutral future, solar energy and notably photovoltaic (PV) installations are being rapidly scaled up. Unlike other types of renewable energies such as wind and hydroelectricity, evidence on the effects of PV installations on biodiversity has been building up only fairly recently and suggests that they may directly impact ecosystems and species through, for instance, habitat change and loss, mortality, behaviour alteration or population displacements. Hence, we conducted a systematic map of existing evidence aiming at answering the following question: what evidence exists regarding the effects of PV installations on wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species? Methods: We searched for relevant citations on four online publication databases, on Google Scholar, on four specialised websites and through a call for grey literature. Citations were then screened for eligibility in order to only retain citations referring to wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species as well as PV and solar thermal installations, therefore excluding concentrated solar power. Accepted articles were first split into studies (corresponding to one experimental design) subjected to critical appraisal and then further split into observations (i.e. one population and one outcome) during metadata extraction. The current state of the literature was characterised and knowledge clusters and gaps identified. Review findings: Searching captured 8121 unique citations, which resulted in 158 relevant articles being accepted after screening. Even though the first article was published in 2005, the publication rate increased rapidly in 2020. The 97 included primary research and modelling articles were split into 137 unique studies and rated with either a low (43.8%), a high (41.6%) or an unclear overall risk of bias (14.6%) after internal validity assessment. Studies were further split into 434 observations, mainly carried out in the United States (23.0%) and the United Kingdom (21.0%), preferentially in temperate climates (64.5%). Plants and arthropods were the two most studied taxa (41.7% and 26.3%, respectively). Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) facilities were most often investigated (70.1%). Observations mainly focused on the effect of the presence of PV installations (51.8%). Species abundance, community composition and species diversity were the most common outcomes assessed (23.0%, 18.4% and 16.1%, respectively). Conclusions: Three knowledge clusters for which a systematic review should be contemplated were identified: (i) the effects of PV installations on plant and (ii) arthropod communities and, (iii) their effects at a larger ecosystem scale on overall species abundance. However, the currently available evidence regarding the effects of photovoltaic installations on biodiversity is still scarce. More research is urgently needed on non-flying mammals and bats as well as amphibians and reptiles. Solar thermal panels and floating PV installations should also be further investigated. Studies comparing different designs of PV installations, management practices or contexts should be conducted as well. Indeed, more evidence is still needed to allow decision-makers to accurately and reliably select the types of PV installations and management practices that are least damaging to biodiversity. © 2023, The Author(s).

T2  - Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment
AB  - This systematic review examines existing literature on environmental long-term agreements (LTAs), such as conservation covenants, to identify the enablers and barriers to adoption and thus their potential for use in new contexts such as across land boundaries. To achieve environmental and societal targets, there is a clear and urgent need for more ambitious, longer-term agri-environment funding mechanisms which operate at a large scale. This is, in part, due to the recognition by national governments that shifts in policy for long-term sustainability are needed since many existing agri-environment schemes have not had the desired outcomes. The recent inclusion of conservation covenants in the UK's Environment Act demonstrates one such attempt to address this issue. Through critically analyzing the use of LTAs across the world using a systematic rapid evidence assessment approach, this article assesses the potential of these agreements to deliver landscape-scale environmental benefits and public goods that are increasingly being sought by national governments as they strive for transformative policies to prevent and mitigate environmental and climate catastrophes. Exploring the enablers and barriers to adoption, alongside examples of successful LTAs, we provide an overview from which interested parties—policymakers, land managers, and private enterprises, among others—can begin to understand the opportunities and barriers which surround these agreements. Overall, this literature review identifies several factors likely to affect the uptake of LTAs, including concerns around land managers' and stakeholders' real/perceived capacity to engage, a need for flexibility, finance structures, and how monitoring and evaluation are managed.

AB  - Wind power is a rapidly growing source of energy worldwide. It is crucial for climate change mitigation, but it also accelerates the degradation of biodiversity through habitat loss and the displacement of wildlife. To understand the extent of displacement and reasons for observations where no displacement is reported, we conducted a systematic review of birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals. Eighty-four peer-reviewed studies of onshore wind power yielded 160 distinct displacement distances, termed cases. For birds, bats, and mammals, 63 %, 72 %, and 67 % of cases respectively reported displacement. Cranes (3/3 cases), owls (2/2), and semi-domestic reindeer (6/6) showed consistent displacement on average up to 5 km. Gallinaceus birds showed displacement on average up to 5 km, but in 7/18 cases reported to show “no displacement”. Bats were displaced on average up to 1 km in 21/29 cases. Waterfowl (6/7 cases), raptors (24/30), passerines (16/32) and waders (8/19) were displaced on average up to 500 m. Observations of no displacement were suggested to result from methodological deficiencies, species-specific characteristics, and habitat conditions favorable for certain species after wind power development. Displacement-induced population decline could be mitigated by situating wind power in low-quality habitats, minimizing the small-scale habitat loss and collisions, and creating high-quality habitats to compensate for habitat loss. This review provides information on distance thresholds that can be employed in the design of future wind energy projects. However, most studies assessed the effects of turbine towers of <100 m high, while considerably larger turbines are being built today. © 2023

TI  - Relationships between soil ecosystem services in temperate annual field crops: A systematic review

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Agricultural soils provide multiple ecosystem services (ES) that can replace chemical inputs to support agricultural production. However, most arable cropping systems are managed with little concern for preserving ecological functions, which could reduce their ability to provide these ES. An increasing number of studies assess ES from agroecosystems, but analysis of multiple ES distinguishing relationships that may exist between them and between these ES and their drivers is lacking. Thus, we performed a systematic literature review of soil-based ES relationships, with a focus on temperate annual field crops. Forty relevant studies out of 870 were selected for the analysis. We created an original ontology of soil-based ES, based on the indicators used to assess them, to which we added soil-based negative impacts and biomass production (defined as a good) to combine the ES approach and the impact approach. We summarized each positive (synergy), negative (trade-off) or non-significant relationship in these studies, which were either quantitative or qualitative. We highlighted key relationships that have never been investigated in the corpus selected, such as relationships between C sequestration and physical soil quality regulation, soil erosion regulation or soil biodiversity. Relationships between biomass production and soil-based ES or impacts were investigated the most and were mainly non-significant. This suggests there are agroecological practices for which maximizing bundles of ES does not always decrease agricultural production. Relationships between soil biodiversity and soil-based ES were exclusively synergistic or non-significant. Summarizing effects of drivers of these relationships revealed that the three pillars of conservation agriculture — rotation diversification (with ley or legumes), soil coverage with cover crops and reduced tillage — and organic fertilization seem promising practices to help provide balanced bundles of ES and potentially reduce negative agronomic impacts. We highlighted potential trade-offs that should be consciously considered when adapting management strategies. © 2023

T2  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
AB  - Agricultural land use is a major driver of biodiversity decline worldwide, but adopting sustainable farming practices can help to restore or maintain biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The common biodiversity declines in monocultures may be mitigated by intercropping, which means diversification with multiple crops in the same field. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using data from 18 countries published in 63 articles, to quantitatively assess the overall effect size of intercropping on beneficial arthropods and pest populations. We also evaluated whether the effect of intercropping varies between different crop combinations and with the spatial arrangement of crops. We used monoculture as a control system, which served as a proxy for agricultural intensification. We found that intercropping, compared to monoculture, significantly increased the overall abundance of beneficial arthropods by 36%, density by 94%, and species richness by 27%. Intercropping reduced 38% of the abundance and 41% of the density of arthropod pests, while their species richness was not affected. Intercropping consistently affected positively the species richness of pollinators, parasitoids, and predators. The combination of cereal-legume outperformed cereal-cereal in promoting beneficial arthropods while reducing pests. Regarding spatial arrangement, row and strip were more effective than mixed and relay intercropping in supporting beneficial arthropods and controlling pests. According to our results, intercropping is an effective practice to mitigate the adverse impacts of agricultural intensification on beneficial arthropods in agroecosystems. Our findings may encourage farmers to adopt intercropping over intensive monoculture and policymakers to consider incentives for intercropping in agri-environmental schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem disturbance is increasing in extent, severity and frequency across the globe. To date, research has largely focussed on the impacts of disturbance on animal population size, extinction risk and species richness. However, individual responses, such as changes in body condition, can act as more sensitive metrics and may provide early warning signs of reduced fitness and population declines. We conducted the first global systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the impacts of ecosystem disturbance on reptile and amphibian body condition. We collated 384 effect sizes representing 137 species from 133 studies. We tested how disturbance type, species traits, biome and taxon moderate the impacts of disturbance on body condition. We found an overall negative effect of disturbance on herpetofauna body condition (Hedges' g = −0.37, 95% CI: −0.57, −0.18). Disturbance type was an influential predictor of body condition response and all disturbance types had a negative mean effect. Drought, invasive species and agriculture had the largest effects. The impact of disturbance varied in strength and direction across biomes, with the largest negative effects found within Mediterranean and temperate biomes. In contrast, taxon, body size, habitat specialisation and conservation status were not influential predictors of disturbance effects. Our findings reveal the widespread effects of disturbance on herpetofauna body condition and highlight the potential role of individual-level response metrics in enhancing wildlife monitoring. The use of individual response metrics alongside population and community metrics would deepen our understanding of disturbance impacts by revealing both early impacts and chronic effects within affected populations. This could enable early and more informed conservation management. © 2023 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Effects of prescribed fire on the post-fire hydrological processes in agro-forest ecosystems: A systematic review and a meta-analysis
AU  - Zema, D.A.
AU  - Lucas-Borja, M.E.
T2  - Hydrological Processes
AB  - Prescribed fires are one of the most effective tools to reduce the risk of wildfires but this treatment may negatively affect the hydrological and erosive response of soil, with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion. Many studies have been published on this matter but there is no consensus in the literature on the magnitude and duration of these effects since the relevant hydrological conditions are site-specific. Moreover, the relationship between post-fire hydrology and its main environmental drivers has been little explored. This study has carried out a bibliographic review and a meta-analysis of the changes resulting from prescribed fire applications (water infiltration, soil water repellency (SWR), surface runoff and soil erosion) using a database of 85 case studies from 41 academic papers that have been published over the last 23 years. The effects of annual precipitation, soil slope, burn severity, fire application season, post-fire ground cover, and vegetation type on those changes have also been statistically explored. The bibliographic review has revealed that previous case studies have not been equally distributed across the globe but concentrated in only a few countries, mainly the United States and Spain. The meta-analysis has revealed that (i) water infiltration generally decreases and SWR appears with noticeable increases in surface runoff and soil erosion immediately after the prescribed fire, while the pre-fire values progressively recover over time; (ii) the window of disturbance in burned soils may last a few months (with some exceptions); (iii) annual precipitation and soil slope significantly influence water infiltration and surface runoff, but not soil erosion, in both the short-term and medium-term; (iv) moderate-to-high levels of soil burn severity severely enhance surface runoff and soil erosion, and noticeably reduce water infiltration in the short-term; (v) the level of ground cover burning is important for reducing the runoff rates, but it plays a minor role in water infiltration and soil erosion rates;and (vi) the prescribed fire applied in spring results in lower increases in short-term runoff and erosion, while fire applications in summer and in shrublands produce the highest increases in soil loss. The following practical recommendations arise from this study: (i) research should be better distributed across all environmental contexts on a global scale; (ii) post-fire management actions should be immediately implemented after the prescribed fire application; (iii) prescribed fire should be carried out in spring and the soil burn severity should be kept low during burning; (iv) the monitoring studies should be prolonged at least for some years (more than two or three) after prescribed fire; (iv) the catchment-scale investigations, although more difficult and expensive, should be encouraged (avoiding, however, areas to sparsely burnt in the context of the whole catchment); (v) the monitored variables should also include the most important physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, the cover and structure of regenerating vegetation, as well as the water quality parameters; (vi) the effects of repeated applications of prescribed fire should be experimentally assessed; and (vii) guidelines for standardized and appropriate measurements and analytical methods in experimental activities should be set up. These indications support the use of land managers in the monitoring of the hydrological impacts of the prescribed fire and in the choice of sites where post-fire management actions must be implemented. The last recommendation of this study is the creation of an experimental database supporting the bibliographic review and the meta-analysis, which is made available to other researchers and land managers, to create a public, easily-accessible and comprehensive tool for future research needs and professional use. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Flower strips have become a prevalent measure in agricultural landscapes to counteract biodiversity loss and especially promote pollinators. Although their benefits for pollinating insects have been frequently evaluated and reported, generalized conclusions about optimal settings for effective flower strips are still difficult. From the perspective of pollinators, flower strips vary distinctly in habitat quality, and the same applies for the control sites selected for scientific studies. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach based on a systematic review of recent studies (2009–2020) to analyze the relationship between flower strip effectiveness for pollinators and the contrast in habitat quality between flower strips and control sites. We extracted 350 data entries from 29 of 172 studies based on available data for richness or abundance of the pollinator taxa groups Apiformes, Lepidoptera and Syrphidae as response variables, for both flower strips and control treatments. All flower strips and control treatments were assigned a habitat quality score including information on spatial dimension, floral resources and management. Moreover, we included information on landscape complexity as measured by percent cover of seminatural habitats in the studied landscape. In general, our results of meta-analytical models showed an increasing effect size of flower strips on pollinators for higher contrasts in habitat quality between flower strips and control treatments. This relationship was consistent across pollinator taxa and different levels of landscape complexity. Altogether, in terms of pollinator habitat quality, high-quality flower strips were more attractive than low-quality flower strips, and the reported effectiveness of flower strips decreased from low-quality to high-quality control treatments. We recommend that results of future studies evaluating flower strips for pollinators are always linked with the contrast in habitat quality between selected flower strips and control treatments. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Mitigation pathways that stabilise global warming to 1.5 °C describe rapidly increasing deployment of land-based solutions, including increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass. This places additional demands on land, which is also required to provide food security and other ecosystem services. Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture has the potential to facilitate meeting demands for food and fibre, while simultaneously meeting environmental and ecological goals. The scientific literature has most often addressed the challenge of SI separately to climate change mitigation objectives in agricultural systems. Using a systematic review approach, we explored the compatibility of SI and carbon sequestration research through two contrasting case studies: Case Study I on Grassland Agriculture in Europe, and Case Study II on Smallholder Agriculture in Africa. We find contrasting levels of research theme similarity for SI and carbon sequestration, with European grassland agriculture research having lower similarity compared with African smallholder agriculture research. There was a focus on minimising biodiversity loss and environmental impacts in Europe, in contrast to a food security emphasis in Africa, reflecting regional and development differences. While there are clear context and agricultural-system specific differences between both case studies, both suggest that sustainable land use policies can be used to achieve SI integrated with climate mitigation in agriculture. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Edible landscapes provide a series of benefits for the sustainable development of a city, and therefore, in recent years, their development has become a fashion which has stimulated research. However, there is a need for a comprehensive, integrated, literature review, to increase people's knowledge of edible landscapes for a sustainable future. Therefore, this paper conducts a systematic review through the Preferred Reporting Initiative for Systematic Evaluation and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). This study was conducted using Web of Science and Google Scholar, and 41 eligible articles were selected from the 2004 articles originally identified from the years 1975–2022. These articles were related to the topics of (1) ecology, (2) food safety, (3) social, economic and healing benefits, (4) construction, and (5) understanding, motivation, and evaluation. The findings suggest that, first, the creation of edible landscapes in different urban areas of the world can have different effects, with most studies showing that the creation of edible landscapes in urban areas can increase ecological diversity. Despite this, some individual studies draw different conclusions. Secondly, most studies show that the development of edible landscapes in urban areas is beneficial for increasing food production and thus improving urban food security, provided that the land is not contaminated. Again, some studies have found that developing edible landscapes in urban areas has social and economic benefits. However, without a reasonable management mechanism, this process is prone to contradictions and thus unproductive. Therefore, urban land policies, land contamination, and management issues in different countries have limited the further development of urban edible landscapes. This study suggests that future research on edible landscapes can be conducted in the areas of land policy, land pollution control, and management mechanisms to solve these problems and promote further development. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Reverse Logistics (RL) of end-of-use/end-of-life products has become a vital part of circular economy practices for manufacturers. However, significant quantities of resources are still landfilled instead of being recovered. With mounting pressure on businesses to address the sustainability crises (resources, climate change, waste, toxicity) on account of the take-make-dispose-based linear economy, companies today realise the importance of RL but face several barriers to implementing it, including a lack of knowledge. Although several studies have investigated different aspects of RL in various industries in different country settings, less attention has been devoted to developing a systematic and holistic approach for designing and implementing RL. To address these gaps, this paper reviews 116 scholarly articles published between 2011 and 2021 to identify attributes related to the design and implementation of RL systems. Based on a systematic literature review, a conceptual framework is presented covering the key activities, drivers and barriers, stakeholder engagement and performance management in RL. Such a framework can support companies evaluate different approaches and strategies, as well as the opportunities and challenges of designing and implementing RL and transitioning towards a Circular Economy. © 2022 The Authors

T2  - Agriculture and Human Values
AB  - Agricultural intensification and landscape homogenisation are major drivers of biodiversity loss in European agricultural landscapes. Improvements require changes in farming practices, but empirical evidence on farmers’ motivations underlying their on-farm biodiversity management remains fragmented. To date, there is no aggregated overview of behavioural determinants that influence European farmers’ decisions to implement biodiversity-friendly farming practices. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 150 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022. We identified 108 potential determinants of farmers’ behaviour, which were integrated into a multilevel framework. The results show that the farmers’ decisions are complex and often non-directional processes, shaped by numerous external (at a society, landscape, community, and farm level) and internal factors. These factors are embedded in regional and cultural contexts. However, the analysis of study sites indicates that the spatial coverage of scientific evidence on biodiversity-friendly farming measures is uneven across Europe. Given the diversity of local and socio-cultural conditions, there is a need for public policies, including the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, to address more specifically determinants encouraging biodiversity-friendly farm management. This entails reflecting culture-specific perspectives and incorporating experiential knowledge into multilevel policy design processes, as well as offering regionally adapted advice on measure implementation and biodiversity impacts. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems have gained significant attention as a sustainable cropping approach that not only improves crop yields but also contributes to climate change adaptation and mitigation through enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, a comprehensive understanding of the influence of soil texture and climate conditions on SOC sequestration under CA remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA method, analyzing data from 35 peer-reviewed articles encompassing 71 field experiments and 451 observations worldwide. Our findings demonstrate the substantial positive impact of CA on SOC sequestration, with an overall increase of approximately 78%. Remarkably, only a mere 2% of observations reported neutral effects, while 20% indicated adverse outcomes. Notably, SOC sequestration rates were highest in tropical regions experiencing dry winters, reaching an impressive 2.50 Mg/ha/year in the topsoil layers. Moreover, fine and moderate textured soils, such as clay, clay loam, loam, and clay sandy, exhibited higher SOC sequestration rates (20-27%) compared to coarse-textured soils dominated by sandy proportions (9%). These findings emphasize the significance of climate conditions and soil texture in shaping the impact of CA on SOC sequestration. © The authors.

T2  - Environmental Sciences Europe
AB  - Agriculture, the world’s most dominant land use type, burdens freshwater biodiversity with a multitude of stressors such as diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alteration. However, it is difficult to directly link agricultural land use with biota response as agricultural stressors can also originate from other causes. Also, there is evidence for positive and negative effects of agriculture on organisms, agricultural impact differs strongly with the biological metric and study region considered and agricultural impact differs among practice and type, which in turn affects different organism groups with varying severity. Against this background, our study aimed at assessing, if agricultural land use has a consistent effect on river biota. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, which yielded 43 studies and 76 relationships between agriculture and aquatic organism groups. The relationships were subjected to a meta-analysis using Hedge’s g to calculate the standardized mean difference of effects. Overall, we detected a medium to strong effect g = − 0.74 of agricultural land use on freshwater biota, only marginally influenced by study design, river type and region. Strong differences in biota response could be observed depending on the biological metric assessed, with ecological quality indices of agricultural impairment performing best. Sensitive taxa declined with agricultural impact, while tolerant taxa tended to benefit. In addition, the biota response differed among agricultural types and practices and organism group, with macroinvertebrates showing the strongest effect. Our results quantify the effects of agriculture on riverine biota and suggest biological metric types for assessing agricultural impact. Further research is needed to discriminate between agricultural types and account for intensity. © 2022, The Author(s).

T2  - Environmental Evidence
AB  - Background: Agroforestry bridges the gap that often separates agriculture and forestry by building integrated systems to address both environmental and socio-economic objectives. Existing empirical research has suggested that agroforestry—the integration of trees with crops and/or livestock—can prevent environmental degradation, improve agricultural productivity, increase carbon sequestration, and support healthy soil and healthy ecosystems while providing stable incomes and other benefits to human welfare. However, the extent of the literature supporting or refuting these claims has not been well documented. This study addresses this research gap by collating and describing the evidence for the impacts of agroforestry on ecosystem services and human well-being in high-income countries and presents the characteristics and gaps in the literature. Methods: We searched 5 primary databases and 24 organizational websites using a pre-defined search string designed to capture articles relating agroforestry practices and policy interventions to outcomes in high-income countries. Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature published in the English language between January 1990 and June 2020. We screened the identified articles for inclusion or exclusion in two stages: title/abstract and full text. We extracted data from articles included at the full-text stage to form the map and associated database. For inclusion, the study in question must have assessed the impacts of the deliberate promotion and/or actual integration of woody perennials (trees, shrubs, etc.) with agricultural crops and/or animals. Results: Our search returned 31,852 articles of which we included 585 primary articles, 6 ongoing primary articles, and 41 systematically conducted literature reviews. The articles spanned three decades and 31 countries. The most studied practices are on linear boundary plantings (hedgerows, shelterbelts, windbreaks, and riparian buffers) and silvopasture systems. The most studied outcome is regulation and maintenance of physical, chemical, and biological conditions as an ecosystem service, followed by agricultural yield and mediation of waste/toxics/other nuisances (nutrient runoff and carbon storage). Conclusions: Results highlight key evidence gaps and areas where research has concentrated. Knowledge on the impacts of specific policy interventions to promote agroforestry remains scarce. The impacts of actual agroforestry practices are more well-studied, but the kinds of practices studied are limited, with most research focusing on two-component systems consisting of a simple tree configuration with one crop or livestock species, such as shelterbelts, windbreaks, and hedgerows, riparian buffers, and scattered trees on farms with crops and/or livestock. Regulating ecosystem services outcomes are by far the most studied, followed by agricultural productivity (an aspect of provisioning ecosystem services), while evidence on human well-being remains limited. We also found geographic biases, with little to no evidence for many countries. These biases suggest the strong need for further research to build the evidence base on agroforestry across high-income countries. The results can inform future research and policy decisions by making the evidence easily accessible and highlighting knowledge gaps as well as areas with enough evidence to conduct further systematic review. © 2022, The Author(s).

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Lake ecosystems are essential for human wellbeing and development for their capacity to provide multiple ecosystem services (ES). However, because of an anthropogenic-driven ecologic degradation, the sustainable supply of lake ES is at risk. It is, therefore, necessary to restore lake ecosystems and their ES for the sustainable support of future generations. There is a lack of knowledge about mapping lakes ES at the global level. This study conducts a systematic literature review focused on mapping lake ES. Initially, 617 studies were identified. However, only 30 studies were considered. The 30 studies identified were published between 2015 and 2021. Most of them were conducted in Asia, followed by Europe and America. The selected works covered all three Common International Classification of ES sections (regulating and maintenance, provisioning and cultural). We identified a similar number of works carried out in all the sections. Most of the studies were performed at a regional scale and focused on ES supply. Methodologically, an equal number of works followed qualitative and quantitative approaches. In total, 13 different methods were identified. The most used were the ES value (ESV) and biophysical modelling. Less than half of the works that applied the ESV method mapped all the ES analysed. Among the studies assessed, most were focused on environmental and socio-economic aspects. Only 1 study attempted to validate the results. Overall, 16 studies assessed the drivers of change impacts on ES supply. Nevertheless, only 1 considered climate change. The other 15 only considered land-use changes. This systematic review showed that a small number of works focused on lake ES mapping. Although challenging, there is an urgent global need for studies in this domain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11–25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6–10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion. Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested. Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species’ habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power. Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species’ response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia. Given that a broader set of biodiversity aspects are to be protected, best overall biodiversity impacts for a variety of species at landscape level can be achieved by ensuring that there is a mosaic of different forests within landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Marine ecosystems contribute to human well-being, e.g. through the promotion of nature-based recreational activities such as surfing, which is a benefit obtained from Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our research objective is to identify the benefits and impacts associated to surfing, and who are the main affected subjects and/or objects, achieving a better understanding of the sustainability status of this recreational activity. To this end, a bibliometric study and systematic review was carried out for the period 1965–2021. Benefits and impacts were collated and grouped according to their dimensional focus and type of effects in 6 groups (3-dimensional focus × 2 type of effects). The results revealed that since the beginning of 21st century surfing research topics are growing and diversifying. This review shows that implications of surfing go beyond direct users (i.e., surfers) and has consequences in diverse dimensions (environmental, socio cultural and economic), involving many stakeholders (e.g., scientific, and local communities). Most of the pieces of evidence collated in this research were related with the people who practice the activity and its social implications (psychological benefits as main benefit and injuries as main impact). Following an interdisciplinary approach, we obtained a holistic understanding of the surfing activity, not only in terms of the different dimensions addressed but on the sectors of the society that obtain benefits or are impacted by the activity. All of them should be considered and integrated to guarantee the sustainable management of this CES benefit. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This study employed a comprehensive systematic review of the literature (SRL) process with the Content Analysis Toolkits for Academic Research (CATAR) for conducting a bibliometric analysis of the 2814 general SDG-related papers and 92 review papers selected from the Web of Science database from 2013 to 2022. The overview analysis found that the US and UK took the lead in publication and citation. The WHO and several universities were identified as the most promi-nent institutes around the globe. The field distribution of the most cited papers revealed the exist-ence of a “strong sustainability” paradigm and the importance of science and technology. A landscape of 1123 papers was included in eight clusters according to the bibliographic coupling algorithms in the Multi-stage Document Clustering (MSDC) process. These clusters were then catego-rized into three groups, “synergies and trade-offs”, “networking”, and “systems analysis”, demon-strated in the theme maps. As for the 92 SDG-related review papers, most were shaped based on literature analysis without specified countries. Moreover, SDG 3 was identified as that exclusively studied in most papers. The information presented is expected to help research scholars, public sectors, and practitioners monitor, gather, check, analyze, and use the growing volume of SDG-related academic articles. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - While agricultural intensification and expansion are major factors driving loss and degradation of natural habitat and species decline, some wildlife species also benefit from agriculturally managed habitats. This may lead to high population densities with impacts on both human livelihoods and wildlife conservation. Cranes are a group of 15 species worldwide, affected both negatively and positively by agricultural practices. While eleven species face critical population declines, numbers of common cranes (Grus grus) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) have increased drastically in the last 40 years. Their increase is associated with higher incidences of crane foraging on agricultural crops, causing financial losses to farmers. Our aim was to synthesize scientific knowledge on the bilateral effects of land use change and crane populations. We conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed publications on agriculture-crane interactions (n = 135) and on the importance of agricultural crops in the diet of cranes (n = 81). Agricultural crops constitute a considerable part of the diet of all crane species (average of 37%, most frequently maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)). Crop damage was identified in only 10% of all agriculture-crane interactions, although one-third of interactions included cranes foraging on cropland. Using a conceptual framework analysis, we identified two major pathways in agriculture-crane interactions: (1) habitat loss with negative effects on crane species dependent on specific habitats, and (2) expanding agricultural habitats with superabundant food availability beneficial for opportunistic crane species. The degree to which crane species can adapt to agricultural land use changes may be an important factor explaining their population response. We conclude that multi-objective management needs to combine land sparing and land sharing strategies at landscape scale. To support viable crane populations while guaranteeing sustainable agricultural production, it is necessary to include the perspectives of diverse stakeholders and streamline conservation initiatives and agricultural policy accordingly. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Intensification of agricultural production and simplification of landscape structure have negatively affected arthropod communities, in particular since the end of Second World War. Agri-environment schemes may partly compensate for these losses and enhance arthropod populations, but their effectiveness is higher in simple landscapes rather than complex landscapes, characterized by a large proportion and diversity of semi-natural areas. As the landscape-scale species pool is known to drive local species richness, we tested our hypothesis that landscape complexity determines local arthropod species richness, whereas local management affects only arthropod abundance. Here we undertake a meta-analysis as part of a wider systematic review of the effects of land use heterogeneity on arthropod species richness. We searched for studies quantifying the effects of agri-environment schemes (e.g. wildflower strips/areas, grassy field margins, organic farming) and landscape complexity on arthropod richness and abundance. We additionally separated vegetation- vs. ground-dwelling taxa, because the effects were hypothesized to be greater in the more mobile vegetation-dwelling taxa. As expected, increasing landscape complexity enhanced arthropod richness, but not their abundance. Unexpectedly, agri-environment schemes did not only support the abundance of arthropods, but also their species richness. This pattern was driven by the vegetation-dwelling, not the ground-dwelling taxa, presumably because the higher mobility of vegetation-dwelling taxa allows faster responses to environmental changes. Our results show that agri-environment schemes in Europe benefit both arthropod abundance and species richness, whereas increasing landscape complexity primarily enhances species richness. This is why both local and landscape management need to be taken into account to halt current biodiversity losses in agricultural landscapes. Agri-environment schemes need to be implemented at a larger spatial and temporal scales to enhance landscape complexity, maintaining or restoring biodiversity sustainably. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Context: For many organisms, responses to climate change (CC) will be affected by land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC). However, the extent to which LULCC is concurrently considered in climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) is unclear. Objectives: We identify trends in inclusion of LULCC and CC in vulnerability assessments of species and the direction and magnitude of their combined effect on biodiversity. Further, we examine the effect size of LULCC and CC in driving changes in “currencies” of response to CC, such as distribution, abundance and survival. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the last 30 years that focused on CCVA and accounted for impacts of both CC and LULCC. Results: Across 116 studies, 34% assumed CC and LULCC would act additively, while 66% allowed for interactive effects. The majority of CCVAs reported similar effect sizes for CC and LULCC, although they affected different CCVA currencies. Only 14% of the studies showed larger effects of CC than of LULCC. Another 14% showed larger effects of LULCC than CC, specifically for dispersal, population viability, and reproduction, which tend to be strongly affected by fragmentation and disturbance. Although most studies found that LULCC and CC had negative effects on species currencies, in some cases effects were neutral or even positive. Conclusions: CCVAs that incorporate LULCC provided a better account of drivers of vulnerability, and highlight aspects of drivers that are generally more amenable to on-the-ground management intervention than CCVAs that focus on CC alone. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Bioenergy has been identified as a key contributor to future energy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets, and is relied upon in scenarios both with and without bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, owing to the multiple ways in which bioenergy can substitute fossil fuels. Understanding the environmental and societal impacts of land-use change (LUC) to bioenergy crops is important in determining where and how they could be deployed, and the resulting trade-offs and co-benefits. We use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the existing literature on two poorly understood impacts of this LUC that are likely to have an important effect on public acceptability: cultural ecosystem services and biodiversity. We focus on the impact of LUC to non-food bioenergy crops on agricultural landscapes, where large-scale bioenergy planting may be required. Our meta-analysis finds strong benefits for biodiversity overall (up 75% ± 13%), with particular benefits for bird abundance (+81% ± 32%), bird species richness (+100% ± 31%), arthropod abundance (+52% ± 36%), microbial biomass (+77% ± 24%), and plant species richness (+25% ± 22%), when land moves out of either arable crops or grassland to bioenergy production. Conversions from arable land to energy trees led to particularly strong benefits, providing an insight into how future LUC to non-food bioenergy crops could support biodiversity. There were inadequate data to complete a meta-analysis on the effects of non-food bioenergy crops on cultural ecosystem services, and few generalizable conclusions from a systematic review of the literature, however, findings highlight the importance of landscape context and planting strategies in determining impact. Our findings demonstrate improved farm-scale biodiversity on agricultural land with non-food bioenergy crops, but also limited knowledge concerning public response to this LUC, which could prove crucial to the successful expansion of bioenergy to meet the Paris targets.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Farmland birds belong to the most endangered group of vertebrates in Europe. They are an important component of farmland biodiversity considering the numerous functions they perform (e.g. seed dispersal, improving germination, increasing gene flow, nutrient recycling, and pest control). Therefore, their decline imposes substantial risks on agricultural ecosystems. In general, farmland bird conservation includes land-use and management alterations leading to less-intensive farming and land-sparing for breeding habitats (e.g. agri-environment-climate schemes, and organic farming). However, theoretical concepts describing farmland biodiversity maintenance and applied conservation measures usually ignore the role of singular, often very small, natural or man-made elements in an agricultural landscape. These elements play a role in the populations of certain species, their biology and in the general species richness of farmland. Furthermore, the importance of these elements has never been empirically tested, which means that conservationists and practitioners are not aware of their measurable value for birds. Herein, we define and identify singular point elements in the agricultural landscape (SPELs) which are potentially important for breeding farmland birds. We also describe each SPEL and evaluate its importance for birds in farmland based on a systematic review of the available literature. Using a horizon-scanning technique, we then polled field ornithologists about their personal observations of birds in relation to SPELs and the evaluation of the potential roles of such structures for birds. We identified 17 SPELs that vary in naturalness and age: singular trees, singular shrubs, erratic boulders, puddles, electricity pylons, wind turbines, spiritual sites, hunting platforms, fence and border posts, wells, road signs, scarecrows, piles of manure, piles of brushwood/branches, piles of stones/debris, piles of lime, and haystacks. Analysis of the literature revealed knowledge gaps, because some SPELs are frequently mentioned in ecological studies (e.g. trees, shrubs, pylons), but others such as spiritual sites, stones, hunting platforms, wells, road signs, or piles of lime are ignored. Despite the fact that some authors incorporate the effects of some SPELs in their studies, little research to date has aimed to assess the impact of various SPELs on farmland bird species numbers and distribution. Horizon scanning revealed that ornithologists often observe birds on various SPELs and thus, attribute to SPELs many functions that are important for maintaining bird populations. Horizon scanning also highlighted the importance of SPELs for many declining bird species and suggested possible mitigation of negative changes in the agricultural landscape by retaining SPELs within fields. We suggest that a better understanding of the role of SPELs for farmland birds is required. We also recommend that SPELs are considered as a potential tool for the conservation of birds, and existing conservation programs such as agri-environment-climate schemes and organic farming should be updated accordingly. Finally, we suggest that SPELs are included in predictive models that evaluate habitat suitability for farmland biodiversity. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are widely used to allow for safe animal movement across roads, promoting both human safety and wildlife conservation. These structures are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore cost-effective design is essential. Although there has been much research to date on the factors affecting the usage of WCS by wildlife, no attempt has been made to synthesize these results and assess the current state of knowledge. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific and professional literature to assess the state of empirical evidence on WCS and a meta-analysis to explore the factors that influence their effectiveness. We identified a total of 270 studies that reported empirical results spanning four decades of research. Most studies (161) measured the number of crossing events without monitoring approaches to the structure, thus limiting the ability to assess WCS effectiveness. Only 77 studies measured the proportion of successful crossings to approaches, which was the type of data used for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results show that viaducts are the most effective type of WCS for large mammals. For example, the odds of ungulates crossing through a viaduct are 2.9 times that of an overpass, and 3.6 times that of an underpass. WCS built specifically for wildlife are used significantly more than those built for dual use by humans and wildlife. For large carnivores, the odds of using a dedicated WCS are 15.9 times that of a structure used concurrently by humans. We additionally found that natural materials and round shapes are preferable in the design of effective WCS. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of adopting large-scale monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. More broadly, we conclude that further research focusing on under-studied species and structure characteristics is needed to facilitate cost-effective mitigation efforts that reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and promote wildlife conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban areas represent a spectrum that goes from being safe habitats for biodiversity (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, without costs to fitness) to being ecological traps (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, but with costs to fitness). Given the imminent urban expansion, it is valuable to assess how biodiversity is responding to urbanization and thus generate timely conservation strategies. We systematically review the urban ecology literature to analyze how much do we know about the role of urban areas as ecological traps. Using a formal meta-analytical approach, we test whether urban areas are functioning as ecological traps or as safe habitats for different taxonomic groups. We generated a data set of 646 effect sizes of different measures of habitat preferences and fitness from 38 papers published between 1985 and 2020. The data set covered 15 countries and 47 urban areas from four continents, including 29 animal species. Studies from North America and Europe were best represented, and birds were the most studied taxa. Overall, the meta-analysis suggests that urbanized habitats are functioning more as safe sites than as ecological traps, mainly for certain species with characteristics that have allowed them to adapt well to urban areas. That is, many of the studied species prefer more urbanized habitats over other less urbanized sites, and their fitness is not modified, or it is even increased. However, there was high heterogeneity among studies. We also performed meta-regressions to identify variables accounting for this heterogeneity across studies and we demonstrate that outcomes may depend on methodological aspects of studies, such as study design or the approach used to measure habitat preference and fitness. More research is needed for poorly studied regions and on a wider range of species before generalizations can be made on the role of urban areas for biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
AB  - Planting flowers along crop field edges is an increasingly common management strategy for addressing pollinator declines and improving crop pollination. However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4–29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery. Determining if field-edge plantings affect pollinator population growth may clarify how plantings improve crop pollination, while further research on landscape context and crop type may define when this happens. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mining activities can pose negative, sometimes irreversible damage to ecosystems, yet consequences for ecosystem services (ES) and their contribution to human wellbeing are more uncertain. Obtaining a clear understanding of where and how mining impacts ES and the methods used to show this is crucial for determining management approaches to overcome impacts. Here, we review the academic literature examining mining impacts to ES. We found only 60 papers assessed impacts to ES, with the majority focused on coal mining. Regulating services, such as carbon storage and erosion prevention, were most commonly assessed. We observed considerable variation in ES definitions and conceptualisations with no methodological consistency in ES assessments among studies. While we found negative impacts on ES were attributed to active mining operations and some positive impacts were related to restoration activities, our results also highlight major limitations to managing ES in mining regions. Assessing the full extent of impacts to ES from mining requires clear identification of changes in the ES chain – from biophysical supply to benefits and human wellbeing throughout the mining lifecycle. We propose a research agenda to address these knowledge gaps, which will help to improve pre- and post-mining ecosystem management for ES and human wellbeing. © 2020

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) to address societal challenges have been widely recognised and adopted by governments in climate change and biodiversity strategies. Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for. The recognition of the value created by these activities is essential for designing effective policy support measures, and for market development of the sector and its potential to facilitate the wider adoption of NBS. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The theme of green human resource management (GHRM) has got immense attention among researchers and professionals due to its potential to pacify environmental needs and simultaneously allowing firms to have win-win situation, hence achieving sustainable competitive edge over their rivals. In this context, a systematic review of 70 articles from the past 12 years (2008-2020) on green human resource management was conducted based on Scopus database in terms of (1) the reflections of green HRM, (2) execution of green HRM, (3) factors of green HRM, (4), Effects of green HRM. Results demonstrated that Green HRM is still in developing phase and a multidimensional paradigm with green training as an important element along with teamwork, management support, green organizational culture are the pioneer factors in ensuring sustainable development both at firm and individual level. Finally, this paper highlights the past, current and future endeavors in green HRM paradigm, sustainable development and serves as a guide for researchers who are new to this novel concept; it will also intensity their understanding about the productive journals, appropriate methodology, underpinning theories, sustainable development and substantial knowledge gaps. © 2021 WITPress.

AB  - Land-use changes, both in terms of land abandonment and intensification, have led to fragmentation and loss of traditional agricultural habitats. Extensive grazing is among the forms of land use that have undergone the greatest changes. This represents one of the main threats to biodiversity; consequently, a comprehensive overview about the impacts on the biodiversity of changes that are happening in pastoral activities is needed. Moreover, a clear picture of the most widely studied geographical areas, habitats, and taxonomic groups needs to be developed in order to understand the situation. In this framework, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the publications related to the impacts of pastoral activities on animal biodiversity in Europe. We analysed 223 articles by searching the ISI Web of Science platform and combining keywords related to “pastoral activities” and "biodiversity indicators”, applying a vote count approach, i.e. simply dividing articles into categories depending on their results (non-significant ones, significant positive results, significant negative ones). Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis on 33 articles, selecting those focusing on Arthropods (the most studied taxa). To understand the main gaps in this scientific topic, we focused on: i) the identification of the geographical, environmental, and temporal structure of the studies; ii) the description of the main target groups used as bio-indicators; iii) the comparison of different management practices (overgrazing, traditional, agri-environment schemes - AESs), plus land abandonment, to determine which is the best for biodiversity conservation and to evaluate the effectiveness of AESs. There was a bias towards lowlands in comparison to uplands, as well as a lack of long-term studies. Plants were more sensitive than animals to grazing changes. Arthropods’ orders are the taxa used most frequently as indicators, in comparison with vertebrates, especially birds. We identified a generalised negative impact of overgrazing in all the habitats and geographical areas, apparently except in mountainous shrubland. Conversely, land abandonment resulted in a negative influence on biodiversity only in the mountainous areas of southern Europe (underlining the important role of traditional activities), whereas short term abandonment had a beneficial role in central Europe, where overgrazing was more widespread. The meta-analysis suggested that arthropod richness was higher in short to mid-term abandoned pastures than under either extensive or intensive grazing systems. Finally, the effectiveness of AESs for conservation purposes was not confirmed by the vote count approach, whilst meta-analysis detected a positive effect for Arthropods of these same management practices when compared to overgrazing. We highlight a lack of data on AESs, especially when compared with traditional extensive grazing or abandonment. Our findings suggest that AES seems to effectively mimic traditional pastures, contrasting overgrazing, which is one of its main goal. Since AES have a strong potential in influencing sustainable management and promoting biodiversity conservation, the European Union should focus on the most effective and well targeted AES based on research, and further studies will be necessary to continuously assess their effect. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Limited accessibility and bias in wildlife-wind energy knowledge: A bilingual systematic review of a globally distributed bird group
AU  - Fernández-Bellon, D.
T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Wind energy is a key component of climate action strategies aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions between a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities. © 2020 The Author

TI  - Emerging zoonotic diseases originating in mammals: a systematic review of effects of anthropogenic land-use change
AU  - White, R.J.
AU  - Razgour, O.
T2  - Mammal Review
AB  - Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals. © 2020 The Authors.

T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
AB  - Background: Due to risk factors such as climate change, habitat destruction, overhunting and pollution, bird extinctions are now occurring at a rate that far exceeds their speciation rate. There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. The statistical methods which are used to model and evaluate the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using citizen science data are reviewed in this study. Citizen science data helps to increase the number of records, thereby improving our understanding of the dynamics in declining bird species populations. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines a comprehensive systematic review was performed using three databases: ProQuest Central, Scopus and Web of Science from January 1900 to January 2019. Only journal articles which analysed the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using a statistical model, predictive model or a trend analysis, developed using citizen science data were included in this study. Bird species in near threatened or least concern categories that are declining in population/range were also included, since these may be the next wave of species to be added to the endangered species lists. Results: Most of the 39 unique studies describing statistical models for this purpose used generalized linear models, followed by hierarchical/linear mixed models, machine learning models and persistence probability models respectively. A quality assessment tool was created in order to evaluate these articles. The review suggested several methods for measuring the persistence of threatened bird species, but there was no attempt to identify critical tipping points using methods such as change-point analysis. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the persistence of threatened bird species varies depending on various risk factors which need to be addressed in order to produce better outcomes for the conservation of threatened birds. This review reveals the most suitable statistical methods for this purpose. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Vineyards are experiencing strong expansion and management intensification worldwide, especially in areas with a Mediterranean climate, which are often characterized by a high conservation value. This is posing concerns about their environmental impact and it is fostering research on biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services in this agroecosystem. With this systematic review, we aim at providing a global and comprehensive overview of the current research on biodiversity and biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services in vineyards, considering the effects of landscape features and management practices. We carried out a systematic literature search on the Web of Science Core Collection database. Literature was filtered according to several criteria, resulting in a final collection of 218 papers published between 1995 and 2018 and referring to different organism groups (from microbes to vertebrates) and two spatial scales (local and landscape). The results of the studies are often contrasting and taxon- and scale-dependent, thus hindering conclusions at the global scale. However, at least three main points of practical relevance can be fixed: (i) organic viticulture weakly enhances biodiversity at the landscape scale, whereas contrasting effects have been found at the local scale; (ii) ground vegetation management by cover cropping and the conservation of native ground cover strongly promotes biodiversity; (iii) habitat heterogeneity at the landscape and local scales is a key element for biodiversity. Several studies support the view that promoting biodiversity in vineyard-dominated landscapes could also positively impact on several ecosystem services. Our study further revealed knowledge gaps that should be filled by future research. In particular, important geographical areas for wine production, as well as several organism groups, have been completely neglected. Studies at the landscape level are still scarce (specifically those addressing landscape configuration), and also the research about supporting, provisioning, and cultural biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services is still in its infancy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Human-wildlife interactions for tourism: a systematic review
AU  - Dou, X.
AU  - Day, J.
T2  - Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Insights
AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to synthesize the key findings of prior research on the topic of human-wildlife interactions (HWI) in natural places for tourism. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of systematic review was used to search for, appraise and analyze the relevant research evidence. A total of 47 English-language academic journal articles, published between 2003 and 2018, with free online access to full texts in the database of Hospitality and Tourism Complete have been reviewed. Thematic analysis was adopted to synthesize the textual data. Findings: The reviewed articles cover a wide geographical spread, diverse wildlife species and interaction types, and various research focuses including ecological impacts, human dimensions and management issues of wildlife tourism. The interactions between wildlife and human systems in the context of tourism constitute a complicated social-ecological system, in which both the humans and animals can be affected positively and negatively. Management and scientific research provide the nexus between the ecological and human dimensions of wildlife tourism. While opportunities for sustainable development abound, challenges are not to be neglected. Originality/value: Due to the complexity of wildlife encounters for tourist purposes, the extant literature indicates a diverse and fragmented view from which integrated implications are difficult to obtain. This paper presents the first overarching review in English of the literature on human-wildlife interactions for tourism and provides a big picture understanding of what has been and what is needed to be done in terms of both wildlife tourism research and practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is increasing concern about the impact of the current boom in wind energy facilities (WEF) and associated infrastructure on wildlife. However, the direct and indirect effects of these facilities on the mortality, occurrence and behaviour of rare and threatened species are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review to examine the potential impacts of WEF on grouse species. We studied whether grouse (1) collide with wind turbines, (2) show behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine developments, and (3) if there are documented effects of WEF on their population sizes or dynamics. Our review is based on 35 sources, including peer-reviewed articles as well as grey literature. Effects of wind turbine facilities on grouse have been studied for eight species. Five grouse species have been found to collide with wind turbines, in particular with the towers. Fifteen studies reported behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine facilities in grouse (seven species), including spatial avoidance, displacement of lekking or nesting sites, or the time invested in breeding vs. non-breeding behaviour. Grouse were affected at up to distances of 500 m by WEF infrastructure, with indications of effects also at bigger distances. In six cases, a local reduction in grouse abundance was reported in areas with wind turbines, which possibly affected population size. Due to the differences in study duration and design, we cannot provide general conclusions on the effects of WEF on grouse populations. We advise applying the precautionary principle by keeping grouse habitats free of wind energy developments, in particular where populations are small or locally threatened. Future studies should preferably apply a long-term before-after-control-impact design for multiple areas to allow for more general conclusions to be drawn on the effects of WEF on rare and threatened wildlife species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

AB  - Protected areas are a global cornerstone of biodiversity conservation and restoration. Yet freshwater biodiversity is continuing to decline rapidly. To date there has been no formal review of the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving or restoring biodiversity in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. We present the first assessment using a systematic review of the published scientific evidence of the effectiveness of freshwater protected areas. Systematic searches returned 2,586 separate publications, of which 44 provided quantitative evidence comprising 75 case studies. Of these, 38 reported positive, 25 neutral, and 12 negative outcomes for freshwater biodiversity conservation. Analysis revealed variable relationships between conservation effectiveness and factors such as taxa assessed, protected area size and characteristics, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) protected area category, and ecoregion. Lack of effectiveness was attributed to many anthropogenic factors, including fishing (often with a lack of law enforcement), water management (abstraction, dams, and flow regulation), habitat degradation, and invasive non-native species. Drawing on the review and wider literature we distil eight lessons to enhance the effectiveness of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation. We urge policymakers, protected area managers, and those who fund them to invest in well-designed research and monitoring programs and publication of evidence of protected area effectiveness. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats, and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference, including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial dataset, which included 70% of the studies, revealed that diversity in PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts; e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where the frequency of drying events increases. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (“DW enrichment”) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society

T2  - Environmental Evidence
AB  - Background: Since the 1960s, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and recently, social impact assessments (SIAs), have been conducted during the planning stages of large development projects to identify potential adverse effects and propose mitigation measures to ameliorate these impacts. EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible positive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, including biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https://osf.io/cvh3u/) and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text. Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts, and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitigation measures from practitioners' knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges including scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners' knowledge. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Several Andean countries have planned to restore forest cover in degraded land to enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services in response to international commitments such as the Bonn Challenge. Hydrological services, e.g. water supply, hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation, are particularly important to sustain the life of more than fifty million Andean people. While rapid and important forest cover changes have occurred during recent decades, critical information on the impact of forestation on hydrological services has not yet been synthesized in the context of Andean ecosystems. We define forestation as the establishment of forest by plantation or natural regeneration on areas that either had forest in the past or not. To help improve decision-making on forestation in the Andes, we reviewed the available literature concerning the impacts of forestation on water supply, hydrological regulation and mitigation of erosion and landslides. We also examined available data on the most relevant hydrological processes such as infiltration, evapotranspiration and runoff in forest stands. Hydrological services from native forests were also included as a reference state for comparing processes and services provided by forestation. Following systematic review protocols, we synthesized 155 studies using different methods, including meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Results show that forestation has had clear impacts on degraded soils, through reducing water erosion of soils and risk of moderate floods, increasing soil infiltration rate by 8 and topsoil organic matter (SOM). We found that 20 years of tree plantation was sufficient to recover infiltration rate and sediment yield close to the levels of native forests whereas SOM, soil water storage and surface runoff of native forests could not be recovered by forestation in the time scales examined. The benefits in terms of hydrological regulation are at the expense of a reduction in total water supply since forest cover was associated with higher water use in most Andean regions. Forestation with native species was underrepresented in the reviewed studies. The impact of forestation on landslides has also been largely overlooked in the Andes. At high elevations, exotic tree plantations on Andean grasslands (e.g. páramo and puna) had the most detrimental consequences since these grasslands showed an excellent capacity for hydrological regulation and erosion mitigation but also a water yield up to 40% higher than tree plantations. People engaged in forest restoration initiative should be aware that hydrological services may take some time for society and the environment to show clear benefits after forestation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioenergy buffers are linear landscape elements cultivated with perennial herbaceous or woody biomass crops placed along arable field margins and watercourses. This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.

TI  - Poor evidence-base for assessment of windfarm impacts on birds
AU  - Stewart, GB
AU  - Pullin, AS
AU  - Coles, CF
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Concerns about anthropogenic climate change have resulted in promotion of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy. A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distriuted windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anscriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are require. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.

TI  - Understanding the impact of hydrodynamics on coastal erosion in Latin America: a systematic review
AU  - Castillo, RV
AU  - Valdecantos, VN
AU  - del Campo, JM
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Coastal zones in Latin America support a significant regional population and are vital for providing essential ecosystem services that underpin crucial socio economic activities. However, these zones face pressing challenges, with coastal erosion being a prominent concern. Coastal erosion not only jeopardizes coastal stability but also leads to occasional loss of natural habitats. This is particularly worrisome for sandy beaches due to the consistent shoreline retreat in specific regions. Short term adverse effects of coastal erosion are often attributed to human activities. Nonetheless, the influence of hydrodynamic processes, intensified by extreme events, is gaining prominence. This is due to the combined impact of tides, waves, currents, and other factors, resulting in accelerated shoreline retreat and significant losses of infrastructure and beach areas across Latin America. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of case studies in Latin America related to coastal erosion due to hydrodynamic processes. Employing a systematic review approach, data is extracted from Scopus and Web of Science databases. From an initial dataset of 701 records, 62 records meet strict eligibility criteria. Case studies present evidence of how hydrodynamic processes interact with various factors, encompassing oceanic climatic conditions, atmospheric climatic conditions, anthropogenic influences, geomorphological and bathymetric characteristics, geological and tectonic factors, and climate change related aspects. These interactions have an immediate and significant impact on sandy beaches, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensively addressing these linkages when analyzing shoreline changes. This approach aids in identifying key erosion mechanisms and developing effective mitigation measures. Furthermore, the article provides a concise overview of data sources, tools, and methodologies identified in the case studies, spanning from field investigations to the utilization of geographic information systems and numerical models. Underscores the crucial role of international academic collaboration in coastal erosion research, facilitating the adoption of innovative methodologies from other regions, potentially offering a more comprehensive perspective in the formulation of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Finally, potential areas for future research in Latin America are explored, including the assessment of extreme event variability and its impacts on local and regional hydrodynamic processes. This aspect holds critical importance in steering future research towards scenarios that encompass economic and social considerations.

TI  - The relative importance of grazing stock type and grazing intensity for conservation of mesotrophic 'old meadow' pasture
AU  - Stewart, GB
AU  - Pullin, AS
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Unimproved neutral grasslands have declined in extent throughout Europe, especially in Britain. Some of the surviving fragments are managed as pasture but the grazing regime required to maintain their relict flora is unproven. We conducted a systematic review and analysed available data to ascertain the impact of grazing on species richness and the abundance of important plant species. We found the evidence base to be poor but with some potential for meaningful integration of existing datasets. Analyses of complementary datasets from Welsh mesotrophic grassland demonstrates that livestock type and vegetation height significantly impact on the plant community composition. However, the differences in species richness and forb abundance between livestock types are not ecologically significant, and grazing intensity appears to be more important than species of grazer. Managers must balance changes in bryophyte abundance, forb diversity and plant species richness to achieve tradeoffs appropriate to their conservation objectives. The poor evidence base necessitates flexible, site-based management and rigorous monitoring where grazing of important mesotrophic pastures is undertaken. Further evidence regarding interactions between grazing intensity and livestock type is noticeably lacking, precluding prediction regarding livestock type impacts at given stocking intensities. Lack of detailed knowledge of land-use history is a major impediment and there is little information regarding taxa other than vascular plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of land-use and management changes on cultural agroecosystem services and environmental conflicts-A global review
AU  - Hanacek, K
AU  - Rodríguez-Labajos, B
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - As an outcome of interactions and interdependencies with people, agroecosystems provide cultural ecosystem services (CES), such as traditional knowledge, recreation, and places for social gatherings. Today however, agroecosystems undergo biophysical changes because of land-use and management changes (LUMC), such as intensive agriculture, urbanisation, and land abandonment. Typically, environmental conflicts emerge between stakeholders with differing interests in land areas around the LUMC. Cumulatively, these changes and conflicts have substantial influence on the CES appreciation of the farmland, triggering different types of responses, including social mobilisation and resistance.        A comprehensive analysis of these processes was missing in the literature. Here we present a systematic review of CES provided by agroecosystems at the global level, we explore their interconnections through network analysis, and analyse the interrelation between LUMC, CES and environmental conflicts. The review includes 155 peer-reviewed articles, representing empirical data from 81 countries. Twenty main categories of CES and their subcategories delivered by agroecosystems are identified. Through the network analysis we demonstrate how CES are interrelated, with agricultural heritage as a connecting core. In a comprehensive map, we further identify which LUMC types have influence upon specific CES categories, and what are the causes, outcomes of, and responses to environmental conflicts that emerge from these processes. CES and agroecosystems cannot be seen separately from one another, as a reflection of secular or recently-created relationships people have with their environments. While these relationships are dynamic, LUMC may lead to their impairment or even loss, with ensuing impacts on biocultural diversity. The resulting environmental conflicts push most frequently for greater participation of actors involved in farming, socio-cultural revalorisation of farmland activities and the promotion of multi-functionality.

TI  - The Protective Role of Coastal Marshes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
AU  - Shepard, CC
AU  - Crain, CM
AU  - Beck, MW
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Salt marshes lie between many human communities and the coast and have been presumed to protect these communities from coastal hazards by providing important ecosystem services. However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services.        Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas.        Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.

AU  - Chamberlain, DE
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization during recent decades are having dramatic effects on urban soil properties and lead to large discharges of pollutants, which inevitably affect the health of the soil, ecosystems and human populations. This paper provides a systematic review of the relations between urban soil and human health. First, it summarizes the organic and inorganic pollutants in urban soil and their potential risks to human health. Second, the relations between urban greenbelt land, soil microbial diversity and human health are also explored. Third, we propose that future research should focus on the integration of assessments of health risks with exposure pathways and site characteristics. Bioavailability-based risk assessment frameworks for pollutants in urban soil can elucidate the complicated relations between urban soil, pollutant exposure and human health in cities. Finally, management of urban soil and policy should be strengthened in the future to maintain its sustainable development and utilization. More effort should be directed to understanding the relations between soil microbial diversity, green space and human health in cities.

TI  - Effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity: A meta-analysis of grouse populations
AU  - Dettenmaier, SJ
AU  - Messmer, TA
AU  - Hovick, TJ
AU  - Dahlgren, DK
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Livestock grazing affects over 60% of the world's agricultural lands and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity. Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.

AU  - Sweaney, N
AU  - Lindenmayer, DB
AU  - Driscoll, DA
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - The quality and extent of the 'matrix' in terrestrial fragmented landscapes may influence the persistence and behaviour of patch-associated fauna. Butterflies are a popular target group for fragmentation studies and represent an ideal assemblage to explore the impact and role of the matrix in patchy landscapes. To date, there has been no attempt to synthesise available research and assess the extent to which the matrix is included in studies of fragmented butterfly populations. Addressing this issue is important for improved understanding of habitat use in fragmented landscapes, and for the successful management and conservation of butterfly biodiversity. Our systematic review of 100 empirical research papers spans 50 years, and identifies how (and indeed if) the matrix is recognised in studies of butterfly populations in fragmented landscapes. We found that it was significantly more likely for studies not to include the matrix in their experimental design. This is of particular concern given 60 % of papers that excluded the matrix in their research did so in systems where the matrix was expected to contain resources of value for patch-associated species (as it was either a heterogeneous landscape or had similar structure to patches). Of the papers that did consider the matrix, 80 % (n = 24) reported a negative effect of the matrix on butterfly species and/or communities. Matrix effects may influence the survival and persistence of faunal groups in a world increasingly dominated by fragmented habitats. Our review suggests that future research should clearly define the matrix, and incorporate it in appropriate experimental designs.

AU  - de Abreu, MR
AU  - Machado, RL
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The biofuel supply chain (BSC) management has received considerable attention in recent years for diversifying the energy matrix and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, despite the robust body of literature in studies addressing sustainable management and optimization, research integrating scarce resources in the production process still needs to be developed. Also, problems concerning the basic demands of water, energy, food, and land (WEFL) involve different levels of decision-making, multiple scales, and numerous stake-holders with different objectives. The synergistic management of these resources is called WEFL Nexus approach and constitutes one of the most complex sustainability challenges. Understanding the practical contributions of each dimension of the WEFL Nexus approach to biofuel supply chain management can make the concept more accessible to decision-makers and enable the formulation of practical and implementable programs. Based on this analysis, this article presents a systematic literature review and a meta-synthesis to highlight how the nexus approach contributes to the sustainable management of the biofuel supply chain. The results obtained in the research show that the WEFL Nexus approach can provide social and economic solutions for managing BSCs through the diversification of energy biomass sources, decontamination, use of wastewater, choosing the most appropriate locations for planting and installations according to geography, climate, and society, and meeting regional social demands for resources. Furthermore, this research shows that it is possible to optimize the use of resources while production flows are optimized.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The concept of Woodland Key Habitats (WKH, small-scaled presumed hotspots of biodiversity) has become an essential component of biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian and Baltic forests. There have been debates over the importance of WKHs in relation to the conservation of biodiversity in production forests. We applied a systematic review protocol and meta-analysis to summarize knowledge on comparisons of biodiversity qualities, such as dead wood and species richness, between WKHs and production forests in relevant countries. We also summarized the knowledge on the impact of edge effects by comparing WKHs surrounded by production forests to WKHs surrounded by clear cuts. Studies had been conducted in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on our meta-analysis, WKHs seem to be relative hotspots for dead wood volume, diversity of dead wood, number of species and number of red-listed species. There were some differences also between countries in these biodiversity qualities. Only two studies compared WKHs surrounded by production forests and clear cuts, respectively. Hence, the capability of WKHs to maintain their original species composition and support species persistence over time remains to be addressed, as well as their role in relation to other conservation tools.

AU  - Colsaet, A

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land take is the transformation of agricultural, natural and semi-natural spaces into urban and other artificial uses. It is closely linked to urban sprawl (low-density or dispersed urban development). Land take is a major environmental challenge, especially for biodiversity conservation, as it destroys and fragments natural habitats.        In order to assess how the scientific literature dedicated to this topic adresses the determinants of land take, we analyzed 193 scientific articles retrieved through a systematic methodology.        We summarized the causal relationships identified between land take and different explanatory factors. Among them, population and income growth, as well as the development of transport infrastructure and automobile use, are widely studied drivers that are most often found to increase land take. Political and institutional factors are extensively mentionned in the literature, suggesting that urban sprawl is not a mere result of "market forces" but is also shaped though public policies. Weak or unadequate planning, subsidies for land consumption and automobile transportation are said to increase urban sprawl, while infrastructure pricing and subsidies for urban renewal would have the opposite effect. The institutional setting, especially administrative fragmentation, reliance on local taxes, and competition between local jurisdictions, is suspected to be a major determinant of land take. The effect of many factors however remains relatively undocumented or controversial in the reviewed literature, including widely used policy instruments.

TI  - How different ethno-cultural groups value urban forests and its implications for managing urban nature in a multicultural landscape: A systematic review of the literature
AU  - Ordóñez-Barona, C
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB  - Understanding how different ethno-cultural groups value urban nature is important to understand the role of ethno-cultural diversity in urban ecosystem management. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper summarizes the empirical evidence on how different ethno-cultural groups use, perceive, prefer, and assign meaning to urban nature. I use the urban forest, defined here as all the trees in a city, as a proxy to understand this process. The 31 studies reviewed here differ widely in their lines of inquiry, research methods, urban natural setting, and conceptualizations of ethno-cultural identity. Most studies take place in the US and Europe, where the most common definition of an ethno-culturally diverse group is a person of non-European/non-White background. Most studies focus on what these groups like about a particular urban natural setting, such as an urban park; and whether they like more or less trees in a specific context (e.g. urban park). These groups usually prefer passive and social uses of urban natural areas, and more manicured/functional natural landscapes with less trees. The most common meanings associated with urban natural settings dominated by trees are social interaction and integration. The most common explanations on why these differences occur involve theories on socio-economic marginality, collectivist vs. individualist cultures, urban vs. rural lifestyles, and landscapes of origin. Future research on the topic will benefit by differentiating race from ethnicity, capturing intra-ethnic variation, capturing immigrant identities, exploring the different social, cultural, and economic factors that influence values and/or preferences, and focusing on concrete aspects of urban nature, such as urban forests.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Intensification of agriculture and ongoing urban sprawl exacerbate pressures on rivers. Small rivers in agricultural landscapes are especially exposed to excessive technical actions implemented in order to allow for harvesting river water for irrigation, draining agricultural water and receiving sewage. Regular dredging and macrophyte removal strongly interfere with the global need for preserving river biodiversity that allows agricultural lowland rivers to remain refuges for a variety of species, and-accordingly-to keep water bodies resilient for the benefit of society. In order to provide a comprehensive look at the influence of agricultural lowland river management on the ecological status of these water bodies, we conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis. For the structured literature review we selected 203 papers reflecting on the response of aquatic ecosystems to dredging and macrophyte management actions. The database of scientific contributions developed for our study consists of papers written by the authors from 33 countries (first authorship) addressing dredging, macrophyte removal, status of fish and macroinvertebrates as well as the general ecological status of lowland agricultural rivers. We revealed that 96% of the analyzed papers indicated unilateral, negative responses of aquatic ecosystems, particularly macroinvertebrates, ichthyofauna and macrophyte composition, to maintenance measures. We revealed that studies conducted in the European Union on the ecological status of rivers appeared to significantly increase in quantity after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Finally, we concluded that day-to-day management of lowland agricultural rivers requires revision in terms of compliance with environmental conservation requirements and the recurrent implementation of technical measures for river maintenance.

AB  - Different components of global change (e.g., climate change, land use, pollution, and introduced species) continue to alter biodiversity worldwide. As northern regions are still relatively undisturbed and will likely face clear increases in temperature in the near-future, we examined the signs of biodiversity change due to anthropogenic stressors using a systematic review of previous studies. Our aim was to map where, in which way, and owing to which stressor biodiversity in northern regions has changed. We made a systematic literature search covering the years between 2000 and 2015 to obtain a comprehensive selection of recent research. As species richness was clearly the most commonly used indicator of biodiversity, we only concentrated on this aspect of biodiversity. We compared different biological groups, regions, and ecosystems. In the majority of the cases, anthropogenic stressors had decreased species richness, or had no effects on it, while increasing or multiple effects of stressors on species richness were less common. Freshwater ecosystems were most sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, as species richness often decreased owing to these stressors. The effects of land use on richness were covered relatively widely in the selected set of articles, but the effects of other components of global change on species richness require further attention. Despite the fact that pollution was not as commonly studied stressor as land use, it was the most harmful stressor type affecting species richness. Geographically, most studies were located in boreal Canada or Fennoscandia, while no studies were executed in vast circumpolar areas where the temperature rise has been greatest and the projected climate change is likely to be fast. Overall, we could find an alarmingly small set of studies that described the effects of actual anthropogenic stressors in real-life circumstances in northern high latitudes.

AU  - Verheyen, K

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity.        Methods: This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website.        Results: Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively.        Conclusions: This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.

AU  - Gustafsson, L

AU  - Sverdrup-Thygeson, A
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, it has been common practice to leave trees for biodiversity purposes when clear-cutting in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and regulations for such tree retention are today included in national legislation and certification standards. Peer-reviewed research publications on tree retention from studies performed in the three countries were analyzed and about 50 relevant biodiversity studies were found, with the first published in 1994. Most studies were directed towards beetles and dead wood, especially high stumps. General conclusions were that retention trees (1) provide some of the substrate types required by early-successional species, (2) alleviate the most serious consequences of clear-cutting on biota, and (3) cannot maintain characteristics of intact mature forests. Larger volumes and more trees tend to maintain diversity better. There is a particular lack of studies on dispersal, landscape effects and long-term dynamics. There is a need to study further the relationship between the biota and the amount of trees, as well as their spatial arrangement. Retention trees should preferably be evaluated in relation to other components in multiscaled conservation, including woodland key habitats and larger protected areas.

TI  - Mites (Acari) as indicators of soil biodiversity and land use monitoring: A review
AU  - Gulvik, ME
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil is an important component for monitoring of sustainability of land use in relation to both the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity of ecosystems. Recently research has focused on the role of mites (Acari) in biomonitoring and their importance as soil bioindicators. Mite communities are extremely sensitive to all types of soil disturbance. This article presents a review of some studies on mite communities in order to discuss whether the diversity and numbers of mites present in the soil can reflect human impact on ecosystems and landscape, and whether mites can be used in monitoring systems. Limited data available about mite communities in agricultural ecosystems (in use and abandoned) in SW Norway from author's own studies (published and in prep.) are compared with data from ca. 55 papers (mostly concerning Europe). IT was concluded that: (1) Most oribatid mites with their long life span, low fecundity, slow development and low dispersion ability can be a robust indicator of the environment. Changes in the dominance structure of mite communities (Oribatida to Actinedida ratio) are suggested to be an 'early warnings criterion for stressed mite communities. (2) Both the number of species and the percentage abundance of Nothroidea and Ptyctimina decrease following human impact on the landscape. Even if individuals cannot be determined to species levels (e.g. Ptyctimina), the percent contribution and frequency of these taxa in relation to stress gradient (input levels) within the landscape provide valuable data. (3) Tectocepheus velatus (Michael 1880) and other oribatid taxa with a similar life-history strategy should be evaluated as potential bioindicators for impoverished ecosystems. (4) National and local reference data sets on the biodiversity of mite communities in diverse habitats and along stress gradients need to be collected. (5) Residual natural and semi-natural habitats (such as old woodlands, riparian ecosystems, old hedges and grasslands) with species-rich mite communities found in rural and urban landscapes should be preserved as refuges for dispersion of soil fauna. (6) Comparison of mite communities in traditional, low-input farmland in Norway with those from human-dominated landscape in other European countries can contribute to a better understanding of how human activity alters biodiversity along land-use gradients. This will aid the development of a soil bioindicator system. (7) There is a need to develop standardised procedures for the collection of samples and analyses of data sets adapted to ecological soil acarology.

TI  - Edaphic arthropods as indicators of the ecological condition of temperate grassland ecosystems: A systematic review
AU  - Solascasas, Paula; Azcárate, Francisco M.; Hevia, Violeta
T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - Temperate grasslands are part of one of the biggest biomes on earth, sustaining high levels of biodiversity and providing multiple ecosystem services. However, the area covered by this open ecosystem is decreasing worldwide, due to several threats like land use change or climate change. Ground-dwelling arthropods are an important group of the community of grassland soil invertebrates, and they play a key role within this ecosystem, while at the same time being sensitive to the changes caused by management practices like grazing, mowing, prescribed fire, etc. Using the Web of Science database, we conducted a systematic review to identify which groups of arthropods are being used as indicators to evaluate the ecological condition of grasslands in temperate regions, and which indices are being measured. As grasslands have been traditionally managed by humans for centuries, their ecological condition is intrinsically linked to the development of different management practices like grazing, mowing or restoration strategies, which usually affect soil and vegetation structure. We found that macro-arthropods were used in a greater number of studies than micro-arthropods (91% vs 15%), and within that size group, beetles were the preferred indicator in most of the temperate grassland types (49% of the studies), followed by spiders and ants. Few studies used grasshoppers to monitor grasslands changes. The indices more frequently assessed were species richness and abundance, and we identified that the response to the different management practices was quite heterogeneous. Restoration and grazing effects were the two factors more frequently evaluated for macro-arthropods, while micro-arthropods (Acari and Collembola) were dominant to assess land use type. Overall, our findings highlight the need to increase the number of studies in some temperate regions, to explore the potential of overlooked groups of arthropods, and to include indices that measure functional diversity or community composition.

TI  - A systematic review on the effectiveness of crop architecture-related in-field measures for promoting ground-breeding farmland birds
AU  - Blösch, S.

AU  - Zellweger-Fischer, J.
AU  - Knop, E.
T2  - Journal for Nature Conservation
AB  - Ground-breeding farmland birds are disproportionately negatively affected by the impact of agricultural intensification and mostly still dramatically declining in Europe. One main reason for this decline is the lack of suitable nesting sites. While some off-field measures showed positive effects on bird productivity, we are currently not achieving sufficient conservation with these, so that supplementing them with in-field measures seems inevitable. Over the past years, several in-field measures have been developed aiming at providing suitable nesting sites in crop fields by manipulating the crop architecture, i.e., the density and/or height of the crops. However, we currently lack an overview on what has been tested and resulted in stabilizing population of ground-breeding farmland birds. In this systematic review, we provide a qualitative assessment of current knowledge and knowledge gaps on such in-field measures and their effects on European crop-breeding farmland birds. In doing so, we accounted for specific birds’ requirements on their breeding habitat. We found only very few studies on the effectiveness of crop architecture-related in-field measures on ground-breeding farmland birds. Knowledge gaps exist for effects on individual species in general, their reproduction (rather than population density), the influence of landscape and local contexts on the effectiveness, and the optimal spatial arrangement of measures to maximize their efficiency. This shows an urgent need for more research on a holistic scale. However, the few existing studies suggest, that there is a high potential for crop architecture-related in-field measures to promote ground-breeding farmland birds, and thus bring them back as ‘agricultural by-products’. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are globally important environmental management tools against the effects of human activities, as they support the conservation of marine biodiversity, habitats, ecosystems and the processes within them, as well as resources in a broad sense. However, the application of Ecosystem Services (ESs) research in the environmental management of PAs has not been elucidated and it still has obvious shortcomings. Here, we present the first systematic review of studies that have assessed the application of ES research in PAs, evaluated the beneficial evidence of using ES for PA management, and identified research gaps to be addressed for future work. The majority of the 84 studies examined were conducted in Europe (44.44%) and Asia (30.77%), and they primarily examined cultural and provisioning ESs. Most case studies focused on methodological design and lacked an understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of ESs and of the interaction between ESs and management decisions in PAs. Future studies of PAs should (1) identify the main ESs provided, (2) improve ESs assessment methods and data acquisition capabilities, and (3) assess how pressures from outside the boundaries of PAs affect their ability to maintain biodiversity and ESs in the long term. © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Journal of Flood Risk Management
AB  - The Pitt Review of the 2007 summer floods in the UK, published in 2008, commended the potential of natural flood management (NFM) for reducing flood risk. NFM is a nature-based approach that has since gained substantial interest from both practitioners and academics. The review further highlighted the need for catchment-based flood management (CBFM) to enhance resilience to flooding and climate change by incorporating NFM and wider nature-based solutions into hard flood protection systems. Such integrated approaches are considered to be more sustainable and adaptable than the traditional hard-engineered measures. More recently, the European Commission's European Green Deal also highlighted the need for greater use of nature-based solutions including NFM for managing flood risk. Whilst there have been many attempts to quantify the effects of NFM through hydraulic and hydrological modelling, there is still no systematic review conducted for these modelling works. This review aims to summarise the current NFM modelling approaches, as well as discussing their key limitations related to data, model methods, and real-world applications. This paper then goes further to highlight potential solutions to some of these challenges and provides guidance to assist modellers to improve future modelling and data collection process. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Biodiversity in temperate silvoarable systems: A systematic review

T2  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
AB  - Silvoarable systems (SAS) are agroforestry systems (AFS) that combine the cultivation of trees and arable crops. Often, rows of trees delineate crop alleys in a field (alley-cropping system). SAS have the potential to provide many agricultural and environmental benefits, are innovative in their modern form, and are becoming more widespread. These diversified farming systems have the potential to influence biodiversity and related ecosystem services (ES). This systematic review seeks to assess the link between temperate SAS and biodiversity at all main taxonomical levels (bacteria and fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). We describe the response of biodiversity in terms of abundance, species richness and other diversity indices. This study concerns not only the potential interest of these systems for biodiversity conservation, but also the impacts of living organisms present in the system on ES and eventually ecosystem disservices. We obtained 3458 references dealing with both agroforestry and biodiversity from the Web of Sciences database. Among them, 45 articles corresponded to our specific subject and met the selection criteria. These publications were retained for further analysis. SAS have a positive impact on biodiversity conservation by increasing the abundance or diversity of the different taxonomic groups. Regarding ES, the few papers that studied the effect on pollinators or pollination also showed a positive effect. The majority of studies on natural predators and biocontrol and most of those concerning soil organisms and related supporting services showed a positive effect of SAS. However, some studies found no positive effect or even reported a negative effect in specific conditions. Data is limited for weeds, pests and damage to crop production, and results contrast according to studies and conditions. The review lists the different parameters that influence biodiversity and the subsequent services. These parameters can be divided into three main groups, namely crop management, the influence of the crop location, and agroforestry management. We also report the influence of the experimental design, for example the use of control and comparison or sampling methods. Moreover, the link with other ES is discussed (mainly in terms of provisioning but also for cultural services). Finally, we suggest future research avenues and propose advice in line with the issues discussed in this work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - After drainage for forestry and agriculture, peat extraction is one of the most important causes of peatland degradation. When peat extraction is ceased, multiple after-use options exist, including abandonment, restoration, and replacement (e.g., forestry and agricultural use). However, there is a lack of a global synthesis of after-use research. Through a systematic review of 356 peer-reviewed scientific articles, we address this research gap and examine (1) what after-use options have been studied, (2) what the studied and recognized impacts of the after-use options are, and (3) what one can learn in terms of best practices and research gaps. The research has concentrated on the impacts of restoration (N = 162), abandonment (N = 72), and replacement (N = 94), the latter of which consists of afforestation (N = 46), cultivation (N = 34) and creation of water bodies (N = 14). The studies on abandonment, restoration, and creation of water bodies have focused mostly on analyzing vegetation and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, while the studies assessing afforestation and cultivation sites mostly evaluate the provisioning ecosystem services. The studies show that active restoration measures speed-up vegetation recolonization on bare peat areas, reduce GHG emissions and decrease negative impacts on water systems. The most notable research gap is the lack of studies comparing the environmental and social impacts of the after-use options. Additionally, there is a lack of studies focusing on social impacts and downstream hydrology, as well as long-term monitoring of GHG fluxes. Based on the reviewed studies, a comparison of the impacts of the after-use options is not straightforward. We emphasize a need for comparative empirical research in the extracted sites with a broad socio-ecological and geographical context. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Ecological Impacts of Exotic Species on Native Seed Dispersal Systems: A Systematic Review

T2  - Plants
AB  - Exotic species are one of the main threats to biodiversity, leading to alterations in the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems. However, they can sometimes also provide ecological services, such as seed dispersal. Therefore, we assessed the ecological impacts of exotic species on native dispersal systems and the mechanisms underlying the disruption of mutualistic plant–disperser interactions. Exotic species negatively affect dispersal mutualisms by (i) altering dispersal behavior and visitation rates of native dispersers, (ii) predating native dispersers, (iii) transmitting forest pathogens, and (iv) predating seeds. Conversely, positive impacts include the dispersal of native plants, forest regeneration, and native habitat restoration via (i) increasing the visitation rates of frugivorous birds, (ii) facilitating the colonization and establishment of native forest trees, (iii) enhancing forest species seedling survival, and (iv) facilitating seed rain and seedling recruitment of early and late successional native plants. The reviewed studies provide similar results in some cases and opposite results in others, even within the same taxa. In almost all cases, exotic species cause negative impacts, although sometimes they are necessary to ensure native species’ persistence. Therefore, exotic species management requires a comprehensive understanding of their ecological roles, since the resulting effects rely on the complexity of native–exotic species interactions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The degradation of ecosystems threatens the provision of ecosystem services and limits human well-being. This systematic literature review evaluates the threats surrounding cultural ecosystem services (CES), namely recreation and landscape aesthetics in European permanent grasslands. We identified underlying causes, direct threats, consequences and suggested solutions for threat mitigation. The most common threats were land-use and management change processes, followed by social attitude, industrial developments and natural threats. However, recreational activities also created negative feedback, affecting the ecosystem, biodiversity and CES, most frequently in the form of various touristic activities. Suggested solutions were most commonly socio-economic and institutional measures to enhance rural communities, as well as improving communication with relevant stakeholders. CES play a crucial role in reconnecting people with nature, and their consequent acknowledgement and incorporation into future ecosystem service frameworks and agri-environmental policy developments are key elements in supporting future sustainable grassland management. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition? Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Review findings: During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests. Conclusions: The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies. Therefore, generalization of the results must be done carefully. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Human has been evolving in a natural environment over a long time; thus, he is habitual to adapt it. Green spaces are obligatory landscapes in an urban structure that provide a natural environment and accelerate other life events. In contrast, unplanned urbanization, and conversion from green to grey structures have damaged natural environmental resources. Studies through different angles have highlighted the importance of urban green spaces for human well-being but now need to identify their role according to the potential. The demands of urban green spaces may differ with the change of population size, types of grey structure, urban expansion, the altitude of the place, and geographical location. Therefore, this systematic review aims to analyse the significance of urban green spaces for human well-being. The study opted for a systematic process during the selection and organization of studies for this review. After analysing, 46 studies were finalized with the consensus of three review authors. Accordingly, literature was analysed under the central theme of “Urban Green Spaces for Human Well-being.” Human Well-being was assessed under six sub-themes; physical, psychological, mental, social, subjective, and environmental well-being. The review concluded that urban green spaces are the primary pillar for a sustainable urban place and human well-being due to highly positive and positive correlations. Moreover, the study did not find any demarcation line between green spaces and grey structures according to any specific need. Therefore, the study suggested that the role of urban green spaces for human well-being should be analysed according to their potential and required optimal ratio under different communities’ urban specific environments and social behaviour. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) supply several ecosystem services (ES) key to human wellbeing. In this article, we conducted a systematic review focused on identifying UGS's ES and wellbeing dimensions. From the 3626 articles screened, 218 were used in this review. Most studies were conducted in Europe, China, the United States of America (USA) and South Africa. Among all UGS, parks and gardens were the most investigated, with less of a focus on urban trees, forests, coastal mangroves, golf courses, roadside vegetation, and brownfields/unmanaged urban greenery. Cultural ES were the most studied, although it is well known that UGS also supply many provisioning and regulating ES. Health (mental and physical) and good social relations were the most investigated wellbeing dimensions, and food security received the least attention. Regarding the methodologies used to investigate the UGS contribution to human wellbeing, surveys, indicators, and surveys combined with statistical methods were the most common. Only a few works focusing on spatial modelling were validated, which is critical to ensure the reliability of the spatial models applied to UGS ES studies. Overall, this work identified the research gaps and future perspectives in ES and wellbeing dimensions provided by UGS, key to improving further research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment
AB  - Linear Transport Infrastructure (LTI) often has important impacts on wildlife and landscape processes. Two reviews provided early insight and nuance into LTI impacts on birdlife but were published when road ecology experiments were still being developed. Four factors were identified to impact birds near roads: habitat quality, species-specific traits, traffic noise, and infrastructure. Although early work identified traffic noise as the main selective force, recent studies lend more support to habitat quality and infrastructure. However, this literature was deemed to possess low inferential strength given inconsistent data collection, inadequate management of confounding variables, limited inclusion of vehicle-free environments, short-term experimental timeframes, and use of methodologies susceptible to bias. A new experimental framework for better evaluation of the impact of roads on birdlife is proposed. This would facilitate the construction of species and/or community profiles useful in the design, construction, and management of transport networks. © 2022

T2  - Environmental Development
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is a complex, multidimensional and non-linear global phenomenon driven by multiple factors and with contrasting impacts on agrobiodiversity, environment and society. A comprehensive overview of agricultural land abandonment provides an understanding of how the issue is emerging globally, the impacts it has caused and pathways that could halt the negative impacts. This study reviews the drivers and consequences of agricultural land abandonment and pathways for the reutilisation of abandoned agricultural lands. The 124 relevant articles used in this review were retrieved systematically from CAB Abstracts, Scopus and Web of Science, applying exclusion and inclusion criteria in line with standard protocols. The spatial and temporal diversity of the selected articles indicates that the majority of studies were conducted in European (64 articles) and Asian countries (44 articles). Although farmland abandonment has received research attention from the early 1990s, about 95% of the articles were published only in the last 15 years. In the case of Asian countries, almost all of the studies took place after 2014. Broadly, seven categories of drivers (demographic, household characteristics, farm characteristics, biophysical, economic, regulatory and socio-political) were responsible for agricultural land abandonment. This study found that land abandonment has both positive and negative consequences on several abiotic and biotic components of the landscape. However, negative consequences were most frequently reported compared to positive consequences, especially for agrobiodiversity and rural household livelihoods and communities. Positive impacts included enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. Few studies have discussed possible pathways for reutilisation of abandoned farmland. Productive reutilisation options included various farm-forest and afforestation systems, communal land management and high-value crop production. Research gaps included a framework for defining and measuring abandonment; multidisciplinary analyses of drivers and consequences; intrinsic (behavioural, cultural and geopolitical) factors affecting abandonment; and building capacity for alternative local land use options. This review provides a valuable starting point for rural development stakeholders to identify where future research is required and provides knowledge about the trade-offs and opportunities associated with land abandonment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - The ability for urban ecosystems to deliver provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services is vital for the health, sustainability, and resilience of urban environments. The increasing pressures being placed on urban environments by global climate change and the need to create sustainable food systems contributes to rising interest in green infrastructure and urban agriculture solutions. Yet, few studies have systematically assessed the ecosystem service provision of urban agriculture and green infrastructure in parallel. In this systematic review of 157 peer-reviewed journal articles, we synthesize the benefits and disbenefits of implementing various forms of urban agriculture and green infrastructure for the delivery of ecosystem services in urban areas. While both provide a diverse variety of ecosystem services, our review suggests that some services are provided more prevalently when green infrastructure is solely adopted (e.g., Local Climate and Air Quality Regulation), while other services are best delivered when green infrastructure is combined with urban agriculture (e.g., Biological Control and Maintenance of Genetic Diversity). Our data also show that ecosystem service delivery is partly modulated by the spaces in which urban growing takes place. Community Gardens, Green Spaces, Allotments, and Parks are found to be most conducive for diverse service provision, although it is also clear that some growing spaces have not been studied as frequently in urban ecosystem service research. We conclude by highlighting some key research gaps and priorities for urban ecosystem service research, including a stronger focus on under-represented services and growing spaces, the need for more systematic data collection, and the value of incorporating ecosystem service assessments into wider suitability and cost-benefit analyses. © 2022 The Authors

T2  - Journal of Resources and Ecology
AB  - Ecosystem services have rapidly changed at the global and regional scales in recent years. Exploring the driving mechanisms of ecosystem services change and projecting future change are of increasing importance to inform policy and decision-making options for ecosystem conservation and sustainable use. Although some research has analyzed the influences of land use or climate changes on ecosystem services, a systematic review on the mechanisms of ecosystem services change has not been carried out so far. This work elaborated on the mechanisms of ecosystem services change based on a literature review, and reached four main conclusions. (1) Climate change and land use jointly determine the ecosystem services change through complex and interacting pathways. (2) Whereas the present research progresses mainly focus on the identification of a single influencing factor, they fail in the determination of multiple influencing factors. (3) Although multi-scenario simulations based on remote sensing and climate models are the main means used to predict future changes in ecosystem services, clarifying the interactive mechanisms of multiple factors is the precondition for future projection of ecosystem services change; (4) Therefore, future research should strengthen the analysis and simulation of the effects of human activities on ecosystem services, especially the development of technology to detect the dynamic responses of ecosystem services to major ecological projects, which is crucial to the selection of restoration measures and the regional arrangement of ecosystem conservation projects. © 2022, Science Press.

AB  - The study of ecosystem services (ES) is becoming increasingly popular, as it plays an important role in human wellbeing, economic growth, and livelihoods. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the global trend in ES research using a rigorous systematic review of highly cited articles. The articles for this study were extracted from Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) covering the period from 2000 to 2020. This study was limited to SCI-E, ESCI, and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The term “ecosystem service/s” has been used as a research term to filter the study sample and eliminate other databases from the analysis. A citation level equal to or greater than 200 was used to further filtration of articles. This query could restrict to 128 articles that are highly cited in the selected period. Bibliometric analysis results show that, according to the author’s keywords, the “ecosystem service/s” keyword is highly connected to the “biodiversity”, “valuation”, “marine spatial planning”, and “conservation planning”. The U.S.A., Canada, China, France, and Australia are the leading countries in the cumulative number of highly cited articles and networks of co-authors. The U.S.A. is a strong contributor to ES research with China, Canada, and France. The most productive universities linked to the United States were the University of Minnesota, the University of California-Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara), and the Chinese Academy of Science. The most significant and compelling author is Halpern S Benjamin, who represents UC Santa Barbara. He has earned international recognition for a model he developed to analyze global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change in marine environments. The most accessed and studied fields in the ES are terrestrial, urban, and marine environments. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial refuges are human-made structures that aim to create safe places for animals to breed, hibernate, or take shelter in lieu of natural refuges. Artificial refuges are used across the globe to mitigate the impacts of a variety of threats on wildlife, such as habitat loss and degradation. However, there is little understanding of the science underpinning artificial refuges, and what comprises best practice for artificial refuge design and implementation for wildlife conservation. We address this gap by undertaking a systematic review of the current state of artificial refuge research for the conservation of wildlife. We identified 224 studies of artificial refuges being implemented in the field to conserve wildlife species. The current literature on artificial refuges is dominated by studies of arboreal species, primarily birds and bats. Threatening processes addressed by artificial refuges were biological resource use (26%), invasive or problematic species (20%), and agriculture (15%), yet few studies examined artificial refuges specifically for threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) species (7%). Studies often reported the characteristics of artificial refuges (i.e. refuge size, construction materials; 87%) and surrounding vegetation (35%), but fewer studies measured the thermal properties of artificial refuges (18%), predator activity (17%), or food availability (3%). Almost all studies measured occupancy of the artificial refuges by target species (98%), and over half measured breeding activity (54%), whereas fewer included more detailed measures of fitness, such as breeding productivity (34%) or animal body condition (4%). Evaluating the benefits and impacts of artificial refuges requires sound experimental design, but only 39% of studies compared artificial refuges to experimental controls, and only 10% of studies used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. As a consequence, few studies of artificial refuges can determine their overall effect on individuals or populations. We outline a series of key steps in the design, implementation, and monitoring of artificial refuges that are required to avoid perverse outcomes and maximise the chances of achieving conservation objectives. This review highlights a clear need for increased rigour in studies of artificial refuges if they are to play an important role in wildlife conservation. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Windbreaks are key structural elements in the rural environment and affect the functionality of landscapes in multiple ways. A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to under informed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of ES scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported. The present review reveals an intense need for further interdisciplinary research using indicators, ES approaches or similar instruments that enable quantitative and comparable statements about the functionality of windbreaks in rural landscapes.  © 2021 The Author(s).

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The opportunities for the global growth of the bioeconomy (BE) are generated by the need to expand the food supply for an increasing world population without compromising the environment even further. Organic agriculture (OA) claims to be more environmentally friendly than conventional agriculture and capable of addressing sustainable development objectives by using green technologies, resulting in economic, social, and ecological benefits. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between OA and BE through a systematic literature review. We addressed the benefits of OA under perspective of the main aspects of BE. As demonstrated by previous papers assessed on this review, OA can be a means to facilitate strategies for the use of renewable resources to mitigate the emergencies arising from global warming, as claimed by the BE concept. This article introduces a necessary discussion due the lack of previous studies reporting the capacity of OA to connect with the BE. As a final contribution, we present a conceptual framework characterizing potential benefits of OA under the perspective of BE, for organic farmers and researchers to advance in sustainability and green innovation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - An estimated 17% of migratory bird species are threatened or near threatened with extinction. This represents an enormous potential loss of biodiversity and cost to human societies due to the economic benefits that birds provide through ecosystem services and ecotourism. Conservation of migratory bird species presents many unique challenges, as these birds rely on multiple geographically distinct habitats, including breeding grounds, non-breeding grounds, and stopover sites during migration. In particular, stopover habitats are seldom studied relative to breeding and non-breeding habitats, despite their importance as refueling stations for migratory birds. In this study, we summarize the current research on the use of temporary primary crops by birds during migration and we assess the species characteristics and agricultural practices most often associated with the use of cropland as stopover habitat. First, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the effects various farming practices and crop types have on the abundance and diversity of migratory birds using agricultural areas for stopovers. Second, we analyzed the ecological correlates of bird species in the Northern Hemisphere that predict which species may use these areas while migrating. We ran a GLMM to test whether primary diet, diet breadth, primary habitat, habitat breadth, or realm predicted stopover use of agricultural areas. Our review suggests that particular crop types (principally rice, corn, and sunflower), as well as farming practices that result in higher non-cultivated plant diversity, encourage the use of agricultural areas by migrating birds. We found that cropland is used as stopover habitat by bird species that can utilize a large breadth of habitats, as well as species with preferences for habitat similar in structure to agricultural areas. © Copyright © 2021 Blount, Horns, Kittelberger, Neate-Clegg and Şekercioğlu.

AB  - There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, powerlines and waterways) generate well documented fragmenting effects on species habitats. However, the potential of verges of linear transportation infrastructures (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of constant loss of natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for compensating the loss of biodiversity they generated have to be considered. This paper is the first synthesis of evidence addressing this topic for vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) in temperate ecosystems. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature survey using two online publication databases, three search engines, specialist websites, and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. We successively screened the articles for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize the retained studies and to critically appraise them. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for vertebrates, and the effects of landscape and management on these potentialities. We critically appraised all studies to assess their risk of bias and created a database of the studies with low and medium risk of bias. We synthesized results for each specific question in narrative syntheses. Finally, studies that met meta-analysis requirements were used for quantitative syntheses. Results: Our initial searches identified 83,565 documents. After critical appraisal, we retained 119 documents that reported 128 studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (49%) and in the United States of America (22%), and were about mammals (61%) and birds (20%). Results from the narrative synthesis and meta-analyses converged and revealed that the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges to constitute a habitat for vertebrate species varies according to the infrastructure and the biological group considered. Especially, highway verges may be a refuge for small mammals but seems detrimental to birds. The potential also varied depending on the landscape considered, with urbanisation being related to lower biodiversity hosted by verges. We found a wide variety of verge management practices with few studies on each practice, which prevented us from drawing general conclusions. Likewise, we found too few studies assessing the corridor potential of verges to be able to fully conclude although this potential seems to exist. We did not find any study assessing the effect of landscape context or management on the role of corridor of verges. Conclusions: We identified a major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for vertebrates, and when they exist studies rarely directly measured movements on verges. We thus encourage more research on this topic and the development of protocols that enable direct measures of vertebrate movements. The effect of management practices on the role of habitat of verges also deserves further investigations, and research efforts should be coordinated to focus on one specific practice (e.g. vegetation management). © 2020 The Author(s).

T2  - Progress in Physical Geography
AB  - Beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams, despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas. In this study, we completed a systematic review of previous research on the structure and ecosystem effects of beaver canals to provide an increasingly holistic understanding of these landscape features. Specifically, we: 1) summarized why, where, when, and how beaver develop canals; 2) chronicled all published descriptions on beaver canal morphology; and 3) summarized the literature on the environmental effects of beaver canals. Thirty-one relevant studies were identified and incorporated into this review. Beaver canals have been identified in numerous environments ranging from largely undeveloped mountainous regions to heavily developed agricultural landscapes. Beaver primarily develop canals to increase accessibility to riparian resources, facilitate transport of harvested resources, and to decrease predation risk. As with beaver dams, beaver canals exhibit large structural variability, particularly in lengths, which can be over 0.5 km. Widths of about 1 m and depths of about 0.5 m are common. Beaver canals alter watershed hydrology by creating new aquatic habitats, connecting isolated aquatic features, and diverting water into colonized areas. Beaver canals have been identified as favored habitats for several biotic species and are sometimes used during critical life stages (e.g. dispersal). In addition to increasing overall floral and faunal species richness and diversity, beaver canals may benefit biota by mitigating habitat fragmentation and climate change impacts. Based on the results of this review, incorporating beaver canals into stream restoration practices may be environmentally beneficial. © The Author(s) 2019.

T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - Large floodplain rivers (LFRs) are currently threatened by high levels of human alteration, and utilization is expected to grow. Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important. Empirical research in this field can aid in solving conflicts between socio-economic demands for ecosystem services and nature conservation of LFRs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Bird guilds show different responses to tree retention levels: a meta-analysis

T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
AB  - Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) as an integrated information- and production-based farming system is designed to delivery high-end technology solutions to increase farm production efficiency and profitability while minimizing environmental impacts on the ecosystems and the environment. PA technologies are technology innovations that incorporate recent advances in modern agriculture providing evidence for lower production costs, increased farming efficiency and reduced impacts. However, the adoption of the precision agriculture technologies has encountered difficulties such as additional application or management costs and investment on new equipment and trained employees. Some of these PA technologies were proven efficient, providing tangible benefits with lower costs and as a result they quickly gained scientific interest. To investigate further the economic, agronomic, and environmental benefits from the adoption of PA technologies a systematic review was conducted, based on the systematic search and evaluation of related eligible articles.

TI  - Contributions of dry rivers to human well-being: A global review for future research

T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Dry rivers (DR) are a non-perennial type of river that flows for only hours or a few days, primarily after heavy rain that often causes flash floods. Unlike intermittent and ephemeral rivers, they are disconnected from groundwater and do not support aquatic life. DR have often been undervalued by some scientific and social groups in terms of nature's contributions to people (NCP) because of the lack of an integrative perspective to encompass them and their high aridity and low flow. This study aims to provide the state of the art on DR in terms of geographic distribution, NCP, human well-being and drivers of change, and to identify knowledge gaps and the tools to bridge them. To this end, a systematic review of 79 scientific documents (26 case studies, 53 evidence-based works) published between 1995 and 2019 was conducted. Firstly, we analysed the main research trends using publication rates and bibliometric techniques. Secondly, we analysed DR distribution, NCP and drivers of change using mapping techniques, descriptive statistics and bibliographic analysis respectively. We especially identified regulating NCP but to a lesser extent, also material and non-material NCP affected by land use change, climate change, overexploitation, and demographic, political and economic changes. We found relevant gaps on NCP and how they affect the different components of well-being, and the effect of indirect drivers of change on them. Geographical information systems, international scientific collaboration, and basin and transdisciplinary approaches, could accelerate bridging gaps while new research, rehabilitation, management and conservation, and socio-economic opportunities are developed in parallel.

TI  - A global systematic review of empirical evidence of ecotourism impacts on forests in biodiversity hotspots
AU  - Brandt, JS
AU  - Buckley, RC
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Ecotourism is growing rapidly in biodiversity hotspots because of its promise to achieve both economic growth and environmental conservation. We reviewed the literature for empirical evidence that ecotourism protects forests. Our conclusions are at once both sobering and encouraging. Ecotourism, as it is typically practiced, leads to deforestation. However, when accompanied by conservation mechanisms (e.g. protected area, Payment for Ecosystem Services, monitoring/enforcement), ecotourism can protect forests. Ecotourism sometimes leads to forest regeneration in agrarian landscapes, but trade-offs, for example old-growth deforestation or water pollution, may occur. From a methodological perspective, we found a dearth (only 17) of articles that empirically analyzed ecotourism impacts on forests, and no studies that used counterfactual impact evaluation approaches. We conclude that there is an insufficient evidence base for inferring effects of ecotourism on forests, and we identify research priorities to build knowledge about how, when, and where to implement ecotourism.

TI  - Acceptance studies in the field of land use-A critical and systematic review to advance the conceptualization of acceptance and acceptability
AU  - Busse, M
AU  - Siebert, R
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Despite the increasing importance of studies dealing with acceptance in the field of land use, few theoretical conceptual reflections and reviews have been published. To address this gap, this paper offers a critical and systematic review of recent literature regarding acceptance and land use. Our aim is to synthesise the contributions of these publications in order to advance scientific debate on this topic. The data set consists of 132 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and is dominated by empirical papers (mostly quantitative studies) and European case studies. Renewable energy appears as the most important thematic issue, followed by sustainable land use. In these studies, many researchers did not define acceptance or apply a theory. It seems to be perceived as an everyday term with a clear meaning. However, this review reveals that there is no common understanding of acceptance; instead, the given definitions and characteristics are sometimes even contradictory. Acceptance is often considered a positive and desirable outcome of planning projects. Only a few authors understand acceptance as a complex phenomenon. As a cross-sectoral research topic, it applies theories from different disciplines and research fields (psychology, sociology, and innovation research), even though the use of these theories within disciplines is not consistent. Most empirical studies address influencing factors with the aim of explaining decisions about acceptance. However, the theoretical foundation underlying the selection of factors is often weak. Therefore, we recommend that researchers engage in a thorough reflection of notions and concepts, suitable and sound identification of influencing factors. In concluding with our own theoretical-conceptual reflections, we support the idea that acceptance and acceptability should be distinguished to gain more clarity in the use of terms. Thus, acceptability encompasses actor-based and dynamic decision processes. The decisions are products of interactions among the actors, the object, and the context. They can be assigned to a particular degree (from rejection to acceptance or engagement) and made at the attitude, action, or utilization level. Finally, we believe that further research can benefit from this advanced concept of acceptability.

AB  - The socio-ecological systems (SESs) framework provides cross-disciplinary insight into complex environmental problems. Numerous studies have applied the SES framework to coastal and marine environments over the last two decades. We review and analyze 98 of those studies to (i) describe how SES concepts were examined and measured, (ii) describe how the studies included feedbacks and thresholds, and (iii) identify and analyze elements unique to coastal and marine SES frameworks. We find that progress has been made in understanding key SES properties in coastal and marine ecosystems, which include resilience, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and governance. A variety of methods has been developed and applied to analyze these features qualitatively and quantitatively. We also find that recent studies have incorporated land-based stressors in their analyses of coastal issues related to nutrient runoff, bacterial pollution, and management of anadromous species to represent explicit links in land-to-sea continuums. However, the literature has yet to identify methods and data that can be used to provide causal evidence of non-linearities and thresholds within SES. In addition, our findings suggest that greater alignment and consistency are needed in models with regard to metrics and spatial boundaries between ecological and social systems to take full advantage of the SES framework and improve coastal and marine management.

AB  - Urbanization affects the occurrence, abundance and distribution of pollinators worldwide. Although urban green spaces support many pollinators, global estimates of urban pollinator diversity are still lacking. Here, we present a global overview of urban pollinators, characterizing the most frequently recorded species and functional groups, as well as the types of urban green spaces where these pollinators were most frequently recorded. A systematic review of the literature revealed a total of 11,560 pollinator records in urban green areas. These comprised 3148 species from 255 cities in 46 countries, with more than half of the studies (similar to 67 %) carried out in non-tropical cities. Hymenoptera was the main pollinator group recorded, especially bees, followed by Lepidoptera and Diptera worldwide. However, birds were more commonly reported in tropical than non-tropical regions, highlighting their importance as pollinators in the tropics. The most frequently recorded species were social and generalist bees, including invasive and managed species. Hence, while some bees may be able to persist in urban areas, other groups may face challenges that need to be considered when planning urban pollinator conservation. Considering the urban habitat types where pollinators were sampled, university campuses and gardens were the most common types investigated in tropical and non-tropical regions, respectively. These results may reflect regional differences in urban landscape characteristics, as well as a research bias caused by greater investment in urban ecology research in non-tropical countries. Our review synthetizes the diversity of urban pollinators worldwide and highlights the gaps and challenges in promoting their conservation more inclusively.

TI  - A classification to align social-ecological land systems research with policy in Europe
AU  - Winkler, KJ

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Both research and policy recognize land systems as fundamental to human life and activities. However, these two perspectives approach land from different ends and it can be difficult to see how studied variables contribute to broader policy goals. In this paper, we argue that there is a need to better select variables to study land systems as social-ecological systems, and to align research more with those policy goals. Concentrating on the European continent, we pursue three interrelated objectives: we (1) build a classification of land systems variables, (2) examine where existing land systems research is positioned in this classification, and (3) compare a set of policies and science-policy frameworks with the classified research. To do so, we conduct a systematic review of 69 peer-reviewed, empirical land systems papers, as well as four overarching policies and science-policy frameworks. We find that over 60% of the reviewed papers include both environmental and social variables, and we identify 154 unique variables studied, 57% of which are environmental. The average paper examines four times as many environmental variables as social ones. We find that policies and science-policy frameworks stress social variables more and include health and air quality aspects that are lacking in the reviewed land systems research. Our classification can help to design research that includes both social and environmental variables and is aligned with broader policy goals. We highlight social variables with available spatial data to encourage a more balanced and integrative social-ecological research design, going beyond a focus on the built and natural environment. Our classification can contribute to guiding land systems researchers towards greater policy relevance. We hope that our classification contributes to a conversation within land systems research on the selection of variables, as well as its further development.

AB  - Many biodiversity conservation strategies aim to increase species movement by changing the landscape between suitable areas of habitat. We applied systematic review and meta-analytical methods to robustly assess evidence on the impact of matrix structure on movement rates, with the hypothesis that movement will be greater through matrix of a more similar structure (vegetation height and cover) to the home habitat. Twenty studies of movement through two or more different matrix types provided 107 effect sizes, expressing the difference between the relative movement rates in different matrix types. The studies were all on animals, including relatively mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies but also rodents and amphibians. We were able to detect that on average, movement was greater through matrix of a more similar structure to the species' habitat despite the variation in studies in terms of matrix types, species and methods. The effect size was larger when there was a greater difference in the structure of the two matrix types being compared (e.g. comparing grassland to forest rather than short grass to long grass). However, there was a high degree of covariation between matrix contrast and studies and other significant subgroupings such as taxonomic group and matrix openness. The biological significance of the increase in movement is not clear; however, ecological theory predicts dispersing individuals are important for population dynamics. Changes to the structure of landscapes intended to improve permeability to movement are supported by the findings of this study, particularly for relatively mobile species. However, research over longer timescales, greater distances and range of taxonomic groups is necessary.

T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined.        Aims. Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective.        Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools.        Key results. Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7).        Conclusions. Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline.        Implications. Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.

AB  - Industrial forestry typically leads to a simplified forest structure and altered species composition. Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25years ago to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and temperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no comprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well as un-harvested forests.        Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78 studies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-harvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least in the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna.        Retention cuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as higher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species taken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist species and unclassified species), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts.        Retention cuts had negative impacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior species may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some open-habitat species compared with clearcuts.        Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of forest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were not enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on biodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on either forest species or open-habitat species, although limited data may have hindered our capacity to identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic groups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively.        Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for integrating biodiversity conservation and production forestry, although identifying optimal solutions between these two goals may need further attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will not substitute for conservation actions targeting certain highly specialized species associated with forest-interior or open-habitat conditions.

TI  - Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management
AU  - Sievers, M

T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones.        2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones.        3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition.        4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial.        5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.

AB  - Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes.        Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis.        Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had "control-impact" design, only two studies used "before-after-controlimpact" design, and one study used "before-after" design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads.        Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.

AB  - In the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has been traditionally targeted at reducing flood risk. However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climatesensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is an iconic large carnivore that has increasingly been recognized as an apex predator with intrinsic value and a keystone species. However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human-carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the 'pre-genomic era' and the first insights of the 'genomics era'. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650-850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.

AU  - Petrin, Z
AU  - Brittain, JE
AU  - Saltveit, SJ
T2  - FRESHWATER SCIENCE
AB  - Species traits have been identified as a component of biodiversity that is worthy of investigation as a tool for exploring ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances. We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation. We advocate inclusion of species-trait variables that may affect ecosystem-level ecological processes in environmental assessment studies because a better understanding of trait-mediated ecological functioning should facilitate assessment of the ecological consequences of anthropogenic perturbations of freshwater ecosystems.

AU  - Farrell, C.
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Naturalistic plantings, such as meadow-style plantings, can improve the quality of urban green spaces through aesthetic, biodiversity and low maintenance features. Species selection for, and maintenance of naturalistic plantings are key to their success. While herbaceous and grassy meadows can be mowed, naturalistic plantings with woody plants require more intense maintenance to remove biomass and promote resprouting. We aim to understand woody plant responses to diverse disturbance regimes to potentially inform the selection and management of woody species in urban plantings. We conducted a quantitative systematic literature review of 72 papers and investigated what main external (climate, disturbance regime) and internal (buds, life stage, storage reserves) factors influence the resprouting response of woody plants. We found resprouting literature is geographically widespread for woody plants, but studies are skewed towards Temperate climates in USA and Australia, with a focus on high severity and high frequency fire disturbance. Resprouting response was mostly defined as a continuous response to disturbance dependent on disturbance regime, climate and plant traits. Maintenance and management of naturalistic woody plantings, through hard pruning techniques such as coppicing, may be informed by analogous high severity and high frequency disturbance studies. However, the literature on woody plant resprouting has several knowledge gaps for lower severity and lower frequency disturbance regimes and in more arid climates. Future research should evaluate the response of naturalistic woody plantings to disturbance in specific urban contexts. © 2024 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T2  - Plant Biology
AB  - Crop–pollinator interactions are essential for world food security. Studying crop pollination from a network approach allows identification of target pollinators for conservation and management, and gaps in our knowledge. Solanaceae represents the third highest ranked family based on economic value, and its production is highly improved by animal pollination. This study aimed to integrate global data on solanaceous crop pollination and analyse the interaction patterns using a meta-network approach. Our questions were: (i) how are interactions structured and what are the structuring roles of species; and (ii) what are the main gaps in our knowledge? Data were obtained through a systematic review of the main scientific databases. The network structure was described using connectivity and modularity calculations, and the role of species using centrality metrics. The 251 pollinator species reported were in seven orders, mainly Hymenoptera (84.9%). The generalists Bombus and Apis species were the most common pollinators. The meta-network was modular, and all modules mostly included bees. Most species were peripherals, around 12% were connectors, and there were no module hubs. Apis mellifera was the only network hub (supergeneralist). The most important pollinators are the most managed pollinators worldwide; however, many native species play a role in structuring the meta-network. Main gaps include species of importance to pepper pollination, lack of species-specific identification, and the need for more robust experimental studies evaluating the pollination efficiency of native, manageable bees. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Key message: Above 40° N/S, increasing latitude is linked to greater post-fire tree regeneration. However, species dominance shifts from conifers to short-lived deciduous trees, which may negatively impact flora, fauna, and ecosystem services dependent on coniferous forests. These results were primarily driven by studies from North America, highlighting the need for more research that directly measures post-fire forest recovery in other high-latitude regions. Context: As the size and frequency of wildfires increase across many regions, high-latitude forests may be at particular risk for decreases in regeneration and state shifts post-fire. Aims: Through this systematic review, we sought to determine the general relationship between post-fire tree regeneration densities and latitude in forests above 40° N/S. We expected regeneration densities post-fire would decrease with increasing latitude, and that forest regeneration would be negatively impacted by high burn severities, forest management, harsh site conditions, and unprotected microsites. We also anticipated that light-demanding species with adaptations to fire would replace shade-tolerant species that lack such adaptations post-fire. Methods: We conducted a literature search that returned over 4500 articles. We selected those that directly measured post-fire regeneration at or above 40° N/S and retained 93 articles for analysis. Fire characteristics, pre- and post-fire tree species compositions and regeneration densities, and regeneration predictors were then extracted from the retained articles. We fit linear mixed models to post-fire regeneration density with latitude and species traits as explanatory variables and also explored the significance and magnitude of predictors that informed post-fire tree species response. Results: Contrary to our expectations, post-fire regeneration increased significantly with latitude. High burn severities and unprotected microsites had negative impacts on post-fire regeneration; higher elevations and more prolific pre- or post-fire reproduction were positively correlated with post-fire regeneration, while management of any type did not have an impact. Conclusion: Although forests are regenerating after wildfires at the most extreme latitudes included in this study (above 55° N), regeneration is often limited to only a handful of genera: aspen (Populus) and birch (Betula), for example. Regeneration was less abundant at the lower range of our study area. Certain lower latitude forests that occupy marginal habitats are under increasing stress from drier, warmer conditions that are exacerbated by wildfires. Results were largely driven by studies from Canada and the USA and may not be applicable to all high-latitude forests. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) is generally defined as a network of natural and semi-natural regions that has been sensitively developed and managed to provide an array of ecosystem services and improve people’s well-being. Across Europe, the notion of GI has had a robust association with the the impacts of climate change, multifunctionality, and green growth; this is especially true over the past ten years, from 2012 to 2022. This has resulted in a broad-based agenda on policy and research with vast differences, targeting a variety of themes and cultures. The systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in this paper present an up-to-date review of the main attributes of GI-related research and the implications for the member states within the European Union (EU). GI-related concepts, thematic clusters, and the main priorities within the research were considered in our review. Due to the ambiguity of the definition of GI, a broad diversity of research goals and published output are discussed. It was also seen that green spaces situated within urban areas and their related ecosystem services are the most common topics in the literature. Based on this, we recommend that an in-depth integration of the goals pertaining to nature conservation be conducted to understand how GI may pertain towards sustainable transitions in and outside the city. © 2020 ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.

AB  - Invasive plants can significantly impact the diversity of understory ground flora and forest regeneration in eastern North America. However, managing invasive plants has resulted in positive, negative, or neutral effects on key ecosystem components depending on treatment type, duration, and intensity. Management may also result in short-term control, but legacy effects from prior land use or secondary invasions may hamper desired long-term outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the invasive plant management literature for eastern North American forests to examine treatment outcomes for invasive and native plants, tree regeneration, and secondary invasions. Our review included 165 articles with few papers published in the 1980s but the number of papers increasing through time thereafter. A variety of control methods were used, including herbicide applications, prescribed burning, torching, girdling, clipping, mastication, soil amendments, flooding, enrichment plantings, and biocontrol, as well as combinations of these treatments. Species included some of the most common forest invaders, such as the privets (Ligustrum spp.), honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), buckthorns (Rhamnus cathartica and Frangula alnus), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum), cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), and Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera). The literature also included recent invaders in eastern North America, such as Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) and fig buttercup (Ficaria verna). Findings suggest that invasive plant control efficacy is highly variable and context dependent. Information on long-term effects is limited because most studies reported on findings occurring within a few years of treatment. However, long-term success may be limited without additional management (e.g., enrichment plantings, artificial tree regeneration, re-establishing historic fire regimes, reducing herbivore densities) that ameliorates impacts from past land-use, disturbance history, or other factors. We suggest that future studies and the development of control tactics consider comprehensive approaches to building resilience in forest communities where invasive plants are only one aspect of the forest management continuum. © 2023

T2  - Environmental Impact Assessment Review
AB  - Current agricultural practices are increasingly considered to be unsustainable, causing serious threats to the environment. To meet international and European sustainability goals, the transition to sustainable agriculture is pivotal and ways to achieve it are currently under discussion. Conventional agricultural systems are typically highly productive, ensuring high yields for feeding a growing global population, but with significant environmental costs. Contrarily, organic agriculture is perceived as a sustainable farming option, however, is often criticized for achieving lower yields, so that when this factor is taken into account, its advantages are often questioned. To compare the environmental performance of different cropping system, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly applied over time. The present work aims at systematically reviewing LCA studies that consistently assess and compare the environmental impacts of organic and conventional crop systems, enabling the understanding of the environmental performance of organic and conventional management systems, including a broad spectrum of impacts (15 environmental indicators in total). The systematic review, complemented with a meta-analysis, resulted in the selection and analysis of 77 pairwise comparative LCA studies. These perform a comparison between the two cultivation management systems (i.e. organic and conventional) of a specific crop or group of crops, cultivated under similar pedoclimatic conditions in both systems, and show consistency in the main LCA methodological choices. Independently from the functional unit adopted (mass or land-based) and despite the lower yields, organic systems show overall a better environmental performance than conventional ones. These results are valid for the majority of the impacts assessed (climate change, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, use of resources, water, and energy). Certain crop classes systematically show lower impacts when organically cultivated, although exception exists within the same class (e.g. overall trend valid for fruit but not for apples). Fertilisation resulted to be the cultivation process responsible for most of the impacts in conventional systems, playing a key role also in organic systems together with activities linked to machinery and field operations. The heterogeneity of modelling approaches encountered makes the comparison of cropping systems difficult and the definition of trends challenging. Modelling differences were found regarding the choice of functional unit and inventory models to estimate emissions, the inclusion or exclusion of certain processes or flows in the inventory, and the selection and modelling of impact categories. In addition, key aspects such as soil quality, biodiversity and water use are still poorly investigated. © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Land
AB  - Wild food gathering activities (i.e., foraging practices) played an important role in securing food in the past. Nowadays, these resources and the knowledge around their use are experiencing a process of erosion. This article aims to identify the factors explaining the abandonment or, on the other hand, the preservation of foraging practices in Europe. The second aim is to analyze how these practices contribute to the economic and social development of local communities and to the sustainability of land management. A systematic review of the literature on European foraging practices was performed to answer these research questions. Following this approach, 111 publications were selected and analyzed. The results highlight that the reasons for the abandonment of foraging practices are related to socio-economic changes as well as changes in the environment such as reduced availability and land-use change. On the other hand, heritagization processes of these resources, such as wild plants sold as traditional local products, in restaurants, or as eco-tourism experiences, are emerging. The sustainability of these practices has not been widely evaluated in the literature. Efficient management strategies of wild food resources could help foster all three dimensions of sustainability at the local level, as well as help preserve traditional knowledge. This systematic review thus contributes to highlighting the framework in which the sustainability of these practices should be assessed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon emissions from land use change are the leading causes of the greenhouse effect. Exploration of the progress and hotspots of research on land-use carbon emissions (LUCE) is crucial for mitigating global climate warming. However, a comprehensive and systematic review of LUCE research from a global perspective is still lacking. We used the WoS Core Collection Database to analyze the current status of research on LUCE from a global perspective with the aid of a bibliometrix tool, aiming to reveal research hotspots and future development trends. We found that (1) the process of LUCE research has gone through a nascent exploration stage (1992–2001), a problem-focused stage (2002–2011), and a prosperous development stage (2012–2022) under different policy orientations. European and North American countries prioritize LUCE research more than others. (2) Overseas research hotspots mainly focus on the climate effects of land-use change, the impact of deforestation and fire on carbon stocks, the impact of soil organic carbon stocks on climate change and biodiversity, and agricultural carbon emissions. Research hotspots in China mainly focus on the study of the influencing factors of land-use carbon emissions, the path to achieving the dual carbon goal, and the transition to a low carbon economy. (3) Research frontiers show that China mainly researches low-carbon land use intensification in the context of a “dual carbon” strategy; carbon emission reduction based on energy transition; and the multi-dimensional, dynamic, and accurate tracking and monitoring of land-use carbon emission systems using remote sensing satellite data. Other countries have shifted from measuring historical land-use carbon emissions, deforestation, degradation and fire carbon emissions to biomass combustion and global warming mitigation research. This study enhances the depth and breadth of LUCE research, which can provide a theoretical foundation and scientific reference for subsequent research on LUCE. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Biological indicators of soil quality express the capacity of a soil to maintain its ecosystem functions and services between socio-ecosystem inflection thresholds; therefore, they are determinants in management and land use decisions. However, their development until a few decades ago was limited for several reasons: reductionism and early development of other dimensions, such as physical and chemical indicators or their methodological complexity, thus affecting the importance given to biological factors and the integral evaluation of soil quality or health. Thus, this review presents a mapping of the scientific contributions of the last 50 years oriented to the theoretical and methodological development of biological indicators of soil quality, identifying their development and application in these decades. We conducted a bibliometric analysis that allowed us to present an overview of the field with respect to scientific production: temporality, geographical origin, institutional origin, journals that promote the development of the field, articles with greater influence by citation in the field of study, and the co-occurrences of these indicators in research. This analysis was complemented at the second stage by a systematic review of the literature with the greatest impact by citation. We found 2320 scientific papers distributed mainly in the United States (17.8%), China (12.2%), Brazil (8.3%), India (6.3%), and European Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, France, and Italy (14.2%). Our review showed 25 biological indicators with the highest occurrence; for example, microbial biomass (1 1 8), enzymatic activity (90), and organic matter (78); other indicators, such as earthworms, nematodes, or springtails, are also reported. All indicators showed relationships, to a greater or lesser extent, with soil biodiversity and its functions in the landscape. Important advances in soil indicators have developed gradually in the last few decades, with scientific efforts mainly concentrated in developed and emerging countries. In the last decade, the production curve continues with a growth trend., and research questions in the field revolve around the linkage of diversity and function from a molecular point of view. The scope goes beyond productivity, manifesting the real need to conserve and manage the ecosystem services of a limited and non-renewable natural resource. Pioneering research should begin to report on the scope of soil biological monitoring and its influence on policy, management, and land use. Finally, the promotion of research networks with developing countries can foster the development of regional and local soil monitoring policies in these regions. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The current, rapid urbanisation process impacts global biodiversity and can be a driver for phenotypic changes in mammals that persist in cities. Animals display different response strategies in urban environments compared to natural areas, but patterns may differ among species. To better comprehend this process, we focused on a limited number of species that are present in many urban green spaces around the globe. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate which response strategies chipmunks, arboreal and flying squirrels use to cope with urban environments, exploring whether there are general response patterns, and to reveal potential adaptations to life in urban areas. We included studies that compared trait differences among conspecifics living in different areas along an urbanisation gradient (rural–urban) and studies comparing individuals or populations between urban areas with different environmental characteristics. The effects of urbanisation on chipmunks, arboreal and flying squirrels, at the individual and at the population levels, were identified in nine topics. Included articles explored at least one of these topics and their key findings were described. Effects of urbanisation are evident in all considered topics. However, we found contrasting patterns between species or even among individuals of the same species studied in different geographical areas. Overall, we reported two knowledge gaps: some phenotypic traits were considered in few studies, and many species, especially those living in the Global South, where urban growth rate is higher, have not been studied. This systematic review suggests that urbanisation can be an important driver for adaptation in small mammals, underlining the complexity and differentiation of response patterns. Since target species have important ecological and social roles, additional comparative studies, increasing our understanding of processes that determine their presence in cities, are essential for urban green planning which aims to conserve biodiversity. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Functional diversity is an emergent approach in ecology that has been applied globally to better understand the relationships between organisms and the environment. However, assessing the functional diversity of freshwater fish is a challenge for scientists. Aiming to summarize the evolution of scientific knowledge on fish functional diversity, we performed a systematic review of the literature published from 1945 to 2021 using the Web of Science. Based on the 101 articles reviewed, we found that publications about functional diversity of fishes have increased over time, mainly in Neotropical, Indomalayan and Palearctic regions. Most studies were conducted in lotic ecosystems, especially to assess environmental impacts such as biological invasions and land use. Functional diversity has been assessed mainly by morphological traits that reflect feeding and locomotion dimensions. Functional richness was the most common index used in the studies. Our findings suggest that political neglect and lack of investments may hamper the research development in several places. The missing information about the functional traits of many species may limit the use of the functional approach. We also highlight the need for the incorporation of functional diversity in conservation programs once functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity to maintain freshwater ecosystem functioning. © 2023 The Authors.

T2  - Frontiers in Forests and Global Change
AB  - Forests in mountain areas provide an indispensable ecosystem service by protecting people and infrastructure against natural hazards. As forests are increasingly affected by global change, including climate change, more frequent and severe natural disturbances, and shifts in land use, open questions remain regarding the long-term and sustainable provision of this crucial protective service. To improve our understanding of the various effects of global change on protective forests, we summarized the current knowledge based on a systematic review. Focusing on changes in mountain forests’ protective effect against snow avalanches, landslides, rockfall, torrential floods and debris flow, we assessed 72 peer-reviewed, English publications. Overall, climate-induced changes are expected to increase forests’ protective effect at higher elevations but reduce it at lower elevations mainly due to increased drought. Natural disturbances usually decrease the protective effect of forests, and their impact is often further exacerbated by salvage logging. Different forest management strategies are often studied using forest simulation models, and their impacts on protective forests strongly depend on the local context and interactions with climate change. While clearcuts consistently reduce the protective effect, other forest management interventions such as thinning can have either positive or negative effects. Most of the reviewed studies were case studies based on forest simulation or process-based hazard models (but rarely combining the two), while empirical evidence was scarce. Forests’ protective effect is often assessed using (diverse) indicators of forest structure, but evaluations of resulting risks are less common. More consistent modeling approaches linking forest structure to hazard and risk, as well as consistent indicators across different case studies, are needed for a better understanding of changes in protective forests and the service they provide under global change.

AB  - Nest site selection is an important behavior, particularly in species that lack parental care, as nest microclimate can greatly impact embryos' survival and offspring phenotype. Understanding which factors influence oviposition decisions is critical to identifying priority areas for conservation. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the factors that affect nest site selection by freshwater turtles. The search was conducted in the Web of Science database. In total, 35 publications met the eligibility criteria. The first study on the topic was published more than three decades ago, but only within the last ten years have studies started to be published annually. More than half of the studies were conducted in the United States and the most studied species was Chrysemys picta. Environmental factors, mainly vegetation characteristics, but also soil properties and beach morphology, are the most studied. Anthropogenic factors have been increasingly studied, especially residential areas and agricultural fields. Some studies suggest that human-altered habitats may act as ecological traps, emphasizing the need for further research on this topic. More studies are also needed on the influence of predation risk, co-species cues, female size, and offspring phenotype on nest site selection by freshwater turtles. We highlight that understanding the factors affecting nest site selection is important for identifying the habitat needs of nesting females, predicting possible ecological implications of nest site choice, assessing the adaptive potential of species to environmental change, and determining the vulnerability of populations to different threats. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are intensely endangered, entailing declines in the biodiversity and ecosystem services. Fire may affect the physicochemical water quality parameters of these environments by transference of ash and toxic substances into water bodies, altering nutrient and oxygen concentrations, temperature or turbidity. However, major knowledge gaps in the impacts of fire on freshwater habitats are prevalent. We conducted a systematic review by searching articles in the Web of Science related to the impacts of fire on the physicochemical water properties of freshwater ecosystems. We quantified the set of physicochemical parameters investigated and provided an overview of fire-mediated alterations. We found 54 articles published between 1976 and 2019, with a significant increase during the last decade. Research was strongly biased towards a few temperate western countries, mostly across North America, Europe and Australia. Lotic systems were considerably more studied than lentic systems. Overall, 57 chemical and 17 physical parameters were evaluated, comprising 304 and 77 cases, respectively. Fire altered 68 % of the cases studied and contingency tables showed that this alteration was proportionally similar between chemical (66 %) and physical (75 %) properties. Nutrient concentration, metal ions, alkalinity, turbidity and temperature were parameters recurrently increased by fire (56 %), whereas oxygen mostly decreased (70 %). Our study demonstrates that fire commonly affects water quality parameters of freshwater ecosystems. Biases and resulting gaps may steer future sampling efforts and promote a broader understanding of the impacts of fire on these environments. Our results may ultimately guide applicable conservation policies for biodiversity and water management strategies of freshwater ecosystems. © 2023 E.

AB  - Research background: The services provided by ecosystems are the main support for human populations and for the development of any type of activity. Today, the provision of these services is under threat. The economic valuation of ecosystem services is vital to design appropriate policies, define strategies and manage ecosystems. Purpose of the article: The objective of this study is to analyse the evolution of research on the economic valuation of ecosystem services over the last two decades. More specifically, it aims firstly to identify the main agents driving research and, secondly, it seeks to synthesize in a single document the relevant information on the main economic valuation methods, relating them to the categories of services, ecosystems and regions where they have been employed. Methods: A quantitative review was first carried out through a bibliometric analysis to identify the main drivers of this line of research and its development trends. Secondly, a qualitative review was conducted through a systematic review focusing on the most commonly used valuation techniques in relation to the characteristics of the service, the geographical scope and the ecosystem analysed. Findings & value added: The main novelty of this work, compared to previous literature, is that the relationship between the study area, the type of ecosystem, the category of service and the economic valuation methodology are analysed for the first time. The results highlight the need to continue expanding knowledge in relation to the temporal and spatial scale in the economic value of ecosystem services, the subjective nature of the estimates and the heterogeneity between the different social sectors with respect to the benefit obtained.

AB  - Humans worldwide depend on ecosystems and the services they provide. Land use and land cover change increasingly, influencing ecosystem values to the extent that the rate and direction of change occurred. The objective of this study was to review the link between changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and Ecosystem Service Value (ESV), with emphasis on mountainous landscapes in Ethiopia. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. Area-specific and country-level studies showed that the ESV changed as the result of the LULC changes in the country. The change in land use in Ethiopia resulted not only in the loss of ESVs but also in the gain of ESVs depending on the type of man’s activity. Negative change in LULC—especially the deterioration of land cover types such as forest land, shrub land and grass land—resulted in the loss of ESVs, whereas positive LULC change increased the value of ESVs. In Ethiopia, there is a loss of about USD 85 billion per year from the loss of ecosystem services. To save, improve and promote ESVs, land restoration and rehabilitation activities are important. The review provides insights into the need for and focus of future studies on LULC changes and the valuing of ESVs to understand the impact of changes in LULC on ESVs, considering existing and forecasted population increase in rapidly urbanizing areas. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem services trade-offs and synergies is critical for forest management. Plant functional traits provide an approach to identify the relationships between forest structure, processes, and ecosystem services, and to explain the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services. We performed a systematic literature review of forest ecosystem services trade-offs and synergies from the perspective of plant functional traits based on 216 articles. The number of associations varied greatly in terms of both traits and ecosystem services. 51.9% were associated with leaf traits, while the most associated services were soil fertility (16.7%), biomass (15.7%), and carbon sequestration services (14.7%). Plant functional traits (15.4%) associated with individual services tended to have stable positive or negative relationships with those services, but most plant functional traits (84.6%) were associated with multiple ecosystem services. Trade-offs existed primarily between regulating services (runoff control, pest control, carbon regulation, invasion control, air quality regulation, and soil conservation) and material production services (biomass, soil water content, sediment buffering of mass movement, and wind protection), and synergies mainly existed within regulating and material production services. The 41 plant functional traits that had a substantial influence on ecosystem services trade-offs or synergies corresponded to five different ecosystem structures or processes (belowground structure, aboveground structure, material decomposition, material production, and nutrient capture). These empirical findings contribute to our understanding of trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services, and have the potential to provide effective strategies for forest restoration and management. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Human-induced land degradation and impairment of ecosystem services (ES) are among the serious problems in Ethiopia due to excessive pressure on land and water resources. Thus, various land management (LM) practices have been done to enhance ES and environmental sustainability. However, very little is known about the influence of efficacious LM practices on multiple ES. This study aims at assessing the implication of LM practices on crop yield, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, soil moisture, runoff, soil loss, nutrient loss, and cultural/societal services. A systematic review and synthesis methods were employed. Predefined criteria were used to screen relevant articles; thereby, 572 observations from 94 studies were extracted and synthesized. The results showed that agronomic practices increased grain yields, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, and soil moisture on average by 28, 29, 43 and 14%, respectively. Biological practices regulated runoff, soil loss, and nutrient loss on average by 46, 59 and 94%, respectively. Overall, LM practices were efficacious to enhance delivery of ES bundles but soil bund and fanyaa juu reduced the grain yield on average by 24 and 22%, respectively. This indicates that there are trade-offs between provisioning and other services like regulating, supporting and cultural under physical structures. However, landscape-level collective impact of different LM practices exhibited without any ES trade-offs. The integration of properly designed physical structures with agronomic and biological practices is imperative to enhance ES and balance the trade-offs in the agricultural landscapes. Further, it is important to find out alternative combinations of agricultural LM practices and evaluate for ES delivery. © 2021 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

AB  - Regenerative Agriculture (RA) claims to build soil organic carbon (SOC) and increase crop yields through simultaneous adoption of a suite of management practices which restore soil health. However, this claim is largely unevidenced as few studies of fully integrated regenerative systems are currently available. As a first step to addressing this knowledge gap, we here examine three practices now being promoted as part of RA: reducing tillage intensity, cover cropping and including a grass-based phase in arable rotations (ley-arable rotations). Our Bayesian meta-analysis of 195 paired SOC and crop yield observations from a systematic review of published studies finds statistically significant increases in SOC concentration for reduced tillage intensity (0.06 g C · 100 g−1) and ley-arable rotations (0.05 g C · 100−1 g yr−1 of ley) compared to conventional practice over an average study duration of 15 years, but no effect of cover crops. None of these practices reduce yield during cropping years, although we find no evidence of a win-win between increasing SOC and enhanced agricultural productivity following adoption. Future work should also evaluate the net greenhouse gas emission implications of each practice and potential for synergistic effects if RA practices are adopted in combination. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the RA practices investigated here can be promoted by land managers and policy makers without crop yield losses. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Do higher urban densities contribute to more sustainable cities and communities? This paper examines the effectiveness of higher density (as a means) for achieving sustainable urban development (the goal) following three lines of enquiry. First, a systematic review of the scientific literature (n = 229 peer-reviewed empirical studies) is presented on the effects of urban density. Second, the motivations for increasing urban density are studied in a systematic review of Swedish planning practices based on the comprehensive urban plans in 59 municipalities. Third, these two studies are compared to find matches and mismatches between evidence and practice. Although positive effects exist for public infrastructure, transport and economics, there are also considerable negative environmental, social and health impacts. This creates a challenging task for urban planners to assess the trade-offs involving densification and accommodate current urbanisation rates. Some topics are found to be over-represented in research (transport effects), seldom discussed in practice (environmental impact), and misaligned when comparing motives and evidence (social impact). Furthermore, for some topics, urban density thresholds are found that are important because they may explain some of the divergences in the results between studies. PRACTICE RELEVANCE The transfer of knowledge from research to planning practice is a serious concern as planning strategies are not aligned with scientific evidence. Planning practice in Sweden is more positive about the contribution of higher density to sustainable urban development than the results of empirical studies warrant. The largest deviation is found in relation to the social impacts of higher density where the planning arguments are not aligned with the evidence. Several reported negative effects of densification (e.g. water management, recreational infrastructure, biodiversity) are not sufficiently accounted for in Sweden’s planning policy and strategy. The narrow planning focus on decarbonising cities and densification needs to be broadened to ensure cities are resilient against the effects of climate change and include mitigation strategies to reduce negative social, environmental and health impacts. The findings can be used to develop evidence-based planning strategies. Other countries can apply this process to assess their planning strategies. © 2021 The Author(s).

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - International trade in soybean has been increasing exponentially over the last 30 years, stimulating agricultural expansion and intensification, primarily in South America. Trade in soybean has been promoted by national and international agencies to stimulate economic development in low- and middle-income countries. Trade in soybean has generated an increase in GDP and average income in producing countries, but soybean production is also linked to negative effects on the well-being of local populations, such as land appropriation and increased social conflicts among communities. In addition, soybean production is linked to extensive deforestation and clearance of natural vegetation as well as water pollution due to intensive agricultural practices, which in turn has negative impacts on human well-being. As such, more information is needed to understand the range of negative and positive impacts of soybean production on people and the environment. This study presents a systematic literature review of the direct and indirect social-economic impacts of soybean agricultural production for trade. We employ the concept of multi-dimensional well-being to classify the various direct social impacts that have been found in the literature and the concept of ecosystem services to classify indirect social impacts, as the contribution of natural ecosystems to human well-being. The main finding of the review is that the empirical evidence for direct social impacts of soy production is scarce and mixed in terms of direction of impact. More tangible dimensions such as income, nutrition and living standards are more often positively impacted by soy trade, while more intangible dimensions such as freedom of choice and cultural value are found to be negatively affected. The empirical evidence for impacts on ecosystem services is more comprehensive and shows a clear picture of negative impacts associated with soybean production due to land use changes and deforestation, and agricultural intensification. There is hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of sustainable value chain policies. © 2021

AB  - Because of the significant impacts on both human interests and bird conservation, it is imperative to identify patterns and anticipate drivers of human–bird conflicts (HBCs) worldwide. Through a global systematic review, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we analyzed the socioeconomic factors and bird ecological traits driving the degree of knowledge and extent of HBCs. We included 166 articles published from 1971 to 2020 in our analyses through which we built a profile of the socioeconomic conditions of 52 countries with reported conflicts and the ecological traits of the 161 bird species involved in HBCs. Although HBC expanded worldwide, it had the greatest impact in less-developed countries (estimate 0. 66 [SE 0.13], p< 0.05), where agriculture is critical for rural livelihoods. Species with a relatively greater conflict extent had a relatively broader diet (estimate 0.80 [SE 0.22], p<0.05) and an increasing population trend (estimate 0.58 [SE 0.15], p<0.05) and affected human interests, such as agriculture and livestock raising. In countries with greater biodiversity, HBCs caused greater socioeconomic impacts than in more developed countries. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and addressing HBCs from multiple perspectives (ecological, sociocultural, and political) to effectively protect both biodiversity and local livelihoods. © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - As the global population increases, the expansion of road networks has led to the destruction and disturbance of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: (1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and (2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats, so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970 and 2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers, respectively), habitat fragmentation (37 papers), and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%), and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways. However, we speculate that rectifying the geographic and taxonomic bias of our current knowledge could significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of roads on lentic environments, thereby better informing environmental management of these important habitats. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Land allocation has been an important issue in land use planning research studies. Land allocation involves different multifunctional activities of maximizing environmental, economic and social benefits. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is the most popular tool to optimize land allocation problems by considering decision variables, conflicting objectives, and criteria. Hence, decision-makers face problems on how to optimize the land allocation while minimizing the conflicting trade-offs existing in the decision analysis. With this review study, we aim at identifying and extracting information on MCDM methods to solve land allocation problems from English language articles published between 2000 and 2019 and indexed by four scientific literature databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Google scholar). To this end, we applied a systematic literature review approach, i.e. the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis procedure (Moher et al., 2009), with a structured database search expression. 120 articles were selected of which, after careful screening of title, keywords and abstract, 69 were retained for detailed review. This review study report compiles comprehensive information by classifying the papers into application area, optimization objectives, criteria used, decision techniques, publication year and study region. In summary, we found that in the last two decades, the use of the MCDM method has increased, particularly in Europe and China. AHP (analytical hierarchal process) is frequently used for multi-attribute land allocation problems with reference to ecotourism and ecosystem management. LP (linear programming) and SA (simulating annealing) methods are predominantly used to optimize multi-objectives complex agricultural and forest land allocation problems respectively. © 2021 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water & Power Press

AU  - Sturtevant, B.R.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, affect the configuration, composition, and function of forested ecosystems. Complex system behaviors emerge from the interactions between disturbance regimes, the vegetation response to those disturbances, and their interplay with multiple drivers (climate, topography, land use, etc.) across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we summarize conceptual advances and empirical approaches to disturbance interaction investigation, and used those insights to evaluate and categorize 146 landscape modeling studies emerging from a systematic review of the literature published since 2010. Recent conceptual advances include formal disaggregation of disturbances into their constituent components, embedding disturbance processes into system dynamics, and clarifying terminology for interaction factors, types, and ecosystem responses. Empirical studies investigating disturbance interactions now span a wide range of approaches, including (most recently) advanced statistical methods applied to an expanding set of spatial and temporal datasets. Concurrent development in spatially-explicit landscape models, informed by these empirical insights, integrate the interactions among natural and anthropogenic disturbances by coupling these processes to account for disturbance stochasticity, disturbance within and across scales, and non-linear landscape responses to climate change. Still, trade-offs between model elegance and complexity remain. We developed an index for the degree of process integration (i.e., balance of static vs. dynamic components) within a given disturbance agent and applied it to the studies from our systematic review. Contemporary model applications in this line of research have applied a wide range process integration, depending on the specific question, but also limited in part by data and knowledge. Non-linear “threshold” behavior and cross-scaled interactions remain a frontier in temperate, boreal, and alpine regions of North America and Europe, while even simplistic studies are lacking from other regions of the globe (e.g., subtropical and tropical biomes). Understanding and planning for uncertainty in system behavior—including disturbance interactions—is paramount at a time of accelerated anthropogenic change. While progress in landscape modeling studies in this area is evident, work remains to increase model transparency and confidence, especially for understudied regions and processes. Moving forward, a multi-dimensional approach is recommended to address the uncertainties of complex human-ecological dynamics. © Copyright © 2021 Sturtevant and Fortin.

AB  - Context: Landscape connectivity plays a key role in determining the persistence of species inhabiting fragmented habitat patches. In dynamic landscapes, most studies measure connectivity at multiple time steps, but pay less attention to explicitly quantifying its temporal dynamics to gain insights into its role in biodiversity patterns, thereby enabling more effective operational outcomes. Objectives: This article aimed at making an overview of the existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity. By analysing their differences and possible applications, we aimed to highlight knowledge gap and future research directions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of literature dealing with the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity and obtained 32 studies. Results: We presented two main approaches based on graph theory and compared them from conceptual and operational perspectives. The first widely used approach, accounting only for the spatial dispersal of organisms, quantifies temporal changes in spatial connectivity. Based on two or multiple time steps in the time series, this approach enables assessment of the sense and magnitude of the temporal changes in spatial connectivity. The second recently developed approach quantifies spatio-temporal connectivity, thus accounting for both spatial and temporal dispersal. So far, this holistic assessment of spatio-temporal connectivity only covers two time steps. Conclusion: Existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity provide indicators to advance our understanding of biodiversity patterns, and to be able to implement measures to conserve and restore connectivity. We propose future directions to develop these methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marsh provide ecosystem services to mitigate climate change. The stored carbon is called blue carbon. To date, studies relating strategy to enhance blue carbon storage is emerging. In developing a strategy to be applied to a natural resource, it is necessary to consider how it is affected and influences its people's lives. Meanwhile, the studies related to blue carbon management's social aspects are lacking compared to technical and policy aspects. This paper aims to identify peer-reviewed documents that discuss social aspects in the context of blue carbon management. This study uses a semi-systematic review approach by reviewing relevant documents based on determined keyword search terms. This study suggests that livelihood, land tenure, local knowledge, and local capacity are essential to incorporate in blue carbon management. The strategy must enforce communities to hold a significant role in governance. Those aspects would help to increase community engagement to manage and support blue carbon management. However, more extensive practical studies are needed to apply strategies on the real subject to strengthen the theory in recent literature. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - The global decline in insect diversity is worrisome and little is known about insects’ response to land use change. Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) are megadiverse and a key component in ecosystem functioning as generalist predators in forest habitats and agroecosystems. These beetles are sensitive to environmental changes related to the modification of natural habitats, however there is still no consensus on their usefulness as potential ecological disturbance indicators. Through an exhaustive literature review and a global quantitative analysis, we evaluated the response of rove beetles to land use change in different biogeographic regions to see if these beetles can be used as an ecological disturbance indicator. Using Hill's series (qD), species density and the density of individuals, rove beetle response was evaluated for different types of land use ranging from native habitats to crops and urban zones. Rove beetle density and richness respond negatively to crops and pastures, but urban zones were as diverse as some native habitats. The magnitude of the response varied among biogeographic regions and appears to be related to the life history traits of the species that make up the beetle communities. The high degree of variation observed in the response of rove beetles might result from the lack of information about the influence of the landscape's characteristics on local response. The idea that the simplification of native habitats leads to a reduction in rove beetle density and diversity is partially supported. However, in order to generalize a pattern of rove beetle response to the global scale, it is necessary to standardize the protocol for comparative studies in addition to considering other community attributes (e.g. species composition). The use of Staphylinidae as a potential ecological disturbance indicator in human-dominated landscapes is widely discussed. © 2020 The Authors

T2  - Ecosystem Health and Sustainability
AB  - Context: Without clear understanding of the units used for ecosystem service (ES) mapping, ES assessment accuracy and the practical application of ES knowledge will be hampered. Method: We systematically reviewed 106 studies over the past 11 years to explore the type, characteristic pattern and deficiencies of mapping units. Result: We proposed that ES mapping units can be categorized into minimal unit for assessing ESs using corresponding indicators and methods, and aggregated unit for analysis and application based on research objectives, and classified the mapping units into five common types. Of the 12 characterizing variables of ES mapping studies, some have been shown to introduce a difference in the selection of mapping units and to exhibit characteristic patterns. We also found that the accuracy of ES assessments based on minimal units was lacking, and aggregated units were insufficient to establish a link between ES knowledge and practice. Conclusion: Herein, we propose possible solutions such as the use of fine spatial resolution grids and the introduction of additional data beyond land cover as supplements to improve the assessment accuracy. To enhance the availability of the results for practice, aggregated units connected with urban planning units should be established at a spatial level suitable for urban management. © 2021 The Author(s).

T2  - Human Ecology Review
AB  - The failure of centralized forest management at conserving forests and their biodiversity has made a decentralized forest management approach such as community forest management (CFM) preferable in many parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, however, CFM is relatively new. The aim of this systematic review is to examine current studies of CFM in Southeast Asia pertaining to the impacts on biodiversity conservation and livelihood quality of local communities. The data for this research were taken from citation and scientific literature databases within the 2000–2020 timeframe. Results indicate that research studies on CFM and its impacts are increasing in Southeast Asia in terms of numbers, yet there is a lack of a common terminology throughout the region. This study suggests that knowledge exchange is made possible through CFM, which will empower local communities and increase their awareness of conservation values compatible with their traditional knowledge and their subsistence needs. © 2021, Society for Human Ecology.

AB  - Debate about what proportion of the Earth to protect often overshadows the question of how nature should be conserved and by whom. We present a systematic review and narrative synthesis of 169 publications investigating how different forms of governance influence conservation outcomes, paying particular attention to the role played by Indigenous peoples and local communities. We find a stark contrast between the outcomes produced by externally controlled conservation, and those produced by locally controlled efforts. Crucially, most studies presenting positive outcomes for both well-being and conservation come from cases where Indigenous peoples and local communities play a central role, such as when they have substantial influence over decision making or when local institutions regulating tenure form a recognized part of governance. In contrast, when interventions are controlled by external organizations and involve strategies to change local practices and supersede customary institutions, they tend to result in relatively ineffective conservation at the same time as producing negative social outcomes. Our findings suggest that equitable conservation, which empowers and supports the environmental stewardship of Indigenous peoples and local communities represents the primary pathway to effective long-term conservation of biodiversity, particularly when upheld in wider law and policy. Whether for protected areas in biodiversity hotspots or restoration of highly modified ecosystems, whether involving highly traditional or diverse and dynamic local communities, conservation can become more effective through an increased focus on governance type and quality, and fostering solutions that reinforce the role, capacity, and rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities. We detail how to enact progressive governance transitions through recommendations for conservation policy, with immediate relevance for how to achieve the next decade’s conservation targets under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. © 2021 by the author(s).

AB  - Natural forests were increasingly replaced by plantations globally. While plantations support less biodiversity compared to natural forests, they can serve as an important habitat for forest-dependent species. Understanding the key drivers of the habitat function of plantations is necessary to reconcile both forestry and biodiversity. Planted tree species is one of the important factors determining biodiversity of plantations. Here, we systematically collected studies comparing the biodiversity between conifer plantations and natural forests, and conducted meta-analyses to quantify the effects of planted tree family/species (cypress family: Japanese cedar Cryptomeria japonica, Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtuse; pine family: Japanese larch Larix kaempferi, Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora, Todo fir Abies sachalinensis) on abundance and species richness of a wide range of taxa (all taxa, vertebrates, birds, invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, plants, and understorey plants) in plantations in Japan. Abundance and species richness in plantations relative to natural forests differed among planted tree family/species. In plantations of pine family (mainly larch), abundance or richness did not significantly differ from those in natural forests for many taxa, suggesting the important role as habitats. By contrast, in cypress family (mainly cedar), abundance or richness was significantly lower than in natural forests for all analysis groups except understorey abundance. These results indicate that the habitat function of plantations and its management should be considered for each planted tree species, separately. Nevertheless, since our literature review identifies some research gaps, e.g. studies on vertebrates in western Japan were scarce, more comprehensive research efforts should be made in the future. © 2021 The Japanese Forest Society.

TI  - Can biochar reclaim coal mine spoil?
AU  - Ghosh, D.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Surface coal mining activities completely destroy vegetation cover, soil and biodiversity. The aftermaths include huge coal mine spoil dumps, changed topography, drainage and landscape, deteriorated aesthetics and increased pollution load. These coal mine spoils are characterised by high rock fragments, extremely low water holding capacity, compacted and high bulk density, lack of organic carbon and plant nutrients, low cation exchange capacity, acidic pH and toxic metal contamination, which poses difficulties in reclamation. An array of studies has been focused on the sustainable use of biochar for restoration of degraded agricultural soil by improving the soil physicochemical, nutritional and biological properties. Although a volume of studies has been done on biochar application, its specialised application in reclamation of coal mine spoils is still atypical, also a systematic review on the mechanism by which biochar amends the mine spoil is lacking. This review focuses on i) factors affecting the biochar properties, ii) the mechanism involved in altering the physical, chemical and biological properties by biochar, (iii) remediation of potentially toxic elements in soil and restoration of degraded land using biochar, and, iv) highlighting the important aspects to be considered while using biochar for reclamation of coal mine spoil. Biochar prepared at 450 °C from a lignocellulosic rich biomass can be an alternative for reclamation for coal mine spoil. Review also suggested suitable methodologies for bulk production, application and economics of biochar in coal mine spoil reclamation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Behavior Change in Urban Mammals: A Systematic Review
AU  - Ritzel, K.
AU  - Gallo, T.
T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - As cities expand to accommodate a growing human population, their impacts to natural ecosystems and the wildlife residing within them increase. Some animals that persist in urban environments demonstrate behaviors distinct from their non-urban counterparts. These potential behavioral changes are the subject of a growing body of research in the areas of wildlife ecology, biology, and conservation. In spite of increasing urban wildlife research, studies focused specifically on changing behavior in urban mammals is limited. We conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize current research on behavior changes in wild urban mammals. We included 83 papers published between 1987 and March 2020. Omnivores were the leading subject of study, closely followed by carnivores and the specific behaviors most widely studied were home range and vigilance. Among the reviewed studies, there were 166 observations of 44 distinct behaviors with 155 occurrences of behavior change relative to conspecifics in non-urban areas. The most commonly studied and observed type of behavior change was alert behavior. Results indicate urban environments drive adaptive responses in behavior including changes in home range and diet preference, shifts in activity budget and vigilance, decreased flight initiation distance, and increased nocturnal activity. Some urban mammal species even demonstrated the ability to modulate behaviors based on environmental cues. Our results highlight the need for long-term wildlife behavior studies across a variety of urban settings to promote successful urban wildlife management and conservation. © Copyright © 2020 Ritzel and Gallo.

AB  - Temporal aspects of ecosystem services have gained surprisingly little attention given that ecosystem service flows are not static but change over time. We present the first systematic review to describe and establish how studies have assessed temporal patterns in supply and demand of ecosystem services. 295 studies, 2% of all studies engaging with the ecosystem service concept, considered changes in ecosystem services over time. Changes were mainly characterised as monotonic and linear (81%), rather than non-linear or through system shocks. Further, a lack of focus of changing ecosystem service demand (rather than supply) hampers our understanding of the temporal patterns of ecosystem services provision and use. Future studies on changes in ecosystem services over time should (1) more explicitly study temporal patterns, (2) analyse trade-offs and synergies between services over time, and (3) integrate changes in supply and demand and involve and empower stakeholders in temporal ecosystem services research. © 2019, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is a known source of disturbance to many wildlife populations. We systematically reviewed 126 relevant papers that study the impact of outdoor recreation on wildlife, focusing on terrestrial wildlife (birds excluded) to assess the different methodological approaches adopted by researchers. We characterised the research methods into seven categories (direct observation, indirect observation (field-based), telemetry, camera traps, physiological measurement, trapping, and simulation). We find that direct observation is the most commonly used method to capture human-wildlife interactions, followed by the use of telemetry, and camera traps. The animals most commonly studied were ungulates, and the orders Carnivora and Rodentia. Studies typically captured data over longer periods (median 54 months) when using trapping methods; other methods exhibited shorter study durations (median 22 months). The size of the animal under study appears to influence how methods are chosen, with larger species often being studied using telemetry methods. We highlight advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on the aims of the study, the focal species, and the type of outdoor recreation. Our review highlights the need for simultaneous measurements of both human activity and wildlife response. We also recommend that researchers consider how to capture both short- and long-term impacts on animal welfare. Our findings should guide applied wildlife conservation and management research in scenarios where human-wildlife interactions lead to conservation issues. © 2020

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Urban areas are growing worldwide and alter landscapes in a persistent fashion, thereby affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination in a little understood way. Here we present a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to identify the drivers of urban pollinator populations and pollination. A total of 141 studies were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed. Pollinator responses to urbanization were contrasting. We contend that positive responses were often associated with urban sprawl, i.e. moderate levels of urbanization of rural, mostly agricultural land below 50% impervious surface, whereas high levels of densification with high percentages of sealed and built-up area (above 50%), largely led to pollinator declines and loss of pollination services. Further, urbanization generally reduced pollinator diversity when compared to natural or semi-natural areas, but enhanced it when compared to intensified agricultural landscapes. In addition, pollinator responses were commonly highly trait- and scale-specific. Cavity nesters and generalist species usually profited more from urbanization than ground nesters and specialists. Overall, urban pollinator communities still seem to provide sufficient pollination services to wild vegetation and crops. Pollinator diversity generally increased with the amount of urban green spaces at the landscape scale, and locally with availability of nesting resources and flowering plants. Positive effects of floral additions were largely independent of the plant's origin, whether native or non-native. Only a few studies included landscape configuration. Likewise, abiotic urban drivers, e.g. heat island effects and air and light pollution, remain little studied. Tropical and developing regions, most heavily impacted by current and future urbanization, are strongly underrepresented. We conclude that biodiversity-friendly urbanization can make a valuable contribution to pollinator conservation, in particular in face of the continued intensification of rural agriculture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Semi-arid and arid landscapes (dry-lands) cover 41% of the Earth’s land surface over five continents. These areas are home to 55% of mammal species. Bats have the second highest species richness among mammals, and, although many species are adapted to arid conditions, they are particularly sensitive in these habitats and require conservation priority. Information on bats in arid and semi-arid landscapes is scattered, patchy and focused on small-scale studies; therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect knowledge gaps and propose future research priorities. We analysed 346 published articles and evaluated 40 topics within five topic categories (taxa studied, methodologies used, biology, ecology and conservation). The most commonly studied topic categories were ecology and biology. However, we found a gap in the topic category conservation (including topics such as conservation status and roost conservation). Our network analysis of topics within the categories showed that most ecology papers were focused on distribution, species richness and habitat use. When we analysed keywords, we found that phylogeny, taxonomy and distribution demonstrated relatively high presence. Moreover, comparison of the percentage of studies conducted in dry-lands and the percentage of land surface area covered by dry-lands in the continents revealed that dry-lands in Africa and Australia were especially under-represented. Our review shows that knowledge of bats in semi-arid and arid landscapes is biased towards new records of the distribution of species, as well as covering systematic/taxonomic and morphological aspects of bat biology. We suggest that research on conservation measures and guidelines to protect the bat species found in semi-arid and arid landscapes should be prioritised, together with the sharing of knowledge with local practitioners and the development of citizen science programmes. © 2019 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AU  - Liczner, A.R.

T2  - Journal of Insect Conservation
AB  - Some bumble bee species are in decline globally. Declines have been attributed to many factors including habitat loss. Habitat is an integral component of any species and should be a central focus of conservation efforts to protect at risk species. However, the habitat of bumble bee species is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature using Web of Science to summarize articles that have described the habitat of bumble bee species. In total, 55 nesting and 10 overwintering habitat studies are described in this review. We described common patterns associated with bumble bee studies including overwintering habitat, landscape type, and ground position. We found that bumble bee nests are more frequently found underground and that studies were biased towards the United Kingdom and agricultural habitats. There are some preferences in nesting and overwintering habitat, but further research is needed to draw any substantial conclusions. Detection of nesting and overwintering site studies may be improved using citizen science initiatives and possibly through employing detection dogs or radio-telemetry. Increasing the detection of nesting and overwintering sites is an important priority to improve our understanding of bumble bee habitat. It is critical that we identify all aspects of bumble bee habitat to ensure the protection, restoration and creation of important resources to ensure their conservation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Natural systems are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors and so understanding the interactive threats posed by multiple stressors is essential. In this study we focused on urban stressors that are ubiquitous to urban estuarine systems worldwide: elevated nutrients, toxic chemical contaminants, built infrastructure and non-indigenous species (NIS). We investigated structural (abundance, diversity and species richness) and functional endpoints (productivity, primary production (chlorophyll-a) and metabolism) commonly used to determine responses to these selected stressors. Through a systematic review of global literature, we found 579 studies of our selected stressors; 93% measured responses to a single stressor, with few assessing the effects of multiple stressors (7%). Structural endpoints were commonly used to measure the effects of stressors (49% of the total 579 studies). Whereas, functional endpoints were rarely assessed alone (10%) but rather in combination with structural endpoints (41%). Elevated nutrients followed by NIS were the most studied single stressors (43% and 16% of the 541 single stressor studies), while elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants were overwhelmingly the most common stressor combination (79% of the 38 multiple stressor studies); with NIS and built infrastructure representing major gaps in multi-stressor research. In the meta-analysis, structural endpoints tended to decrease, while functional endpoints increased and/or decreased in response to different types of organisms or groups. We predicted an antagonistic effect of elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants based on the opposing enriching versus toxic effects of this stressor combination. Of note, biodiversity was the only endpoint that revealed such an antagonistic response. Our results highlight the continuing paucity of multiple stressor studies and provide evidence for opposing patterns in the responses to single and interacting stressors depending on the measured endpoint. The latter is of significant consequence to understanding relevant impacts of stressors in coastal monitoring and management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Unsustainable practices in the land use sector contribute to climate change through the release of greenhouse gases. Payment for environmental services (PESs) provide economic incentives to reduce the negative environmental impacts of land use and are a popular approach to mitigate climate change in low- and middle-income countries. Some PES programmes also aim to improve socioeconomic outcomes and reduce poverty. This systematic review examines the effect of programmes on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. We identified 44 quantitative impact evaluations and 60 qualitative studies of PES programmes for inclusion in the review, to assess both the effects of PES and identify context, design and implementation features that may influence PES effectiveness. The studies covered 18 programmes from 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The review finds that PES may increase household income, reduce deforestation and improve forest cover, but the findings are, however, based on low and very low quality evidence from a small number of programmes and should be treated with caution. Qualitative evidence indicates that several factors influence whether PES programmes are likely to be effective in different contexts and suggests that the inclusion of strong governance structures and the effective targeting of both locations and participants may improve intervention effectiveness. Funders, implementing agencies and researchers should collaborate to develop a coordinated programme of rigorous, mixed-methods impact evaluation implemented across contexts. Until such evidence is available, PES programmes remain a high-risk strategy for climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Infiltration is one of the most important hydrological processes in ecosystems, having important influence on soil erosion control and runoff, soil moisture content and groundwater recharge. This is particularly important considering the recent growing number of restoration initiatives worldwide encouraging forest cover expansion, mainly by tree planting. Here, we conducted a systematic review of scientific literature reporting infiltration measurements in forests restored by tree planting in the tropics and subtropics. We found 11 studies representing 67 data comparisons in eight countries. Overall results indicate that infiltration increases but is not fully recovered to reference conditions in forests restored by tree planting. Recovery of infiltration varied depending on land-use, soil texture and restoration age. Recovery of infiltration was higher for cultivated than for pastures and bare soils. Clayey soils had higher infiltration recovery than sandy soils. Our findings identified some knowledge gaps that should be addressed to improve our understanding of when and why tree planting to restore forests may promote the recovery of infiltration in tropical and subtropical soils. First, information about recovery of infiltration capacities when using tree planting for forest restoration results are scarce. Second, infiltration in restored forests should be monitored over time, including long-term studies and measurements on water movement through the soil profile and evaluating potential interactions between infiltration and soil attributes. Details on the effects that different forest restoration techniques (e.g., soil preparation, tree species diversity and densities)could have on infiltration is virtually unknown. Information on the influence of disturbance level on infiltration prior to tree planting is also severely lacking. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in naturally assembled communities
AU  - van der Plas, F.
T2  - Biological Reviews
AB  - Approximately 25 years ago, ecologists became increasingly interested in the question of whether ongoing biodiversity loss matters for the functioning of ecosystems. As such, a new ecological subfield on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) was born. This subfield was initially dominated by theoretical studies and by experiments in which biodiversity was manipulated, and responses of ecosystem functions such as biomass production, decomposition rates, carbon sequestration, trophic interactions and pollination were assessed. More recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated BEF relationships in non-manipulated ecosystems, but reviews synthesizing our knowledge on the importance of real-world biodiversity are still largely missing. I performed a systematic review in order to assess how biodiversity drives ecosystem functioning in both terrestrial and aquatic, naturally assembled communities, and on how important biodiversity is compared to other factors, including other aspects of community composition and abiotic conditions. The outcomes of 258 published studies, which reported 726 BEF relationships, revealed that in many cases, biodiversity promotes average biomass production and its temporal stability, and pollination success. For decomposition rates and ecosystem multifunctionality, positive effects of biodiversity outnumbered negative effects, but neutral relationships were even more common. Similarly, negative effects of prey biodiversity on pathogen and herbivore damage outnumbered positive effects, but were less common than neutral relationships. Finally, there was no evidence that biodiversity is related to soil carbon storage. Most BEF studies focused on the effects of taxonomic diversity, however, metrics of functional diversity were generally stronger predictors of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, in most studies, abiotic factors and functional composition (e.g. the presence of a certain functional group) were stronger drivers of ecosystem functioning than biodiversity per se. While experiments suggest that positive biodiversity effects become stronger at larger spatial scales, in naturally assembled communities this idea is too poorly studied to draw general conclusions. In summary, a high biodiversity in naturally assembled communities positively drives various ecosystem functions. At the same time, the strength and direction of these effects vary highly among studies, and factors other than biodiversity can be even more important in driving ecosystem functioning. Thus, to promote those ecosystem functions that underpin human well-being, conservation should not only promote biodiversity per se, but also the abiotic conditions favouring species with suitable trait combinations. © 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban forest modeling is becoming increasingly complex, global, and transdisciplinary. Increased modeling of urban forest structure and function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the similarities and differences between modeling techniques and applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales, compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met, computational fluid dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors. Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem services. Such knowledge is critical for policy- and decision-makers, and can help improve urban forest planning, design and management. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Cities are complex systems where many factors interconnect, therefore multidisciplinary research is crucial to understand their functional capacity and to improve the quality of life that these spaces offer. This research provides a decade of scientific literature review (2006 to 2016) about urban forest, air quality and health. This review aims to increase the discussion of the importance of multidisciplinary research in urban studies. In total we found 236 papers, from which 50 were selected for the systematic analyses. The number of multidisciplinary research papers is scarce in general, however, it has been growing in recent years. Most studies are found in the United States and China, a few in Latin America, but no studies have been reported in Africa. Few studies approached the three themes aforementioned simultaneously, which highlights the importance of strengthening a multidisciplinary approach for international urban forest research, creating results that allow integration of urban forest environments. © 2019 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

AB  - Selective logging is the dominant timber harvesting practice in natural tropical forests. Considering its scale and its contribution to forest management outcome, efficient management of selective logging is crucial to address challenges associated with timber demand, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Ongoing selective logging has been a key reason for forest degradation despite a set of recommended practices such as reduced-impact logging. With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders’ capacity. Our review suggests a broadening of the geographical and thematic focus of the study as well as a consideration of effective engagement and capacity development of the forest managers/owners and stakeholders in selective logging policies and practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reintroduction of beaver (Castor spp) may facilitate rehabilitation of freshwater habitats providing a cost-effective sustainable means of improving ecological conditions. Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat.

TI  - Are hedgerows effective corridors between fragments of woodland habitat? An evidence-based approach
AU  - Davies, ZG
AU  - Pullin, AS
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic modification of the countryside has resulted in much of the landscape consisting of fragments of once continuous habitat. Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or longterm monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation. The benefits of such corridors in regard to increasing habitat connectivity remain equivocal, and the role of corridors in mitigating the effects of climate change at the landscape-scale is even less well understood.

TI  - Find New RoadsTM A Systematic Review on the Impacts of Off-Road Vehicle Activity on Soil, Vegetation, and Wildlife
AU  - Ploughe, LW
AU  - Fraser, LH
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The global use of off-road vehicles (ORVs) in natural environments has accelerated rapidly over the last few decades, resulting in significant social and environmental consequences. As the demand, use, and promotion of light-duty ORVs like all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, four-wheel drive trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) increases in remote wilderness, the landscape is becoming fragmented into disorganized and destructive networks of trails and roads. Substantial ecological impacts to a wide range of ecosystem structures and functions will likely result from ORV activity. Applying a global systematic review, we examine 105 publications about plant, soil, and wildlife responses to ORV traffic in different habitats to help guide the direction of future research, monitoring programs, and mitigation efforts. Most studies investigated impacts to animals, followed by soils, then vegetative responses. Soil studies primarily focused on physical impacts to the soil (i.e., compaction, erosion, rut depth), but some studies suggest that soil chemical and biological properties may also be impacted by ORV traffic. The literature on plant responses to ORV activities primarily explored vegetation loss, although impacts on the plant community were also investigated. Animal studies investigated impacts of ORV use on invertebrates, mammals, birds, and to a lesser extent reptiles/amphibians, including population-level, community-level, and behavioral responses. Overall, research on environmental impacts of ORV traffic is biased to coastal and desert ecosystems in the northern hemisphere (primarily in the US), often does not address mechanisms that may produce ecological impacts (e.g., intensity of vehicular disturbance and ecosystem- or species-specific sensitivity to ORV activities), and frequently focused on short-term responses. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms that cause the different responses of soil, plant, and animals to ORVs over the long-term in a broad range of ecosystems to support real-time management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change. By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities.        Location: Worldwide.        Time period: Contemporary.        Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates.        Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure.        Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America.        Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates. Additionally, our findings provide an impetus for determining the mechanisms associated with changes in vertebrate diversity and abundance in shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes.

TI  - Strategic plant choices can alleviate climate change impacts: A review
AU  - Espeland, EK
AU  - Kettenring, KM
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) uses biodiversity and ecosystem services to reduce climate change impacts to local communities. Because plants can alleviate the abiotic and biotic stresses of climate change, purposeful plant choices could improve adaptation. However, there has been no systematic review of how plants can be applied to alleviate effects of climate change. Here we describe how plants can modify climate change effects by altering biological and physical processes. Plant effects range from increasing soil stabilization to reducing the impact of flooding and storm surges. Given the global scale of plant-related activities such as farming, landscaping, forestry, conservation, and restoration, plants can be selected strategically Le., planting and maintaining particular species with desired impacts to simultaneously restore degraded ecosystems, conserve ecosystem function, and help alleviate effects of climate change. Plants are a tool for EbA that should be more broadly and strategically utilized.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is highly dependent on dynamic river systems at all life stages. However, anthropogenic pressures have modified natural river landscapes, reducing their extent and causing severe limitations to the natural recruitment of riparian species. In particular, the recruitment of Salix species (willows) is highly dependent on fluvial processes. A comprehensive understanding of the drivers of Salix recruitment is crucial to effectively restore and conserve riparian biodiversity. To date however, there has been no systematic review of the drivers of Salix recruitment in riparian ecosystems. We provide a synthesis of Salix recruitment requirements from the scientific literature throughout the world. Our results show that the proportion of species studied compared to existing species is low worldwide, revealing a need for more research on Salix recruitment. We identified 19 abiotic factors concerning Salix recruitment, which we classified into four groups. The most studied abiotic factors are those related to soil (35%) and hydrology (25%). Within those categories, soil moisture and flow regime are the most frequently studied, while interstitial soil temperature, precipitation, geomorphologic dynamism, and atmospheric CO2 content are among the least studied factors. We identified 6 types of environmental pressures. Flow regulation followed by invasive vegetation competition are the most studied pressures, while the effects of climate change and extreme climatic events on willow recruitment have received little attention. Additionally, there has been little consideration of the interactions of multiple anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, we recommend comparative studies and experiments including several species to fill this knowledge gap. Our synthesis of the factors that influence Salix recruitment, such as optimal temperature ranges and elevations, can be incorporated into management practices to promote successful native riparian tree regeneration. Further research on how both abiotic factors and anthropogenic pressures affect Salix regeneration would greatly contribute to conservation of fluvial landscapes, and increase the success of restoration initiatives.

TI  - A systematic review of ecological attributes that confer resilience to climate change in environmental restoration
AU  - Timpane-Padgham, BL
AU  - Beechie, T
AU  - Klinger, T
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual-(9), population-(6), community-(7), ecosystem-(7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species-or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.

AB  - ContextVector-borne diseases (VBD) are a worldwide public health problem for humans and wildlife. 'Global Change' such as habitat alteration and land-use intensification, biotic exchange, the introduction of invasive alien species, and climate change have all been linked to an increased occurrence of VBDs.ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) on the transmission of VBDs, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature on the global effects of land use on VBDs. This was followed by a meta-analysis to test the relationship between LULC intensification and infection prevalence.MethodsOverall, 654 articles met our inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review, and 18 studies fulfilled the requirements for the meta-analysis.ResultsThe systematic literature review identified 162 articles with a total of 2541 data entries on the effect of LULC on VBDs. The majority of the studies were published after 2010, and the spatial distribution of data was biased towards North America and Europe. Overall, 193 different hosts and 144 different vector groups were identified. Avian and human malaria were the most frequently named diseases, with humans and Anopheles mosquitoes the most common host and vector, respectively. Our meta-analysis found that land-use intensity, as well as targets (host and vector), significantly impact the prevalence of VBDs. Tests for both residual heterogeneity and moderators were significant, where lower land-use intensity and vectors were linked to lower VBD prevalence, while medium land-use intensity was associated with higher prevalence. Analysis of the host sub-model supported these findings, with infection prevalence significantly lower in low land-use intensity.ConclusionsThe systematic literature review revealed a temporal increase in publications on this topic, with a significant rise since 2007 and uneven distribution of data across countries, with the United States, Spain, and Brazil being the most prominent contributors and identified a wide range of pathogens and hosts involved in VBD systems, with human and avian malaria being the most commonly mentioned diseases. We also show, through a meta-analysis, that LULC intensification affects VBDs infection prevalence. Future studies should incorporate the effects of land-use intensity on vector-borne diseases in diverse ecosystems to inform management strategies and mitigate disease emergence with implications for human, livestock and wildlife health.

T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important tool to evaluate environmental 'hot spots' in livestock systems and recommend production improvements. However, it is common for livestock LCA to investigate only a narrow subset of environmental impacts to simplify results for decision-makers, which makes it difficult to fully understand the tradeoffs among environmental impacts and identify the most relevant mitigation options. We completed a systematic review of the livestock LCA literature to better understand the impact categories included and the progress made towards more comprehensive LCA. Our search of publications between 2000 and 2016 identified 173 relevant peer-reviewed papers. Nearly all the publications (98%) included climate change as an impact category and almost one-third of the publications (28%) focused solely on that one category. Biodiversity, ionizing radiation, and particulate matter were the least common categories addressed. Cattle LCA, including dairy or beef, were the livestock species most frequently evaluated. Our analysis shows that while the number of multi-category livestock LCA (LCA with 4 or more impact categories) increased over time, LCA including 1-3 impact categories (which we define as "simplified LCA") increased at a higher rate than multi-category LCA. Simplified LCA therefore remain the most prevalent in the literature. Publications that included multiple impact categories were better able to identify environmental impact tradeoffs among livestock production systems and management scenarios. To compare results across livestock LCA studies, it is necessary to increase the standardization of system boundaries, functional units, impact frameworks and mandatory inputs. The optional steps of normalization and weighting in the life cycle impact assessment can also help decision makers prioritize which environmental impacts to address. More work that includes a greater number of impact categories in livestock LCA is sorely needed to more fully understand and to harmonize the communication of the environmental performance of livestock production systems.

T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Persistence of restored populations depends on growth, reproduction, dispersal, local adaptation, and a suitable landscape pattern to foster metapopulation dynamics. Although the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on plant population dynamics are well understood, particularly in grasslands, the population traits that control grassland restoration are less known. We reviewed the use of population traits for evaluating grassland restoration success based on 141 publications (1986-2015). The results demonstrated that population demography was relatively well-assessed but detailed studies providing information on key stages of the life cycle were lacking despite their importance in determining population viability. Vegetative and generative performances have been thoroughly investigated, notably the components of plant fitness, such as reproductive output, while genetic and spatial population structures were largely ignored. More work on the population effects of ecological restoration would be welcomed, particularly with a focus on population genetics. Targeted species were principally common and dominant natives, or invasive plants while rare or threatened species were poorly considered. Evaluation of ecological restoration should be conducted at different scales of ecological complexity, but so far, communities and ecosystems are over represented, and more focus should be directed towards a population approach as population traits are essential indicators of restoration success.

TI  - Trophic disruption: a meta-analysis of how habitat fragmentation affects resource consumption in terrestrial arthropod systems
AU  - Martinson, HM

T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a complex process that affects ecological systems in diverse ways, altering everything from population persistence to ecosystem function. Despite widespread recognition that habitat fragmentation can influence food web interactions, consensus on the factors underlying variation in the impacts of fragmentation across systems remains elusive. In this study, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation and spatial habitat structure on resource consumption in terrestrial arthropod food webs. Across 419 studies, we found a negative overall effect of fragmentation on resource consumption. Variation in effect size was extensive but predictable. Specifically, resource consumption was reduced on small, isolated habitat fragments, higher at patch edges, and neutral with respect to landscape-scale spatial variables. In general, resource consumption increased in fragmented settings for habitat generalist consumers but decreased for specialist consumers. Our study demonstrates widespread disruption of trophic interactions in fragmented habitats and describes variation among studies that is largely predictable based on the ecological traits of the interacting species. We highlight future prospects for understanding how changes in spatial habitat structure may influence trophic modules and food webs.

AU  - Harris, ZM

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were used to assess the current state of knowledge and quantify the effects of land use change (LUC) to second generation (2G), non-food bioenergy crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of relevance to temperate zone agriculture. Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 +/- 7.8% and +25.7 +/- 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 +/- 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 +/- 4.3% and -11.4 +/- 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further longterm data sets are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.

AU  - Koffler, S
AU  - Kleinert, ADP

T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS
AB  - Quantitative genetic traits provide insights into the evolutionary potential of populations, as heritability estimates measure the population's ability to respond to global changes. Although wild and managed bees are increasingly threatened by the degradation of natural habitats and climate change, risking plant biodiversity and agriculture production, no study has yet performed a systematic review of heritability estimates across the group. Here we help fill this knowledge gap, gathering all available heritability estimates for ants, bees, and wasps, evaluating which factors affect these estimates and assessing the reported genetic correlations between traits. Using a model selection approach to analyze a dataset of more than 800 heritability estimates, we found that heritability is influenced by trait type, with morphological traits exhibiting the highest heritability estimates, and defense and metabolism-related traits showing the lowest estimates. Study system, sociality degree, experimental design, estimation type (narrow or broad-sense heritability), and sample size were not found to affect heritability estimates. Results remained unaltered when correcting for phylogenetic inertia, and when analyzing social bees separately. Genetic correlations between honeybee traits revealed both positive coefficients, usually for traits in the same category, and negative coefficients, suggesting trade-offs among other traits. We discuss these findings and highlight the importance of maintaining genetic variance in fitness-related traits. Our study shows the importance of considering heritability estimates and genetic correlations when designing breeding and conservation programs. We hope this meta-analysis helps identify sustainable breeding approaches and conservation strategies that help safeguard the evolutionary potential of wild and managed bees.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soil invertebrates have an essential role in decomposition, nutrient turnover and soil structure formation, all of which are strongly threatened by urbanization. Sealing, compaction by trampling and pollution destroy and degrade city soils and potentially damage soil-living invertebrates. The existing literature on how urbanization affects soil invertebrates is inconsistent, presenting both negative and positive effects. Therefore, here we aimed to synthesize the effects of urbanization on soil invertebrates considering their taxonomic (Acari, Annelida, Carabidae, Collembola, Gastropoda, Isopoda, Myriapoda, Nematoda) and functional (soil living vs. soil-related; mobility) identities, as well as to examine how the overall effect is modulated by climatic conditions (total annual precipitation, annual mean ambient temperature), urban heat island effect (based on ambient temperature differences between urban and rural areas) and city population. In a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses, we extracted 158 effect sizes from 75 studies on abundance and 125 effect sizes from84 studies on species richness. Invertebrate abundance showed an increase (r= 0.085), whereas species richness significantly decreased with increasing urbanization (r=-0.168). The reason behind this could be that a few generalist species can adapt well to the urban environment and achieve strongly elevated densities. The species richness of annelids (r = -0.301), springtails (r = -0.579), and snails (r=-0.233) decreased with advancing urbanization, most probably because these animals are sensitive to soil compaction and pollution, both of which are common consequences of urbanization. The temperature did not modify the effects of urbanization, but precipitation modified the effects on abundance (r=-0.457). Abundance increased with advancing urbanization in drier climates, probably because irrigation increased soil moisture, whereas it decreased in wet climates, as urban areas were drier than their surroundings. Making future citiesmore climate-neutral could better sustain soil biodiversity.

AB  - Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Land-use restrictions in protected areas (PAs) might have unintended spillover effects on non-target, neighboring areas. In the case of leakage, land-use change that would have occurred in the PA is displaced to an unprotected area where it would not have otherwise occurred. The resultant 'leakages' can offset benefits achieved inside PAs, confound impact assessments, and exacerbate the problems of opportunistic protection of lands. Conversely, in the case of 'blockage', the unprotected surroundings experience less land-use change than would have otherwise occurred due to a positive spillover effect from nearby protected areas. Little is known about the magnitude, ubiquity, and predictability of spillovers that have already occurred in the global PA network. Here we systematically review the literature and collate the existing evidence to quantify deforestation spillovers. We calculated deforestation rates within 3,398 PAs, most of which were found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, and in their unprotected adjacent surroundings and compared these rates to a baseline derived from the wider landscape. Of the 2,575 PAs that effectively restricted deforestation rates within their bounds relative to the baseline, 11.8% showed leakage and 54.8% exhibited blockage. Deforestation rates in the remaining 33.4% were indistinguishable from their respective baselines. Linear modelling of the correlates of leakage and blockage showed that PA-specific characteristics like size and IUCN category were uninformative, whereas national-scale socioeconomic factors like population density and GDP were useful predictors. Although spillovers from land-use restrictions are ultimately driven by socioeconomic factors, their ecological consequences are such that PA assessments should routinely and explicitly account for displaced impacts to the unprotected surroundings.

T2  - Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America
AB  - Browning of surface waters, also known as brownification, is a process of decreasing water transparency, particularly in boreal lakes surrounded by intensively managed forests and wetlands. In this paper, we review the ecological consequences and ecosystem-based management (EBM) of browning through a systematic review approach and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to formulating new governance of this complex phenomenon. To understand the effects of browning on the recreational value of freshwaters, we present primary survey data on public perceptions of recreational fishing tourists on water quality in Finland. We identify a need to develop EBM beyond the EU's Water Framework Directive (WFD) to fully account for the extensive implications of browning. We also highlight the need for a better understanding of the within-lake microbial processes to estimate the browning-associated changes in the greenhouse gas balance of lakes. Tourist perceptions of the quality of waterbodies in Finland were largely in agreement with the general proportion of waterbodies classified in a good or excellent ecological status class, but these perceptions may be detached from biological quality assessment criteria. Consequently, we suggest that the EBM of inland waters should improve the utilization of information on not only biogeochemical processes but also users' perspectives on aquatic ecosystems beyond the EU WFD.

AB  - Hydropower is commonly considered a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, this does not imply an absence of impacts on the riverine ecosystem, the extent of which is expected to increase in the coming years due to the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources and for the climate change. A common consequence of hydroelectric power generation is hydropeaking, which causes rapid and frequent fluctuations in the water flow downstream of hydropower plants. The review incorporates 155 relevant studies published up until November 2023 and follows a systematic review method, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which is a multi-stage systematic procedure for the identification and selection of research documents. The selected studies highlighted several prominent impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic environments. The primary effects include alterations in flow patterns, modification of water temperature, changes in sediment dynamics and fluctuations in dissolved gas levels. These alterations have been found to affect various aspects of aquatic ecosystems, including fish growth, behavior, reproductive success, habitat, and migration patterns, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, hydropeaking can also lead to habitat fragmentation, erosion, and loss of riparian vegetation, thereby impacting terrestrial ecosystems that depend on the aquatic environment. Despite the body of literature reviewed, several knowledge gaps were identified, underscoring the need for further research. There is limited understanding of the long-term ecological consequences of hydropeaking and its cumulative effects on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, there is lack of consensus regarding the quantification of ecosystem services, economic impact, soil moisture content, and weighted usable area due to flow fluctuation and global evolution of energy production from renewable energy sources. Addressing the identified research gaps is crucial for achieving a balance between energy production and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in the context of a rapidly changing global climate. © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) are regarded as crucial instruments for biodiversity conservation as they connect landscapes across country borders. The TFCA framework is built on multi-actor, multi-sector and multi-level negotiations, a concept that incorporates principles of landscape governance (LG). This article is driven by our interest in the governance of transfrontier landscapes such as the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. The study aims to explore the narratives of two academic discourses of TFCA and LG. The study uses a bibliometric analysis and systematic review based on PRISMA to determine (i) to which degree the two discourses share commonalities in their narratives and take each other into account (ii) how the discourses have developed between 1998 and 2022 (iii) the geographical distribution of publications on the two discourses. Our results identified six clusters which include: African Wildlife Conservation, Governance for Biodiversity Conservation, TFCA Wildlife Connectivity, Policies and Strategies, Political Ecology, and Management of Protected Areas. The discourses depict commonalities attributed to conservation, power and actor roles. However, LG is more governance-oriented while TFCA is more skewed towards wildlife management. The TFCA discourse is a more Southern African-centred debate whilst the LG debate is more rooted in the global North resulting from unique challenges, priorities, and approaches to landscape management. Moreover, a shift from a conservation-centred approach to a more holistic social-ecological system approach is evident. By leveraging on LG and TFCA strengths, cross-fertilization can foster meaningful cross-collaborations in managing different landscapes through dialogue, knowledge sharing, and identifying common goals, challenges and opportunities. © 2023, The Author(s).

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - Cultural ecosystem services constitute a field of research characterised by a growing number of publications from various academic disciplines. We carried out a systematic review of the literature that explicitly assessed with the valuation of cultural ecosystem services (CES). We used the review to identify, evaluate and interpret globally available research on the valuation of CES through the Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2005 to 2022. Thus, 349 articles were included in the analysis. The first article on valuation CES was published in 2010. We observed a temporal trend towards an increase in the number of articles between 2010 and 2022. The terrestrial environment and recreational value being the most emphasised among all the analysed articles. The countries in North America and Europe presented the highest numbers of studies on the theme. We observed associations between valuation methods and typologies of CES. The most studies focused on recreational and ecotourism typology with most of them associated with non-monetary methods for valuing cultural services. However, we did not observe an association between the valuation methods and the types of ecosystems investigated in the studies. We also found a temporal trend in the keywords, with clear differentiation in the theme of the studies from 2015 onwards. The most recent themes in the research area are associated with landscape, protected areas, perception, urban green space and social media studies. In conclusion, future research should focus on considering all CES categories for unequivocal descriptions of each category, proposing the development of typologies that may be applicable in various ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecological restoration after management of invasive alien plants
AU  - Singh, K.
AU  - Byun, C.
T2  - Ecological Engineering
AB  - The impacts of plant invasion on biodiversity are substantially visible and concerning. Despite the numerous studies conducted on the management of invasive alien plants (MIAPs), limited reviews are available on how to restore the lost diversity of native communities after the control of invasive alien plants. Here, through a systematic review we synthesize recent developments related to the restoration of native plant communities after MIAP and provide a checklist to make decisions for addressing various outstanding questions based on different contexts. We address (1) how the restoration of biodiversity after the MIAP could be improved by controlling reinvasion and novel invaders, and (2) what kind of follow up restoration methods should be employed to increase the diversity and functioning of native communities. Further, we briefly describe the importance of managing multitrophic interactions for reestablishing self-sustainable native plant communities after restoration. This review will guide researchers and restoration practitioners on how to move beyond the MIAP to conduct more research, and what actions to take for restoring the diversity of native communities on temporal and spatial scales. Based on the review of the state of knowledge, we offer the following practical implications: (1) given the investment of resources to curb invasive alien plants, active restoration efforts post invasion control are critical for effective recovery of biodiversity, regardless of the type of control method employed; (2) reducing the abundance of invasive seedbank, a robust legacy of invasion, and managing the arrival of new invasive seeds from the surroundings are crucial before the sowing or planting of native species; and (3) aiming to restore the desired diversity of native plant communities requires a thorough understanding of the conditions and level of assisted active restoration to implement the different practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The buzz around biodiversity decline: Detecting pollinator shifts using a systematic review
AU  - Whipple, S.
AU  - Bowser, G.
T2  - iScience
AB  - Climate and land use change are two of the largest drivers of worldwide biodiversity loss, but detecting drivers of insect decline is more complex. Online data sources can elucidate such responses while identifying systematic data gaps. Using a systematic review, we found 119 studies that document bumble bee and butterfly responses to climate change. While bee literature was limited, there is high confidence that species are emerging earlier (∼17 days), mismatching with floral resources (100% of studies), and changing range distributions (−25%). More butterfly literature was available but did not yield consistent responses. Evidence shows earlier emergences (∼5 days), decreasing range distributions (−19%), and population shifts amongst generalist (87% increase) versus specialist (65% decrease) groups. We argue that the effect of changing climates on floral emergence, abundance, and distribution may be more significant than the impact of climate change on biodiversity; however, further research is required, particularly within the Southern Hemisphere. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Using Plant Functional Traits to Inform Wetland Restoration
AU  - Sloey, T.M.

AU  - Kettenring, K.M.
T2  - Wetlands
AB  - Plant functional trait frameworks have been increasingly used to understand plant community dynamics, linkages between plants and ecosystem function, and have recently been applied to inform species selection for restoration of many ecosystem types. Yet, despite rapid development in this field over the past decade, the use of plant functional trait frameworks in the context of wetland restoration remains limited. Ambitious wetland restoration goals, and previous difficulties to meet them, underscore the need for continued refinement of science-backed restoration approaches for present and future conditions. Plant functional traits are one approach that deserves additional attention and scientific inquiry to inform restoration in wetlands. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (published 2000 to 2020) addressing plant functional traits in wetland restoration. Here, we summarize that body of literature and identify factors limiting the inclusion of plant functional trait frameworks in wetland restoration. We emphasize the need for consensus on terminology and trait selection in this field, provide definitive guidelines for moving this field forward for both researchers and practitioners, identify key plant functional traits to inform specific restoration goals, and highlight case studies exemplary of this approach in wetland restoration. A plant functional trait framework has the potential to inform and improve restoration of the world’s wetlands by making important linkages between traits, desired ecosystem functions, and restoration trajectories. However, the use of this approach requires further development and that both research and practice reach a consensus on which traits are most critical to measure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - Nature's contributions to people (NCP) rarely originate from nature alone. Often, only by joining natural capital with forms of anthropogenic capital, NCP emerge benefitting people. Understanding how NCP are co-produced by natural and anthropogenic capitals is needed to inform decision-making on sustainable land-use practices. Through a systematic review of the literature, we compile existing empirical evidence on NCP co-production and how this evidence was arrived at. We identified 237 observations from 25 publications on anthropogenic capital indicators co-producing NCP. The reviewed studies were conducted mainly in cropland and forest ecosystems and at the landscape level. Our results show that most evidence for co-production exists for material NCP, with physical capital and/or human capital as main input. Interestingly, non-material NCP relied mostly on human or social capital only, while material and regulating NCP involved multiple types of anthropogenic capital. Our findings provide guidance for future research on how to explicitly incorporate NCP co-production to analytically assess the relationships between anthropogenic capitals and NCP provision.

AB  - Climate change has an effect on ecosystems and people all around the globe and causes land degradation. A long-term decline in biological output, loss of ecological integrity, and a fall in the economic worth of the land are all signs of “land degradation”, a downbeat trend in land condition. In the red lateritic zone of the tropical area, where “climate change” and “land degradation” are related, they impact one another. On the other hand, due to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which slow the rate of carbon absorption, and the extent of various existing land degradation processes, which are worsened in pace and magnitude by “climate change”. The world's expanding population poses a challenge to supplying the rising demand for food in recent decades. The need for additional land for farming, feed, and other forms of production is fuelled by poverty and the destruction of the environment. In tropical regions, “soil erosion” caused by “water and wind, salinization and alkalinity, acidity, losses of organic carbon, nutrient imbalance, pollution/contamination by toxic substances, and soil sealing and capping” all call for immediate action to stop the land degradation process and sustainably restore productivity for environmental security and food security for the world's expanding population. After fulfilling the requirement systematic knowledge about soil, scientific use of natural resources (water, land, minerals, vegetation, air and biodiversity) will present a healthy planet with a healthy ecological system for future generations. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urbanization and climate change are endangering the sustainability of public spaces through increased land artificialization, ecological fragmentation, reduced resource availability, and limited accessibility to natural and seminatural areas. Properly managing Green Infrastructure (GI) can contribute to mitigating these challenges by delivering multiple provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural Ecosystem Services (ES). This would facilitate the implementation of strategically planned GI networks in cities for urban regeneration purposes. In this context, this study developed a systematic review on the ES provided by GI using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The analysis of 199 eligible articles indicated that more efforts should be made to address more ES at once, which connects to the need for conceiving GI as a strategically planned network of areas aimed at delivering diverse benefits. Based on the methods used in the items reviewed, geoprocessing tools and multi-criteria decision analysis are proposed to develop systems of indicators capable of accounting for multiple ES. These systems should also rely on multidisciplinary and participative procedures to encompass various facets of GI and represent the priorities of all relevant stakeholders. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The last decade has seen a profound increase in the development of assessment frameworks for ecosystem services, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NBS). This has improved understanding of NBS impact assessment, including processual aspects related to participatory planning and governance. We argue that, although representing a move in the right direction, NBS assessment frameworks would benefit from a broader framing of governance, including the role of government-led laws, policies and regulations along with community-led and collaborative multi-stakeholder initiatives. The consideration of marginalised communities and environmental justice should also be strengthened. To ensure a feasible and comprehensive approach to NBS governance assessment, we carried out a systematic literature review on the topic of urban NBS governance. Using thematic analysis, we developed a framework of five themes encompassing nine governance dimensions, of which some are further broken down into sub-dimensions. To assess the different NBS governance dimensions, we developed a tool in the format of a survey for urban decision-makers and other stakeholders, encompassing nine urban NBS governance indicators corresponding with the identified dimensions. Further to complementing NBS governance assessment approaches in important ways, we were able to highlight knowledge gaps around integrating features of the planning process and community-based or traditional knowledge. Our tool for monitoring urban NBS governance is simple to use and provides cities with a low-cost and comprehensive approach for monitoring and evaluating their readiness for mainstreaming NBS. © 2023

T2  - Land Use Policy
AB  - This paper conducts a systematic review of the literature (SRL) to update the relevance of social perception (SP) for managing protected areas and conservation spaces that contribute to global and regional efforts to conserve biological diversity and natural resources. Despite their importance, these areas often face complex and conflictive situations between the interest groups of the communities located within or adjacent to them. Therefore, and departing from an SRL, this paper aims to answer the main question about the sociodemographic elements that affect the SP related to protected areas. The results indicate that household income and education are linked to behaviors favoring conservation. Likewise, dissatisfaction regarding social well-being, access to natural resources and management generate behaviors that negatively affect the SP about the conservation role of protected areas. Managers must consider community participation to promote behaviors linked to compliance with regulations in favor of protected areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As primarily sessile organisms, plants often show a non-random spatial distribution of genotypes over distance. This process known as fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) has been suggested through systematic reviews to depend on life form, mating system, and pollen and seed dispersal vectors, while there is no consensus on its behaviour due to external factors, such as anthropogenic habitat changes. By conducting a systematic review and global meta-analysis of empirical FSGS studies, we aimed to evaluate how anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation influence the strength of FSGS in plant populations by means of the Sp statistic. Moreover, we tested how pollination and seed dispersal vectors contribute to the variation of the Sp statistic. We retrieved 243 FSGS studies from 1960 to 2020 of which only 65 were informative for the systematic review. Most empirical studies comprised outcrossers (84%) and trees (67%), with few herbs (23%) and scarce annual species (2%). In weighted meta-analyses for 116 plant populations (31 studies), we did not detect significant effects in the magnitude of effect sizes for the Sp statistic among undisturbed, degraded and fragmented habitats. Results showed significant effects for seed dispersal vectors, but not for pollination. Overall, we observed high variation among the effect sizes (not related to the goodness-of-fit of mixed models) of habitat status, pollination and seed dispersal categories, which precludes identifying biological trends on the Sp statistic. More empirical studies are needed that contrast multiple plant populations in disturbed versus undisturbed habitats, and by increasing the taxonomic groups, such as herbs and annual plants.  © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Influence of habitat alteration on the structure of helminth communities in small mammals: a systematic review and critical appraisal of theory and current evidence
AU  - Carrera-Játiva, P.D.
AU  - Acosta-Jamett, G.
T2  - Parasitology Research
AB  - Despite the extensive information on the effects of habitat alteration on the structure of helminth communities in small mammals, the evidence is still inconclusive. A systematic review was carried out using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guideline to compile and synthesize available literature on the influence of habitat alteration on the structure of helminth communities in small mammals. The aim of this review was to describe the variation in infection rates of helminth species associated with habitat alteration and to discuss the theoretical framework that may explain such changes in relation to parasite, host, and environmental features. Twenty-three scientific articles published between 2005 and 2022 were reviewed, 22 of which investigated parasite prevalence, 10 parasite burden, and 14 parasite richness in both altered and natural habitats. Information in assessed articles suggests that the structure of helminth communities in small mammals can be impacted by anthropogenic habitat alteration in various ways. Infection rates of monoxenous and heteroxenous helminths may increase or decrease in small mammals depending on whether their hosts (definitive and intermediate) are available, and environmental and host conditions modify the survival and transmission of parasitic forms. Also, given that habitat alteration may favor inter-species contacts, transmission rates of low host-specific helminths could be increased due to exposure to new reservoir hosts. In a continually changing world, it is essential to assess the spatio-temporal variations of helminth communities in wildlife inhabiting altered and natural habitats to determine potential impacts on wildlife conservation and public health. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Improvements in and the assessment of land use efficiency are crucial pillars for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study reviews 208 representative papers, oral reports, and project reports to provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the current status and future trends of research on land use efficiency assessment. The findings reveal that (1) the number of papers on land use efficiency assessment is rapidly increasing, with research primarily focused on environmental science and ecology (n = 157, 75.48%). (2) Quantitative models are gaining popularity for land use efficiency assessment, with more than 46.63% of the studies adopting the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. (3) The definition and analysis perspectives of land use efficiency are diverse, but research on relative land use efficiency and comprehensive analysis perspectives accounts for a significant proportion. (4) Constructing a large and complex model that incorporates geospatial effects, big data, and computer technology is a hot topic for future research methods. On the other hand, conducting land use efficiency research on a global scale is more conducive to achieving the SDGs. (5) The core to improving land use efficiency lies in the joint implementation of multi-pronged measures. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Grazing is one of the predominant human activities taking place today inside protected areas, with both direct and indirect effects on the vegetation community. The grassland vegetation diversity may enhance by the large herbivores as they are less selective in feeding impact on dominant plant species. Conservation of large herbivores is significant in the protected areas to maintain grassland vegetation. The study design and comprehensive literature were analyzed from 368 published literatures. A total of 13 articles were included, following the reporting standards for systematic evidence ssyntheses (RoSES) guidelines. Two independent reviewers carried out a systematic evaluation of the existing literature on The Wild Mega Grazers Maintain Vegetation Assemblage in Grassland and the threats. A total of 368 papers were identified, but after intensive screening only 13 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. From this review, the large herbivores were understood as an excellent group for the macro-ecological study. They occur in a diverse array of habitats, exhibit considerable morphological variation, have extensive distributions and shape ecosystem function through the effects of grazing. Grazing animals are considered a tool to maintain the biodiversity of grassland. However, the grazers are being threatened due to climate change issues, which raises concerns about their survival. The decreasing of forage grass species due to recurring floods have caused shrinking of habitat, spreading of invasive species, ultimately reducing the native palatable plants, such as Agropyron cristatum, Agrostis trini, Cleistogenes squarrosa, Elymus chinensis, Poa attenuata, Stipa krylovii as food items of the wild grazers. In addition, illegal grazing and cutting of grass are also challenging aspects which could have developed issues, such as grassland management. © 2023- Kalpana Corporation.

TI  - Carabid Beetles (Coleoptera) as Indicators of Sustainability in Agroecosystems: A Systematic Review
AU  - Makwela, M.M.

AU  - Munyai, T.C.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The sustainability of agroecosystems is at risk owing to continuous anthropogenic disturbance. As such, there is a need to evaluate indicator taxa that may be used to monitor the health of agricultural management systems. Carabid beetles are ubiquitous and functionally crucial in agroecosystems while at the same time are sensitive to the changes caused by management practices. Their quick response to anthropogenic disturbances has been proposed as a practical and realistic tool for monitoring the sustainability of agricultural practices. However, there is still disagreement about carabids as possible indicators of agroecosystem sustainability. We conducted a systematic review of the responses of carabid beetles to agricultural systems in different biogeographical areas. We examined whether these beetles could serve as potential indicators of agroecosystem sustainability. The ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus were used to search for papers published from 2000–2019. In total, we included 69 studies indicating the use of carabids to monitor the impact of management practices in agroecosystems. Most studies were conducted in European countries (n = 37), while Southern Africa and East Asia countries were significantly under-represented (n = 10). Carabid beetle response to agroecosystems varied between management practices, with biodiversity indices (n = 41: positive 60%, negative 19%, and neutral 19%) being the most measured response variable, followed by functional diversity (n = 28: positive 67%, negative 25%, and neutral 7%). Overall, our findings highlight the need for more research in underdeveloped countries, to investigate the potential of overlooked carabids and include response variables measuring functional diversity in assessing the sustainability of agricultural management. This will assist policy makers and land managers in making active and informed decisions about agroecological disturbances and management. © 2023 by the authors.

T2  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
AB  - Biodiversity underpins ecosystem functions that provide benefits to people, yet the role of rare and endangered species (RES) in supporting ecosystem services is unclear. Thus, it remains controversial whether arguments for conservation that focus on ecosystem services align with the protection of RES. We designed a systematic review protocol to critically assess the evidence for quantitative contributions of RES to terrestrial agricultural production, which is a key driver of biodiversity change and, simultaneously, could suffer from the loss of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Our review search criteria required that studies: 1) provide information on RES, 2) focus on an ecosystem service relevant for agriculture; and 3) include a quantitative measure of agricultural production. Surprisingly, we found only four studies that fulfilled these criteria, which was insufficient to perform a meta-analysis of results. Thus, we highlight here the gap in quantitative research, discuss the implications of this knowledge gap for the conservation of RES, and suggest future research directions. We conclude that further quantitative research is urgently needed to better inform conservation and agricultural policies, including research that focuses specifically on RES, incorporates more ecosystem services, and covers a wider range of climatic and socioeconomic contexts. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Curbing land degradation and mitigating climate change in mountainous regions: a systemic review
AU  - Vilakazi, B.S.

T2  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
AB  - Human population is envisaged to continue to grow, with a tremendous contribution to land degradation and climate change. Climate change and land degradation are intertwined, thus tackling climate change means mitigating land degradation. Climate change is a worldwide problem that affects lives and livelihoods; henceforth, mitigating measures are urgently required. With their unique, rich biodiversity, mountain areas are severely sensitive to climate change and land degradation; therefore, a speedy need to curb land degradation in mountain areas is needed. The aim of this systematic review was to appraise different strategic methods used globally to minimise land degradation and sustain mountainous areas in a frequently changing climate. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was utilised in this systematic review. The Scopus data base was utilised for document search, with a selection of articles limited between the years 2012 and 2021. Only articles written in English were considered. After assessing the abstracts, 703 articles were retained for a full review, leading to the final selection of 84 articles. The results show that soil erosion, overgrazing and construction of infrastructure are major causes of land degradation. The human population increase is also an enormous contributing factor to activities leading to land degradation and climate change. A conspicuous intensification of agricultural activities is expected to continue due to rising food demand. Curbing land degradation and climate change in mountain areas can be enforced by the government through stricter regulations. However, regulations and policies must be locally initiated, instead of globally initiated, with local communities being the main stakeholders. Hence, bottom-up rather than top-down policies would encourage local communities to embrace mitigation policy initiatives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Managed turfgrass is a common component of urban landscapes that is expanding under current land use trends. Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies globally, comprised mostly of C3 grass species in the U.S., including 24 chronosequence studies that evaluated carbon changes over 75 years or longer. We showed that turfgrass established within the last ten years had a positive mean soil C sequestration rate of 5.3 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 (95% CI = 3.7–6.2), which is higher than rates reported for several soil conservation practices. Areas converted to turfgrass from forests were an exception, sometimes lost soil carbon, and had a cross-study mean sequestration rate that did not differ from 0. In some locations, soil C accumulated linearly with turfgrass age over several decades, but the major trend was for soil C accumulation rates to decline through time, reaching a cross-study mean sequestration rate that was not different from 0 at 50 years. We show that fitting soil C timeseries with a mechanistically derived function rather than purely empirical functions did not alter these conclusions, nor did employing equivalent soil mass versus fixed-depth carbon stock accounting. We conducted a partial greenhouse gas budget that estimated emissions from mowing, N-fertilizer production, and soil N2O emissions. When N fertilizer was applied, average maintenance emissions offset 32% of C sequestration in recently established turfgrass. Potential emission removals by turfgrass can be maximized with reduced-input management. Management decisions that avoid losing accrued soil C—both when turfgrass is first established and when it is eventually replaced with other land-uses—will also help maximize turfgrass C sequestration potential. © 2022

AB  - Predicting which non-native species will negatively impact biodiversity is a longstanding research priority. The Functional Response (FR; resource use in relation to availability) is a classical ecological concept that has been increasingly applied to quantify, assess and compare ecological impacts of non-native species. Despite this recent growth, an overview of applications and knowledge gaps across relevant contexts is currently lacking. We conducted a systematic review using a combination of terms regarding FR and invasion science to synthesise scientific studies that apply the FR approach in the field and to suggest new areas where it could have valuable applications. Trends of publications using FR in invasion science and publications about FR in general were compared through the Activity Index. Data were extracted from papers to reveal temporal, bibliographic, and geographic trends, patterns in study attributes such as type of interaction and habitat investigated, taxonomic groups used, and context-dependencies assessed. In total, 120 papers were included in the review. We identified substantial unevenness in the reporting of FRs in invasion science, despite a rapidly growing number of studies. To date, research has been geographically skewed towards North America and Europe, as well as towards predator-prey interactions in freshwater habitats. Most studies have focused on a few species of invertebrates and fishes. Species origin, life stage, environmental temperature and habitat complexity were the most frequently considered context-dependencies. We conclude that while the FR approach has thus far been narrowly applied, it has broad potential application in invasion science and can be used to test major hypotheses in this research field. © Larissa Faria et al.

AU  - Canlas, I.P.

T2  - International Journal of Sustainable Development
AB  - This paper reports a systematic review of studies on pro-environmental behaviour anchored on the value-belief-norm theory of environmentalism extracted from the Scopus database and published between 1999 and the present. It aimed at determining the continuum of pro-environmental behaviour and study locale by examining context-themes of the same in the hope of determining research opportunities and future research directions. Results revealed that although the trend is increasing, the number of studies related to it still needs to grow. Among the categories of the context-themes that emerged include: 1) energy conservation; 2) green/sustainable consumption; 3) waste management; 4) green/sustainable tourism; 5) climate change mitigation and adaptation; 6) biodiversity conservation; 7) policy support; 8) pro-environmental behaviour in workplaces; 9) other minor emergent themes. Most locales were from western and highly developed countries. The later part of the paper reflects environmentalism in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

AB  - Global environmental changes are multifactorial and affected by multiple forms of land use. For this reason, and also in view of the current world climate scenario, they have become highly relevant and are subject to analysis and discussions on the best uses of land. The research presented here offers a systematic analysis on the priorities related to the multiple uses of land and their implications in urban planning. An exploratory and descriptive analysis is used with a qualitative approach based in a systematic literature review. General findings indicate that land uses arise amid the duality between economy and environmental concerns, while increasing frequencies of heat islands, desertification, suppression of green areas in cities, and other phenomena are the backdrop. Urban planning tied to social and environmental dynamics becomes a powerful engine to predict rational uses of the land, enabling and balancing the economic–environmental dynamics without overriding each other. Proper planning of urban land governs both the infrastructure itself and the human influence over space in addition to predicting future uses and disuse as well as actions not consistent with sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.

AU  - Tavera Martínez, L.

T2  - Environmental Research
AB  - Foraminifera are considered good bioindicators of environmental stress based on morphological abnormalities, but physiological responses occur far earlier and have not been evaluated as pollution markers. The aim of this review was to collate all published articles reporting physiological changes in foraminifera after environmental and anthropogenic stressors, to evaluate their reliability as early markers of environmental stress. We reviewed 70 studies, meeting the inclusion criteria, reporting 13 physiological effects classes after exposure to 17 different stressors. Immune functions, bleaching and lifecycle disruptions, were the most reported. Amphistegina and Ammonia showed high proportion of effects with lead and mercury, with a significant relationship between these heavy metals and the number of physiological effects classes in Ammonia, and between bleaching in Amphistegina gibbosa and Amphistegina lobifera with solar light and temperature. This suggests physiological responses are potentially reliable early indicators of environmental stress. It is necessary to increase quantitative physiological measures and standard exposure protocols in order to properly evaluate these organisms as pollution bioindicators. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Chicas, S.D.

T2  - Natural Hazards
AB  - In the last decades, natural fire regimes have experienced significant alterations in terms of intensity, frequency and severity in fire prone regions of the world. Modelling forest fire susceptibility has been essential in identifying areas of high risk to minimize threats to natural resources, biodiversity and life. There have been significant improvements in forest fire susceptibility modelling over the past two decades 2001–2021. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review of literature covering forest fire susceptibility modelling published during this period. The review provides insights on the main themes of forest fire susceptibility modelling research, the main base input factors used in models to map forest fire susceptibility, the main researchers, the areas where this type of research were implemented, technology and models used. It also highlights collaboration opportunities, and regions, such as Central America and Africa, where mapping of forest fire susceptibility is needed. We argue that such knowledge is crucial in order to identify critical factors and opportunities which can aid in improving factor selection and forest fire management. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Altering the natural flow regime, an essential component of healthy fluvial systems, through hydropower operations has the potential to negatively impact freshwater fish populations. Establishing improved management of flow regimes requires better understanding of how fish respond to altered flow components, such as flow magnitude. Based on the results of a recent systematic map on the impacts of flow regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity, evidence clusters on fish abundance and biomass responses were identified for full systematic review. The primary goal of this systematic review is to address one of those evidence clusters, with the following research question: how do changes in flow magnitude due to hydropower operations affect fish abundance and biomass? Methods: This review follows the guidelines of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. It examined commercially published and grey literature originally identified during the systematic map process and a systematic search update. All articles were screened using an a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text) and consistency checks were performed at all stages. All eligible articles were assessed for study validity and specifically designed data extraction and study validity tools were used. A narrative synthesis included all available evidence and meta-analysis using the standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) was conducted where appropriate. Review findings: A total of 133 studies from 103 articles were included in this systematic review for data extraction and critical appraisal. Most studies were from North America (60%) and were conducted at 146 different hydropower dams/facilities. Meta-analysis included 268 datasets from 58 studies, separated into three analyses based on replication type [temporal (within or between year replication) or spatial]. Fish abundance (226 datasets) and biomass (30 datasets) had variable responses to changes in flow magnitude with estimated overall mean effect sizes ranging from positive to negative and varying by study design and taxa. In studies with temporal replication, we found a detectable effect of alterations to the direction of flow magnitude, the presence of other flow components, sampling methods, season, and fish life stage. However, we found no detectable effect of these moderators for studies with spatial replication. Taxonomic analyses indicated variable responses to changes in flow magnitude and a bias towards salmonid species. Conclusions: This synthesis did not find consistent patterns in fish abundance or biomass responses to alterations or changes in flow magnitude. Fish responses to flow magnitude alterations or changes were highly variable and context dependent. Our synthesis suggests that biotic responses may not be generalizable across systems impacted by hydroelectric power production and operations, where specific features of the system may be highly influential. Site-specific and adaptive management may be necessary. To improve study validity and interpretability, studies with long-term continuous monitoring, and both temporal and spatial replication are needed. When this gold standard is unfeasible, studies should strive, at minimum, to maximize replication within both intervention and comparator groups for either temporal or spatial designs. To further address knowledge gaps, studies are needed that focus on non-salmonids, multiple seasons, and systems outside of North America. © 2022, The Author(s).

T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
AB  - Globally, the extent of inland wetlands has declined by approximately 70% since the start of the twentieth century, resulting in the loss of important wetland-associated ecosystem services. We evaluate the drivers of wetland values in agricultural landscapes to increase the effectiveness and reliability of benefit transfer tools to assign values to local wetland services. We reviewed 668 studies that analyzed wetland ecosystem services within agricultural environments and identified 45 studies across 22 countries that provided sufficient economic information to be included in a quantitative meta-analysis. We developed meta-regression models to represent provisioning and regulating wetland ecosystem services and identify the main drivers of these ecosystem service categories. Provisioning wetland ecosystem service values were best explained (direction of effects in parenthesis) by high-income variable (+), peer-reviewed journal publications (+), agricultural total factor productivity index (−) and population density (+), while agricultural total factor productivity index (−), income level (+) and wetland area (−) had significant effects on regulating wetland ecosystem service values. Our models can help estimate wetland values more reliably across similar regions because they have significantly lower transfer errors (66 and 185% absolute percentage error for the provisioning and regulating models, respectively) than the errors from unit value transfers. Model predicted wetland values ($/Ha/Year) range from $0.62 to $11,216 for regulating services and $0.95 to $2,122 for provisioning services and vary based on the differences in the levels of the variables (in the wetland locations) that best explained the estimated models. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The urban landscape is becoming the environment most familiar to most of humanity, which has consequences for society, the environment, and biodiversity. Here, we present a systematic review of current research integrating several areas of urban ecology to evaluate how plants are responding to urbanization. We found that most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The most represented biome was that of Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The majority of studies reported negative consequences of urbanization. The Urban Drivers most commonly cited as responsible for changes in plant species and communities were Land Cover Change and Biotic Invasion. In general, urbanization reduces the richness of plant species and pollinators' availability. It also homogenizes the environment, promotes the invasion of non-native species, causes changes in phenological events, and presents difficulties for plant growth. However, some species show evidence of adaptation to these adversities through their phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of traits that make individuals resilient to the urban environment. Although it has been established that urbanization imposes novel selective pressures resulting in unique adaptations to city life, patterns of changes in biodiversity in response to urbanization can vary by region, biomes, city history, and the taxa studied. The Urban Drivers responsible for floristic responses work simultaneously by modifying the environment. Therefore, it is challenging to predict response patterns of plants under urban growth. It is necessary to outline strategies for continuous monitoring to document the progress of species in perpetuating themselves in the face of urbanization. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - A Meta-analysis on the Effectiveness of Offsetting Strategies to Address Harm to Freshwater Fishes

T2  - Environmental Management
AB  - Offsetting aims to compensate for negative impacts due to authorized anthropogenic impacts associated with development. While anchored into legislation, residual or chronic impacts can occur after offset establishment. Advice and best practice on how to approach these impacts is rare. To address this, we reviewed 30 projects based on a systematic review and meta-analysis in freshwater ecosystems dealing with residual or long-term negative impacts to provide application advice for: habitat creation, habitat restoration, and biological and chemical manipulation. Project information was obtained through Boolean search terms and web-scraping. Habitat creation projects had a pooled effect size of 0.8 and offsetting ratios of 1:5 with high biomass increases of >140% compared to pre-establishment, associated with them. Habitat restoration projects targeted a wide range of species and communities with a pooled effect size of 0.66, offset ratios ranging from 1:1.2 to 1:4.6, and biomass increases generally > 100% compared to pre-restoration. Biological manipulation had the lowest effect size (0.51) with stocking being highly variable both in terms of biomass benefits and project outcomes pointing towards being mostly applicable in cases of direct fish harm not related to habitat aspects. We conclude that (1) all three assessed approaches have a potential application use for offsetting residual or chronic harm with approach-specific caveats. (2) Implementation costs differ across offset methods, with connectivity and side-channel projects having the lowest biomass gain per area costs (3) Time to first benefits required one to two years with time lags needing to be accounted for in the implementation and monitoring process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Mammal Review
AB  - The family Mustelidae is the largest among the order Carnivora. While we know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of information about many mustelids. We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as “the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon”. We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Groundwater is the main available freshwater resource and therefore its use, management and sustainability are closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and climate change are among the factors impacting groundwater recharge. The use of land-use and climate data in conjunction with hydrological models are valuable tools for assessing these impacts on river basins. This systematic review aimed at assessing the integrated modeling approach for evaluating hydrological processes and groundwater recharge based on LULC and climate change. The analysis is based on 200 peer-reviewed articles indexed in Scopus, and the Web of Science. Continuous research and the development of context-specific groundwater recharge models are essential to increase the long-term viability of water resources in any basin. The long-term impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on river basin interactions require integrating knowledge and modeling capabilities across biophysical responses, environmental problems, policies, economics, social, and data. © 2022

AB  - Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a “natural” forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.

AB  - Global change, population growth, and urbanization have been exerting a severe influence on the environment, including the social system and ecosystem. To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their rela-tionships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being. This study provides an enhanced understanding of the nexus among the three aspects and a reference for future studies to mitigate the relevant problems. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Sustainability of agricultural practices in Germany: a literature review along multiple environmental domains
AU  - Baaken, M.C.
T2  - Regional Environmental Change
AB  - Promoting and increasing the uptake of sustainable agricultural practices poses a major challenge for European agricultural policy. The scientific evidence for potentially relevant and environmentally beneficial practices, however, is scattered among numerous sources. This article examines the state of knowledge regarding agri-environmental practices and their impact on various domains of the environment (climate change, soil, water and biodiversity). The selection was restricted to practices applicable to German farmers. Ninety-eight literature reviews and meta-analyses assessing the environmental impacts of agri-environmental practices in the German context were found in a systematic review of the academic literature from 2011 onwards. A total of 144 agricultural management practices were identified that contribute toward achieving certain environmental objectives. The practices were clustered in eight categories: (1) Fertilizer strategies, (2) Cultivation, (3) Planting: vegetation, landscape elements & other, (4) Grazing strategies, (5) Feeding strategies, (6) Stable management, (7) Other, (8) Combined practices & bundles. The findings of this study suggest that some general patterns can be observed regarding the environmental benefits of different practices. While it is possible to derive recommendations for specific practices in terms of individual environmental objectives, their relevance is likely to be context-dependent. Moreover, this study reveals that bundles of practices can have positive synergistic impacts on the environment. Notably, only few reviews and meta-analyses considered the implementation and opportunity costs of environmentally beneficial practices. Agri-environmental policies need to consider the broad range of practices that have been shown to impact the environment positively, including their costs, and provide context-specific incentives for farmers to adopt them. © 2022, The Author(s).

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Restoring degraded and damaged salt marshes has become an important initiative in the coastal wetlands management around the world. Evaluating the economic output of salt marsh restoration is of great significance for identifying the current state of knowledge gaps related to conservation activities and economic benefits. To address this question, we conducted an overview of global salt marsh restoration projects, and their financial expenses and restoration benefits in the past 40 years. The results showed that most of the saltmarsh restoration projects are near megacities and larger rivers, and restoration techniques of different regions depend on the types of disturbance factors such as climate change, extreme weather events, and land use change. With limited resources, fund allocation between protected areas and unprotected areas in middle-income countries is often unbalanced, indicating a mismatch between conservation efforts and regional needs. Although restoration projects are expensive, the evidence in this article implies that most salt marsh restoration projects could recover their financial expense in the finite time, especially for large-scale restoration activities. Besides, the great carbon sequestration potential would make salt marsh restoration projects more profitable under current efforts to promote carbon sequestration for combating global warming.

AB  - Dams and other anthropogenic barriers have caused global ecological and hydrological upheaval in the blink of the geological eye. In the present article, we synthesize 307 studies in a systematic review of contemporary evolution following reduced connectivity and habitat alteration on freshwater fishes. Genetic diversity loss was more commonly observed for small populations impounded in small habitat patches for many generations behind low-passability barriers. Studies show that impoundments can cause rapid adaptive evolution in migration timing, behavior, life history, temperature tolerance, and morphology, as well as reduce phenotypic variance, which can alter adaptive potential and ecological roles. Fish passage structures can restore migratory populations but also create artificial selection pressures on body size and migration. The accelerating pace of dam removals and the paucity of data for fishes other than salmonids, other vertebrates, invertebrates, and tropical and southern hemisphere organisms highlights the urgent need for more studies on the rapid evolutionary effects of dams.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As an important domain of sustainability science, trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) is crucial for spatial planning to sustainably manage natural resources while satisfying the needs of local and non-local beneficiaries. However, there is still a growing debate in understanding, characterization, and visualization of the trade-off relationships. This paper systematically reviews a total of 473 articles, published in the last 16 years (2005–2020) through 135 academic journals, based on empirical studies conducted in over 80 countries, and led by the researcher from over 50 countries. Trade-off relationships are often visualized as spatial associations of ES, but very few articles have characterized trade-offs as the causal interaction among ES. More than two-thirds of the studies were carried out in temperate and sub-tropical regions, but we depicted an under-representation of the critical ecosystems in tropics. About 90% of the articles were based on funded research but the involvement of government institutions was very low (<10%). Trade-off analysis was based only on biophysical constraints of the ecosystem, as observed in more than 80% of the selected articles, without due regards of the divergence in utility functions of different stakeholders and ecosystem beneficiaries. This study identifies a total of 198 pairs of conflicting ES, of which the trade-off between crop production and carbon/climate services has the highest records of observation (i.e., as identified by 20% of the total studies). Further, this study identifies the major drivers (i.e., ecological and social) and stakeholders (i.e., land users and government agencies) of trade-off in ES, and major gaps in the analytical approach to understand the trade-off relationships. Based on our findings, we have discussed and recommended a number of research trajectories, including trans-disciplinary research considering both biophysical constraints and utility functions, in order to guide the future direction of sustainability science through the creation of win-win scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Safe drinking water’ supply is an essential service and depends directly on the water treatment that produces water treatment sludge (WTS) as a product, whose final destination varies and remains a challenge. The ecotoxicity assessment of the WTS address the ecological implications of the WTS disposal but these information is still scarce in the literature. In this sense, we did a systematic review of the ecotoxicological studies on WTS using databases from six platforms. From the 785 papers recovered; 16 studies were eligible and showed the ecotoxicity assays’ applicability to evaluate the WTS. We discussed WTS ecotoxicity considering sample characterization; terrestrial and aquatic toxicity assays; and WTS challenges. WTS proved to be a highly heterogeneous matrix composed mainly of coagulant precipitates, including Al and Fe. Studies lack consensus concerning the most representative/sensitive species for evaluating WTS’ toxicity. Crustaceans were the most studied aquatic group, although algae species were more sensitive. Besides, soil ecotoxicity assessed only plant growth, and a single study used the earthworm. Even papers used bioassays to indicate the recycling WTS’ feasibility, there is a lack of specific legislation regarding the WTS reuse. Furthermore, are necessary a regulation for WTS management that involves an ecological risk assessment. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T2  - Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia
AB  - Aim: Riparian zones are highly complex ecosystems, located on the banks of water bodies, with a fundamental role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). This study aimed to systematize the knowledge about studies on ES in riparian zones, emphasizing methodological aspects and pointing out gaps and opportunities to reinforce their importance. Methods: The study was carried out based on literature review data over a period of 21 years (2000-2020), using Scopus and Web of Science databases. In the first stage, aspects of bibliometrics were analyzed, as well as the countries that published the most on the subject. In the second stage, the methodological aspects were analyzed (with emphasis on the integrated analysis of multiple ES, which looked at the landscape, adopted multiscale or carried out economic valuation). Results: From 2000 to 2020, 6,969 publications were obtained from Scopus and 16,498 from Web of Science, applying the search terms riparian buffer or similar and 371 publications were obtained from Scopus and 1,512 from Web of Science applying ecosystem service and riparian zones or similar terms, with the USA being the country that most published about ES in riparian zones. From a total of 219 publications selected, the ES category most studied in riparian zones was Regulation (65%), followed by Support (16%), Provision (8%) and Cultural (2%). Publications that studied three or more ES corresponded to 9% of the analyzed publications. Approximately 10% of publications used methodological approaches with multiple ESs in an integrated way. Less than 10% of publications focused on economic valuation. Gaps and opportunities were identified concerning the relevance and methods for evaluating and valuing ESs in riparian zones. Conclusions: Few studies used methodological approaches integrating different ES. That calls attention to the need to carry out more studies that analyze ES in riparian zones using an integrated and multiscale approach because that is how the components of the ecosystem interact and provide joint responses that may assist in decision making. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Limnologia.

T2  - Society and Natural Resources
AB  - Ecological restoration is the process of repairing ecosystems that have been degraded by human activity. Because success depends upon the support of communities, engaging with the cultural values held by local people is critical to the restoration process. Cultural values are closely held beliefs about what is important to local communities, grounded in historical and contemporary cultural relationships with ecosystems. To address to what extent restoration projects in the peer-reviewed literature consider cultural values, we conducted a systematic review covering 1994–2021, resulting in a sample of 56 articles. From our review, we found that restoration projects include data on cultural values collected mostly through qualitative approaches. Concepts from cultural analysis, ecosystem services, and traditional ecological knowledge are commonly used to frame cultural values in restoration. Drawing on our results, we suggest a standardized process and set of best practices for practitioners and researchers incorporating cultural values into their restoration projects. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nature-based tourism, which includes visits to protected areas, is a growing trend. This may include consumptive and non-consumptive activities, with nature-based tourists being motivated to experience local culture and nature. Thus, tourism can contribute economically and socially to communities associated with protected areas, with the outcomes being both benefits and costs to local people. We carried out a systematic literature review to document and characterise the outcomes of nature-based tourism for people living in and around protected areas (terrestrial and inland waters). We evaluated 89 papers published from 1996 to 2020, most of which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The main benefits were employment, business opportunities and income, and the main costs were acculturation and abandonment of traditional lifestyle/practices, price inflation and conflict/crime. While most benefits were economic, most costs were socio-cultural. We found that benefits were most frequently experienced individually and costs experienced mostly at the collective or community levels. Inconsistencies in reporting of impacts suggests that future research should take a more consistent and systematic approach to evaluating benefits and costs of nature-based tourism from both the demographic and geographic perspectives, be more inclusive, and pay equal attention to objective and subjective measures of costs and benefits. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Agricultural land abandonment and its impacts on landscape features have been a, striking characteristic of many European rural areas over the last decades. Although, previous research identified drivers and environmental impacts of abandonment, few, described the post-agricultural abandonment trajectories. However, examining the, driving forces leading to different post-agricultural abandonment trajectories is key to, understand how alternative uses of these lands can be developed to address the, environmental, economic, and social challenges faced in these areas. This paper, reviews the literature of the different trajectories observed after agricultural, abandonment and the related drivers and processes. Based on the literature evidence, we proposed a novel categorisation of different abandonment trajectories, with their, drivers and landscape outcomes. In most reported cases, lands transitioned towards, semi-natural landscapes and few returned to different agricultural uses after, abandonment. The most common driving force of the landscape trajectory was the, absence of land management where secondary succession processes led to seminatural, landscapes. Quality and state of these landscapes were variable. Alternative, trajectories were essentially driven by institutional and socio-economic drivers within, biophysical constraints and opportunities for (re-)afforestation, re-farming, and multifunctional, uses of the land after abandonment. While abandoned lands can bring, opportunities to respond to biodiversity and other environmental policy goals, the, evidence across case studies suggests that adequate resources with institutional and, socio-economic incentives are required to stimulate favourable development, mitigate, potential trade-offs, and support land management. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - With the Convention on Biological Diversity conference (COP15), United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), and United Nations Food Systems Summit, 2021 is a pivotal year for transitioning towards sustainable food systems. Diversified farming systems are key to more sustainable food production. Here we present a global dataset documenting outcomes of diversified farming practices for biodiversity and yields compiled following best standards for systematic review of primary studies and specifically designed for use in meta-analysis. The dataset includes 4076 comparisons of biodiversity outcomes and 1214 of yield in diversified farming systems compared to one of two reference systems. It contains evidence from 48 countries of effects on species from 33 taxonomic orders (spanning insects, plants, birds, mammals, eukaryotes, annelids, fungi, and bacteria) of diversified farming systems producing annual or perennial crops across 12 commodity groups. The dataset presented provides a resource for researchers and practitioners to easily access information on where diversified farming systems effectively contribute to biodiversity and food production outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) installations are increasing globally. However, their interaction with the hosting water body and implications for ecosystem function is poorly understood. Understanding potential impacts is critical as water bodies provide many ecosystem services on which humans rely and are integral for delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we used scientific evidence from a systematic review and stakeholder expertise, captured through an international survey and a workshop, alongside existing understanding of the role of water bodies in delivering ecosystem services and the SDGs. We found 22 evidence outcomes that indicated potential physical, chemical and biological impacts of FPV on water bodies. Assessment by stakeholders from across sectors indicated that reduced water evaporation is the greatest opportunity, whilst changes to water chemistry, including nitrification and deoxygenation, are the greatest threat. Despite these findings, FPV operators reported no observed water quality or ecosystem impacts. However, only 15% of respondents had performed water quality analysis; visual inspection alone cannot ascertain all water quality impacts. Based on the integration of these findings, we determined that FPV could impact nine ecosystem services. Furthermore, established linkages between ecosystem services and SDGs indicate the potential for impacts on eight SDGs, although whether the impact is positive or negative is likely to depend on FPV design and water body type. Our results further the understanding of the effects of FPVs on host water bodies and may help to ensure the anticipated growth in FPVs minimises threats and maximises opportunities, safeguarding overall sustainability. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Major global initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have overlooked the prospects of the river ecosystem in achieving SDGs (e.g., SDGs 6, 14), despite the substantial role of the river in human civilisation, and the contribution of river restoration to ecological improvement. Realising the role of river social-ecological systems in providing ecosystem services (ES) to society, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to identify progress, gaps and future research directions for river restoration research across the globe. We systematically reviewed articles and summarised the trends of river restoration within the explicit context of ES assessment. The economic and ecological aspects of river restoration were the prime focus of major studies, whereas social benefits have been least addressed. The results identified the research gaps and future opportunities and tried to supplement those gaps by addressing the questions that need to be researched in future studies. The proposed conceptual framework is designed how application of ES perspective help to integrate social benefits in river restoration research. If we are to achieve sustainable management of water, food production and zero hunger goals, overcoming the identified conceptual and methodological gaps and conceptualising the river as a social-ecological system is necessary for future river restoration research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystem services (ES) are vulnerable to land use and land cover changes (LULCC). These changes are triggered by different drivers of change (e.g., economic, social, political, environmental - climate change). Understanding the potential future LULCC is an effective way to anticipate the impacts on ES supply. In recent years, some researchers applied different spatial modelling methods to assess the potential LULCC future impacts on ES supply, but so far, no systematic review was carried out. This work aims to do a bibliographic review about future LULCC and their implications on ES supply (provisioning, regulating, and cultural services). After a rigorous bibliographic review, we identified 957 papers. However, only 79 papers meet the criteria to be used in the review. The results showed that (i) the studies have been mainly focused on Asia (55.70%) and Europe (17,72%); (ii) the most common and extensively used models to project future LULCC were cellular automata (30.86%), CLUE-S model (8.64%) and Land Change Modeler (8.64%); and (iii) the most used methods to assess future impacts on ES were the InVEST model (24.04%), and equations used in previous works (12.5%). These studies were mainly focused on measuring future impacts on provisioning (44.11%) and regulating services (43.59%). Also, most of the works lack external validation. The diversity of studies evaluated allowed to recognise gaps and outline insights into the current scientific research on this scientific domain, representing an essential contribution to the current state of knowledge by supporting both practitioners and scientists. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human attitudes and behaviours have been linked to the degradation of global biodiversity, particularly forest ecosystems. Indeed, effective conservation actions require that the attitudes and behaviours of affected individuals and communities are taken into account. While several studies have examined how human attitudes and behaviours affect conservation, it is still unclear which, and how, human value orientations influence conservation attitudes and behaviour. This is critical because attitudes and behaviours are underpinned by the complex concept of human values. Thus, effective management and conservation of environmental resources requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of these values, and how they affect attitudinal and behavioural preferences towards the natural environment and their protection. Here we review the human value orientations influencing people's attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation, and discuss how conservation projects can be more successful by aligning their goals and operations to people's values. To do this, we carried out a scoping review, using the sub-Saharan Africa region as a case study, and followed the PRISMA-ScR systematic review guidelines. A narrative synthesis was adopted for data analysis. We identified different value types that fall within three broad human value orientation domains influencing forest conservation attitudes and behaviours. Anthropocentric and relational value orientations emerged as most dominant, with both positive and negative influences on a number of forest conservation attitudes and behaviours, albeit with more evidence for positive influence. The positive attitudes and behaviours were linked to utilitarian motivations and cultural beliefs and include rural support for conservation, compliance to forest rules, sustainable forest use, and participation in forest management. The values linked to dependence on forest resources, low benefits from conservation, and conservation costs, tend to trigger negative conservation attitudes and behaviours. To effectively achieve forest conservation goals, environmental managers, conservationists, and decision-makers should understand the extent and directional influence of value orientations on conservation attitudes and behaviours. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - To ensure and maintain ecosystem service delivery in cities undergoing densification, strategic tree planting is important. The effects of tree location on ecosystem service delivery have been emphasised. However, there is no integrated overview of the different aspects of tree location, here called spatial contextual factors, that mediate urban tree ecosystem services. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and provides a comprehensive overview of spatial contextual factors recognised by research as relevant for ecosystem service delivery by urban trees. To support creating such an overview, we first gain insight into the current common understanding of what spatial context is conceptually and how it participates in the co-production of ecosystem services. We find that generally, spatial context is represented by both social and ecological structures and processes and that it mediates ecosystem services by four mechanisms along the ecosystem service cascade. In the next step, we identify 114 unique spatial contextual factors mediating 31 ecosystem services of urban trees. Of all factors, people, represented by physical location, socio-demographics or building functions, mediate the highest number of services, highlighting the importance of urban planning and design in mediating urban tree ecosystem services. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The expansion of urban areas worldwide is increasing the anthropogenic impact upon soil and highlights the important role of urban areas in supporting a sustainable future. As such, urban soils are becoming more important in the delivery of a broad range of ecosystem services (ESs), including carbon storage and climate regulation, biomass provision for food and water flow regulation, and recreational benefits. In this review, we aim to support the development of this emerging research area and, subsequently, support the improved treatment and management of urban soil and ES delivery. We present a systematic review of which ESs have been studied and examine trends in research using a co-occurrence analysis of key terms. We then provide a summary review of current knowledge on ESs and identify the gaps in knowledge. Our review highlights that this is a young, but growing, field of research, with a marked increase in publications since 2014. We found that supporting processes and regulating services were most commonly studied, with 88% and 71% of the papers relating to quantitative studies addressing these, respectively. Cultural, provisioning and water-related ESs were relatively understudied, suggesting key gaps for future research. However, this may be attributable to a disconnection between academic communities rather than a lack of knowledge. Fewer than 20% of quantitative studies addressed more than two ESs simultaneously, leading us to suggest that urban soil multifunctionality is a key area for future research, and highlighting the need to integrate understanding of urban soil ESs across disciplines and professions. In addition to this overarching suggestion, we propose six research gaps and opportunities: further research into biomass provision for food, water-related ESs and cultural ESs; greater geographical representation; further interconnection between research and practitioner communities; and a focus on the future drivers of soil change in urban environments. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Trends and knowledge gaps in field research investigating effects of anthropogenic noise
AU  - Jerem, P.
AU  - Mathews, F.
T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Anthropogenic noise is a globally widespread sensory pollutant, recognized as having potentially adverse effects on function, demography, and physiology in wild animals. Human population growth and associated changes in urbanization, transportation, and resource extraction all contribute to anthropogenic noise and are predicted to increase in the coming decades. Wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise is expected to rise correspondingly. Data collected through field research are uniquely important in advancing understanding of the real-world repercussions of human activity on wildlife. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of literature published from 2008 to 2018 that reported on field investigations of anthropogenic noise impacts. We evaluated publication metrics (e.g., publication rates and journal type), geographical distribution of studies, study subject, and methods used. Research activity increased markedly over the assessment period. However, there was a pronounced geographical bias in research, with most being conducted in North America or Europe, and a notable focus on terrestrial environments. Fewer than one-fifth of terrestrial studies were located in rural areas likely to experience urbanization by 2030, meaning data on ecosystems most likely to be affected by future changes are not being gathered. There was also bias in the taxonomic groups investigated. Most research was conducted on birds and aquatic mammals, whereas terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates received limited attention. Almost all terrestrial studies examined diurnal species, despite evidence that nocturnality is the prevailing animal activity pattern. Nearly half the studies investigated effects of road or urban noise; the bulk of research was restricted to functional, rather than physiological or demographic consequences. Few experimental studies addressed repercussions of long-term exposure to anthropogenic noise or long-term postexposure effects, and multiple noise types or levels were rarely compared. Tackling these knowledge gaps will be vital for successful management of the effects of increasing wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise. © 2020 The Authors.

T2  - Journal of Land Use Science
AB  - The growing demand for food, water, and shelter change the way people use land. These changes have affected or even caused conflict in several locations. However, conflicts do not erupt in isolation; they are the result of multiple interacting causes. There is limited structural understanding of these causes. In this study, we systematically coded case studies that report on conflict related to land-use change, including deforestation in commodity frontiers, agricultural development on common land, and urban development. Based on an analysis of 62 cases, we identified population growth, overlapping land rights, ethnic fragmentation, and economic inequality as the most frequently reported root causes, while rises in land prices was the most often reported proximate cause. Reported institutional causes suggest that the problem is not necessarily the complete absence of governance mechanisms, but rather that governance mechanisms are not fully equipped to deal with the complexities of the observed land-use changes. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture have led to global declines in biodiversity. This paper presents a systematic review protocol to clarify under what management and landscape contexts diversified farming practices are effective at improving outcomes for terrestrial biodiversity, and potential trade-offs or synergies with agricultural yields. The systematic review will be developed following the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). The review will include articles that compare levels of diversity (e.g., abundance, richness, Shannon’s diversity index) of any terrestrial taxon (e.g., arthropods, mammals) in diversified farming systems to levels in simplified farming systems and/or natural habitats, prioritising articles that also report agricultural yields. We will search for relevant peer-reviewed primary studies in two global repositories: Scopus and Web of Science, and among primary studies included in previous meta-analyses that are retrieved from the search. Full-texts of identified articles will be screened using a clear inclusion/exclusion eli-gibility criteria. All included articles will be assessed to determine their internal validity. A narrative synthesis will be performed to summarize, describe and present the results, and where the articles provide sufficient and appropriate data, we will conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

T2  - Frontiers in Plant Science
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the major threats to global and local biodiversity. In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management. We expect that this review will provide direction for invasive plant species research and management aimed at protecting biodiversity in European temperate forest ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Langmaier and Lapin.

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - Environmental degradation is increasing globally through direct anthropogenic interventions, such as urbanisation and unsustainable land use, and human-induced drivers, such as climate change. A result is the loss of ecosystem services. The way humans benefit from diverse ecosystem services for their physical and mental wellbeing differs from place to place and between communities and social groups. While the existing research on ecosystem services is rich on the relevance of provisioning ecosystem services for human wellbeing, the role of cultural ecosystem services is not sufficiently understood. Moreover, a variety of methods and a wide range of approaches are adopted to study how landscapes provide ecosystem services and how important they are for different people. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews where and how cultural ecosystem services are studied explicitly with respect to aspects of human physical and mental wellbeing and various social groups. Our review provides an overview of research biases and gaps that need to be addressed to advance our understanding of this link, which is critical to implementing meaningful environmental conservation and protection for local communities and vulnerable populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Land
AB  - The need to recognize diverse actors, their knowledge and values is being widely promoted as critical for sustainability in contemporary land use, natural resource management and conservation initiatives. However, in much of the case study literature, the value of including indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in the management and governance of landscapes tends to be overlooked and undervalued. Understanding ILK as comprising indigenous, local and traditional knowledge, this systematic review synthesizes how ILK has been viewed and incorporated into landscape-based studies; what processes, mechanisms and areas of focus have been used to integrate it; and the challenges and opportunities that arise in doing so. Queries from bibliographic databases (Web of Science, JSTOR, Scopus and Africa Wide) were employed. Findings from the review underscore that the literature and case studies that link landscapes and ILK are dominated by a focus on agricultural systems, followed by social-ecological systems, indigenous governance, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation and climate change studies, especially those related to early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. The growing importance of multi-stakeholder collaborations in local landscape research and the promotion of inclusive consultations have helped to bring ILK to the fore in the knowledge development process. This, in turn, has helped to support improved landscape management, governance and planning for more resilient landscapes. However, more research is needed to explore ways to more effectively link ILK and scientific knowledge in landscape studies, particularly in the co-management of these social-ecological systems. More studies that confirm the usefulness of ILK, recognize multiple landscape values and their interaction with structures and policies dealing with landscape management and conservation are necessary for enhanced sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Mountain ecosystem services (MES) can provide a wide range of benefits for human well-being, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. This systematic review work analyzed existed knowledge and research gaps on MES at the global level. The study used databases of science direct, Scopus and google scholar using searching, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) framework. Using specific keywords for the searching engine, the number of publications linked with MES were about 1252 which published between 1992 and June 2019. But, only 74 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The analysis highlighted the existence of gaps in the literature including case studies from a limited geographical areas, focus on regulating and provisioning services, and lack of studies that explore the kinds of interlink between ecosystem services, and occurrence of limitation linked with data and methodology. From the 74 publications used for analysis, only seven of them were addressed mainly trade-offs and synergies, but most of them focus on quantification, qualification and economic valuation of the services. From the total case studies, the services addressed were summed up to 317 services, and the services such as climate regulation, food and fodder, fresh water, recreation and ecotourism, and erosion regulation studied more. On the contrary, photosynthesis, ornamental resources, net primary production, disease regulation, genetic resources, water purification and waste treatments were the least studied. Therefore, future research works should focus on mountainous areas of no and least studied of its ecosystem services. Critical studies are also required that indicate the link between a human being with MES, the trade-offs and synergies between MES and the influence of human beings on the quality and accessibility of ecosystem services. Besides, priority should be given by researches for methodological development and proposing management option for the mountain ecosystem and resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Global Change Biology
AB  - Estuaries are productive ecosystems providing important habitat for a diversity of species, yet they also experience intense levels of anthropogenic development. To inform decision-making, it is essential to understand the pathways of impacts of particular human activities, especially those that affect species such as salmon, which have high ecological, social-cultural and economic values. Salmon systems provide an opportunity to build from the substantial body of research on responses to estuary developments and take stock of what is known. We conducted a systematic English-language literature review on the responses of juvenile salmon to anthropogenic activities in estuaries and nearshore areas asking: what has been studied, where are the major knowledge gaps and how do stressors affect salmon? We found a substantial body of research (n = 167 studies; 1,369 comparative tests) to help understand responses of juvenile salmon to 24 activities and their 14 stressors. Across studies, 82% of the research was conducted in the eastern Pacific (Oregon and Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada) showing a limited geographical scope. Using a semiquantitative approach to summarize the literature, including a weight-of-evidence metric, we found a range of results from low to moderate–high confidence in the consequences of the stressors. For example, we found moderate–high confidence in the negative impacts of pollutants and sea lice and moderate confidence in negative impacts from connectivity loss and changes in flow. Our results suggest that overall, multiple anthropogenic activities cause negative impacts across ecological scales. However, our results also reveal knowledge gaps resulting from minimal research on particular species (e.g. sockeye salmon), regions (e.g. Atlantic) or stressors (e.g. entrainment) that would be expedient areas for future research. With estuaries acting as a nexus of biological and societal importance and hotspots of ongoing development, the insights gained here can contribute to informed decision-making. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - 1. Conflict between humans and large carnivores hinders carnivore conservation worldwide. Livestock depredations by large carnivores is the main cause of conflict, triggering poaching and retaliatory killings by humans. Resolving this conflict requires an understanding of the factors that cause large carnivores to select livestock over wild prey. Individual studies to date report contradictory results about whether wild prey density affects livestock depredation by large carnivores. 2. We carried out a systematic review of grey wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences. We reviewed and analysed 119 grey wolf dietary studies from 27 countries to determine whether wild prey or livestock density affects grey wolf dietary selection. 3. We also assessed whether there are traits that predispose species to be preyed upon (body size, group size, defence mechanisms, speed), and whether livestock management is a factor that affects selection of livestock by grey wolves. 4. Overall, wild prey (65% of the total frequency of occurrence in all reviewed grey wolf diet studies) was selected for even when livestock was abundant. The average proportion of biomass percentage in grey wolf diets was 13% for livestock and 19% for wild species. 5. Wild prey species in possession of defence mechanisms (horns, antlers, spikes, and fangs), with high body weight and present in high density were more likely to be depredated by grey wolves. 6. Even when prey abundance significantly affected selection of wild prey, livestock predation was much lower considering their substantially higher density. Areas where livestock were left to graze freely in small numbers (<20 individuals/km2) were more vulnerable to grey wolf attacks. 7. Our results suggest that the adoption of attack prevention measures on pastures and the increase of wild prey abundance could reduce depredation on livestock by grey wolves, and in turn, provide better opportunities for coexistence between humans, grey wolves and livestock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The fundamental change in nocturnal landscapes due to the increasing use of artificial light at night (ALAN) is recognized as being detrimental to the environment and raises important regulatory questions as to whether and how it should be regulated based on the manifold risks to the environment. Here, we present the results of an analysis of the current legal obligations on ALAN in context with a systematic review of adverse effects. The legal analysis includes the relevant aspects of European and German environmental law, specifically nature conservation and immission control. The review represents the results of 303 studies indicating significant disturbances of organisms and landscapes. We discuss the conditions for prohibitions by environmental laws and whether protection gaps persist and, hence, whether specific legislation for light pollution is necessary. While protection is predominantly provided for species with special protection status that reveal avoidance behavior of artificially lit landscapes and associated habitat loss, adverse effects on species and landscapes without special protection status are often unaddressed by existing regulations. Legislative shortcomings are caused by difficulties in proving adverse effect on the population level, detecting lighting malpractice, and applying the law to ALAN-related situations. Measures to reduce ALAN-induced environmental impacts are highlighted. We discuss whether an obligation to implement such measures is favorable for environmental protection and how regulations can be implemented. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Intensification of the dairy industry globally, combined with a changing climate, has placed increased pressure on natural capital assets (and the flow of ecosystem services) on farms. Agroforestry is widely promoted as an intervention to address these issues. While some benefits of integrating trees on farms, such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity, are reasonably well known, less is known about other potential benefits, such as on-farm production. Understanding and quantifying these benefits would inform farm planning and decision-making. We used a systematic review approach to analyse the evidence base for biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems (including shelterbelts, riparian plantings, plantations, pasture trees, silvopasture and remnant native vegetation) provided to grazed dairy enterprises. We identified 83 publications containing 123 records that fit our review criteria of reporting on biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems on dairy farms relative to a grazed pasture comparison. For each relationship between a woody system and ecosystem service, we assessed the level of support, strength and predominant direction of evidence, and summarised the causal relationships (woody system ≫ mechanism ≫ outcome). Shelterbelts and riparian plantings were the most commonly reported woody systems. Linkages between woody systems and ecosystem services were largely positive, with the types of services provided and their importance differing among systems. Mean evaluation scores for the strength of the evidence were moderate to strong. However, the number of records for each relationship was often low. Consequently, only eight of the 30 causal pathways identified had high confidence; a further 14 had medium confidence indicating that these have good potential to deliver benefits but warrant further work. Although the evidence here was largely qualitative, our results provide strong support for the internal benefits that natural capital assets, such as on-farm woody systems, can provide to the productivity and resilience of grazed dairy enterprises. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable management of coastal and inland water areas requires knowledge of how tourism and recreation affects the ecosystems. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify to what extent recreational boat traffic and infrastructure for mooring affect the abundance of submerged vegetation on soft bottoms. Our systematic search yielded 25 studies containing data on effects of boat traffic, docks and mooring buoys on vegetation abundance. The abundance below docks was on average 18% of that in controls, and areas with boat traffic had on average 42% of the abundance in control areas. Mooring buoys often created scour areas without vegetation. However, the effects were variable and there were too few studies to test the reasons for this variability. We conclude that boating can cause significant declines in submerged vegetation but that informed management of boat traffic and improved design of docks and buoys can reduce negative impacts. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Ecological intensification of agriculture (EIA) aims to assure food security by harnessing ecosystem services while minimizing external inputs and environmental harms. One manifestation of EIA proposed worldwide is agroecological farming, which will affect future landscapes, biodiversity and make assurance of crop yields more reliant on management of natural pest control. Using a systematic review we examined available knowledge to forecast the consequences for natural pest control of a landscape-scale transition to agroecological farming. A large body of information showed that prevailing agroecological practices can enhance natural pest control at the field level. This was, however, highly context specific (organisms, crop types or regions) and often modulated by landscape complexity, albeit in an inconsistent way. Consequently, our generic understanding of the functional responses of natural pest control to agroecological management remains limited. Furthermore, the consequences of a landscape-scale expansion of agroecological farming for natural pest control was hardly documented, with results suggesting limited effects. Available modelling tools and approaches to forecast natural pest control were diverse and promising, but the integration of accurate descriptions of farming practices at the landscape scale remains a challenge. Few studies integrated socio-economic aspects and we present some approaches to guide and co-design the transition to future agroecological landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Teixeira, C.P.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - Context: Anthropogenic changes (e.g., climate change, land-use change, species introductions, etc.) are reshaping ecosystems processes and patterns and causing an intense reorganization of the Earth's biotic systems. As a result, unprecedented combinations of species are emerging, forming “novel ecosystems”. Objectives: The goals of this work are: (1) to examine the history and relevance of the novel ecosystems concept in non-urban and urban contexts, and (2) to evaluate what has been the focus of the research about the novel ecosystems concept in non-urban and urban contexts. Methods: Through an extensive systematic review, we collected 548 records published between 1997 and 2018. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria the final database comprised 255 relevant records that were further examined and classified according to the scope of this review. Results: Our results demonstrated that research referring to the novel ecosystems concept has been mainly focused on non-urban areas. Still, there is a growing interest in exploring this concept in the urban domain. The definition and criteria used to describe novel ecosystems have been transforming over the years. Research has been mainly targeted on multiple taxonomic groups and plants, on terrestrial ecosystems, and conducted in North America. Overall, restoration ecology, conservation, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and climate change have been the most discussed topics in the novel ecosystems’ literature. Conclusions: Our review confirms that the application of the novel ecosystems concept to urban areas is pertinent and auspicious. Future research should seek to understand the limits and differences of novel ecosystems in non-urban and urban contexts. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Bees and the pollination services they deliver are beneficial to both food crop production, and for reproduction of many wild plant species. Bee decline has stimulated widespread interest in assessing hazards and risks to bees from the environment in which they live. While there is increasing knowledge on how the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in agricultural systems may impact bees, little is known about effects of other pesticides (or plant protection products; PPPs) such as herbicides and fungicides, which are used more widely than insecticides at a global scale. We adopted a systematic approach to review existing research on the potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, with the aim of identifying research approaches and determining knowledge gaps. While acknowledging that herbicide use can affect forage availability for bees, this review focussed on the potential impacts these compounds could have directly on bees themselves. We found that most studies have been carried out in Europe and the USA, and investigated effects on honeybees. Furthermore, certain effects, such as those on mortality, are well represented in the literature in comparison to others, such as sub-lethal effects. More studies have been carried out in the lab than in the field, and the impacts of oral exposure to herbicides and fungicides have been investigated more frequently than contact exposure. We suggest a number of areas for further research to improve the knowledge base on potential effects. This will allow better assessment of risks to bees from herbicides and fungicides, which is important to inform future management decisions around the sustainable use of PPPs. © 2019 Cullen et al.

TI  - Catchment-scale cumulative impact of human activities on river channels in the late Anthropocene: implications, limitations, prospect
AU  - Downs, P.W.
AU  - Piégay, H.
T2  - Geomorphology
AB  - Evidence for the proposed Anthropocene epoch in fluvial geomorphology hinges on the influence of human activities relative to natural forcing. However, research on cause-effect understanding in river channel evolution has rarely focused on the cumulative impact of multiple drivers for change, limiting insights. Systematic review of 25 recent studies professing to explain reach-scale channel responses to cumulative impacts of human activities and natural forcing over the recent past (ca. 1880–2005)reveals some consistencies in spatio-temporal response across various catchment sizes (median 3000 km2)in mostly industrialized nations. Common drivers for change include changing flood and flow regimes, dam construction, changing land uses and forest cover, bank protection and instream aggregate mining. Recent channel evolution has predominantly involved narrowing, incision and terrace development, reduced bed sediment storage, lower activity rates and simplified channel geometries. Rates of channel change frequently peaked 1955–1990, providing some support for the Anthropocene ‘Great Acceleration’. Evidence here suggests that many river systems are now in morphologically-novel configurations, coinciding temporally with dramatic recent declines in global freshwater aquatic biodiversity. Sustainable approaches to freshwater management must acknowledge these configurations, placing emphasis on process-based approaches to river ecosystem health in which sediment cascades are reconceived to reflect altered longitudinal and lateral connectivity. However, the reviewed studies are driven largely by expert judgment, depicting cause-effect associations through summary conceptual models based on spatial proximity and temporal synchronicity, providing insufficient scientific proof for the Anthropocene based on the ‘overwhelming’ impact of human factors. More conclusive cause-effect statements will require hypothetic-deductive approaches, explicit functional criteria and best-practice environmental model building. Geomorphologists should now move beyond the ‘phase of discovery’ and develop rigorous proofs for cause-effect relationships of cumulative impact; this may be enhanced by developing an avowedly ‘Anthropocene’ perspective in which rivers are viewed critically as socio-biophysical systems co-evolving with human activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A wider view of assessments of ecosystem services in coastal areas: the perspective of social-ecological complexity
AU  - Solé, L.
AU  - Ariza, E.
T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - Through complex interactions and feedback processes between coastal ecological and social components at different temporal and spatial scales, coastal environments coproduce a range of ecosystem services (ES) and benefit different social groups. In these highly populated areas, multiple actors, interests, and activities coexist, leading to intensified conflicts between stakeholders. The research presented here aims to understand how coastal social-ecological complexity is studied within coastal ES literature. A systematic review of the literature consisting of 199 manuscripts was performed using the PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The results show that coastal ES research has been focused on understanding ecological processes for ES provision and value. Hence, coastal ES studies fall short of considering the social components and social-ecological interactions of coastal systems: ES flows, demand, coproduction, power relations, institutions and governance, temporal and spatial scales, value pluralism, uncertainty, and human well-being multidimensions and distribution. The partial integration of social-ecological complexity within coastal ES research limits coastal ES management because nonlinear interactions among social and ecological components are not well understood, particularly stakeholders’ relations, their roles, and the links to ES. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates the gaps identified during the review. The framework places coproduction and power relations as the core factors of assessments of coastal ES, as means to understand complex, nonlinear social-ecological interactions and feedback processes. Hence, it also provides necessary tools to address normative issues of coastal management such as control, access, trade-offs, and benefits. © 2019 by the author(s).

AB  - Modeling of fish population developments in the context of hydropower impacts and restoration planning requires autecological information on critical life stages (especially on juvenile stages and reproduction). We compiled and examined the current data availability in peer-reviewed and grey literature on autecological requirements of ten rheophilic fish species at risk, belonging to the salmonid, cyprinid, and cottid families. In total, 1725 data points from 223 sources were included. Economically important salmonids and the common nase were the most studied species. Grey and peer-reviewed data showed similar dispersion and variance and contributed nearly equally to the data pool of the specific species. An in-depth analysis on seven ecological parameters revealed no significant differences between both sources in terms of data availability and quality. We found substantial deficits in the data for about a quarter of the reviewed ecological parameters, in particular on individual densities in the habitats, egg development and information about juvenile stages despite the necessity of such data for more advanced population analyses. To secure fish populations in the long term, more data on basic autecological parameters is needed and grey literature might add valuable information, particularly if it relies on standardized methodologies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of 502 articles, published between 2000 and 2016, to characterize the research on human-carnivore relations according to (i) temporal and geographical distribution, (ii) biology, (iii) relations between carnivores and humans, (iv) social actors, (v) drivers of change, (vi) management, and (vii) applied methods. We performed a detrended correspondence analysis and Kruskal-Wallis tests to identify and describe thematic clusters used in human-carnivore relations research. Our results show that research is deeply biased so far, and four important knowledge gaps were detected. First, we found more studies had been conducted in the Global North than in the Global South, although risks and benefits of living alongside carnivores exist in the Global South equally. Second, most research focused on large predators, while small and medium-sized carnivores are also source of damages and ecosystem services. Third, relations were often framed around conflicts, with little attention to possible ecosystem services. Fourth, most research was carried out using natural sciences methods, despite methods from the social sciences having much to offer in this context. Research fell into seven thematic clusters focusing on: (1) North-American bears, (2) African large carnivores, (3) social research in America, (4) meso-carnivores, (5) Asian felids, (6) conflicts with the grey wolf, and (7) damages to human property. These results highlight the need for more integrative, social-ecological research on human-carnivore relations. We discuss how addressing existing knowledge gaps could contribute to mitigating conflicts as well as fostering coexistence between humans and carnivore species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A small standing-water ecosystem (SWE) is a shallow (<20 m) lentic water body with a surface of a few hectares (≤10 ha). Compared to larger counterparts, they exhibit wider ecotones, sometimes even equaling their whole surface, which maximizes structural heterogeneity, supporting exceptionally high biodiversity, metabolic rates, and functionality. Surprisingly, no binding regulations support global strategies for SWE conservation. This work consists of a literature review performed for the period 2004-2018 to assess the ecological and conservation value of SWEs and the contribution of theWater Framework Directive (WFD) in promoting their conservation. Outcomes from this work open new perspectives on SWEs, which emerge as valuable ecosystems, and confirm their pivotal contribution to watershed biodiversity, resilience, and functionality. Results also suggest clear narrative trends and large knowledge gaps across geographical areas, biological components, and target issues. Additionally, we note that SWEs are under-represented in the frame of WFD implementation, stressing their marginality into assessing procedures. All of this calls for further studies, especially outside Europe and with a global, multi-taxon perspective. These should be devoted to quantitatively assess the roles of SWEs in maintaining global water ecosystem quality, biodiversity, and services, and to prioritize management actions for their conservation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Agri-environmental schemes (AESs) are increasingly implemented to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly practices by farmers. We use a systematic review to explore the role of behavioural factors and opportunity costs in farmers' decisions to participate in AESs in Australia, Europe and North America. Behavioural factors influence how farmers value and perceive options, while opportunity costs relate to farmers' forgone utility when choosing to participate in schemes. We synthesise insights from 79 articles and over 700 factors explaining the participation in AESs. We find that a set of behavioural factors seem consistently connected to participation, including agricultural training, advice and having positive attitudes towards AESs. Moreover, several factors related to opportunity costs also have a rather consistent relationship with AES participation, including market conditions, implementation efforts, profitability, and management and contract flexibility. However, many relationships of behavioural factors and opportunity costs with AES participation are not as consistent and generalizable as sometimes portrayed and require context-specific interpretation. Those factors with mixed results can still provide insights into farmers' participation decisions as several of them are either 'positively and insignificantly' or 'negatively and insignificantly' related to participation, such as environmental attitude, trust and farm size. These results suggest that their relationship with AES participation depends on other factors or the setting, highlighting interactions and raising important new research questions. Overall, our results provide several entry points for both researchers and policy-makers, highlighting uncertainties in relationships between factors and participation that should be considered when designing policies.

TI  - Biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing: Putting biofuels in the ecosystem services narrative
AU  - Gasparatos, A

T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - First generation biofuels provide a number of ecosystem services (e.g., fuel, climate regulation) but they also compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services) which are of paramount value to human wellbeing. However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB  - The growth of energy consumption demands a large expansion of transmission line (TL) networks worldwide. The reduction of the environmental impacts of these infrastructures will depend on the effectiveness of environmental impact assessments, that ultimately depend on the quality of the screening phase, the scoping phase, and the prioritization of potential environmental consequences. We conducted the first systematic review that encompasses all known potential impacts on biodiversity of the installation and operation of energy TLs, documented in the scientific literature and in a sample of Environmental Impact Studies (EIS). We examined 206 articles and 19 EIS and identified 28 impacts that correspond to biotic outcomes at the individual, population and community levels. Although scientific interest on TL impact evaluation is increasing, most studies have been focused on vertebrate taxa, especially birds. There are few published studies concerning habitat loss and the responses of functional groups with lower mobility or sensitive to physical alterations, such as amphibians. Most impacts appear in early stages of a project, during n construction, but persist during operation. We summarized the biotic impacts in a framework that may guide the screening of relevant impacts to be included in the EIS and consequently improve the outcomes of the environmental licensing process of transmission line projects.

T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide a number of life-sustaining services, from which benefits to humans can be derived. They are often inhabited by aquatic vegetation, such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes. Given their wide geographic distribution and coverage, there is need to prioritize conservation efforts. An understanding of the human importance of these ecosystems can help with that prioritization. Here, we summarize a literature review of ecosystem service valuation studies. We discuss (1) the degree to which current valuation information is sufficient to prioritize blue carbon habitat conservation and restoration, (2) the relevancy of available studies, and (3) what is missing from the literature that would be needed to effectively prioritize conservation. Given the recent focus on blue carbon ecosystems in the international conservation, there are a number of areas where research on blue forest ecosystem assessment and valuation could be improved, from enhancing available methodologies to increasing valuation of rarely studied ecosystem services and wider geographic coverage of valuation studies. This review highlights these gaps and calls for a focus on broadening the ecosystem services that are valued, the methods used, and increasing valuation in underrepresented regions.

TI  - A systematic review of the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity
AU  - Clucas, B

T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Urban agriculture is a unique form of agriculture that can provide fresh, local produce for urban residents, and may benefit biodiversity by decreasing the need to expand agriculture into natural areas as well as enhancing biodiversity in urban areas. However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.

AB  - In the face of biodiversity loss, it is crucial to broaden the arguments for conservation of protected areas by acknowledging diverse values of nature. We systematically reviewed empirical studies to investigate tourists' values of nature in protected areas over time and across regions. To do so, we explored (1) the main ecological and social characteristics of the case studies; (2) methodological approaches; and (3) value types. Based on the review of 152 articles, we found that economic valuation has received the most scientific attention, while socio-cultural valuation approaches have recently increased. Values were primarily elicited and analyzed quantitatively and in monetary metrics, although valuation methods and frameworks have diversified over the past two decades. However, considering the role of valuation methods and frameworks as value-articulating institutions, we suggest that future research on nature valuation also applies qualitative and non-monetary methods, elicits diverse values, and conducts plural valuation.

AB  - Mountains play a key role in the provision of nature's contributions to people (NCP) worldwide that support societies' quality of life. Simultaneously, mountains are threatened by multiple drivers of change. Due to the complex interlinkages between biodiversity, quality of life and drivers of change, research on NCP in mountains requires interdisciplinary approaches. In this study, we used the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the notion of NCP to determine to what extent previous research on ecosystem services in mountains has explored the different components of the IPBES conceptual framework. We conducted a systematic review of articles on ecosystem services in mountains published up to 2016 using the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Descriptive statistical and network analyses were conducted to explore the level of research on the components of the IPBES framework and their interactions. Our results show that research has gradually become more interdisciplinary by studying higher number of NCP, dimensions of quality of life, and indirect drivers of change. Yet, research focusing on biodiversity, regulating NCP and direct drivers has decreased over time. Furthermore, despite the fact that research on NCP in mountains becoming more policy-oriented over time, mainly in relation to payments for ecosystem services, institutional responses remained underexplored in the reviewed studies. Finally, we discuss the relevant knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research in order to contribute to IPBES.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach offers a more ecologically relevant method to establish environmental conservation goals and implement ecological risk assessment (ERA). The emergence of bibliometrics has facilitated the development of new systematic review techniques. In this study, we utilised CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and SciMAT software, based on the Web of Science database, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the ecosystem service-based ecological risk assessment (ESRA) literature knowledge map spanning from 1994 to 2023. This article explored the field's evolution from macro to micro perspectives, incorporating background information, current trends, and knowledge structure. The findings demonstrate that ESRA has progressed from an initial stage to a phase of global cooperation and policy applications. This transition between stages has been characterised by a shift from focusing on natural processes to understanding human impacts on ecosystems. Key themes identified include ecosystem services, landscape ERA, aquatic ERA and ecosystem health. The overall development of ERA can be observed as a progression through different periods, namely, the traditional era, regional era, and landscape era. Currently, landscape ERA methods based on changes in land use and land cover are widely employed. The study also revealed various challenges in the ESRA field, such as data availability, scale issues, and uncertainty. Future ESRA studies should consider holistic ecosystem services, interdisciplinary approaches, ecological models, and advanced technologies to address complexity. Using big data and informatisation for research offers new opportunities but requires integration and innovation. It is anticipated that ESRA holds promise for ecological sustainability and human wellbeing.

The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of urban provisioning ES, particularly when implementing an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach as it can offer improved resilience and quality of life in cities. We compiled and systematically analyzed studies on urban ES and ED related to a number of EGI typologies. Our systematic review of the relevant literature via an EGI framework, identified more than 80 peer-reviewed publications that focused on ES and food production in urban areas. An EGI approach can contribute socially, economically, and environmentally to urban sustainability and food security. However, such benefits must be weighed against ED trade-offs, including: potential health risks caused by human exposure to heavy metals and organic chemical contaminants often present in urban surroundings. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for incorporating EGI into urban planning and design, and discuss novel areas for future research.

T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The preservation of instream flows entails multiple benefits not only for river ecosystems but also for human well-being. Benefits of marketed goods and services provided by water withdrawals such as irrigation, water supply and hydropower production are well-known. Others, such as recreational, aesthetic, cultural and existence values of a well-preserved river flows are less studied. There is an increasing interest of policy makers to understand the benefits of costly river ecosystem restoration measures. Moreover, disregarding such benefits may turn into inter-stakeholder conflicts.        This paper reviews empirically-based literature assessing environmental flows restoration/conservation. Thus, it offers the state-of-the-art on three aspects: 1) what motivations drive the socioeconomic evaluation of instream flows (policies and alternative instream flow regimes); 2) what values and benefits are associated with instream flows (e.g. the sheer existence of a well-preserved river, productive assets and cultural attributes); and 3) what methods are employed to undertake such assessments (e.g. scenario development, monetary and non-monetary valuations, and stakeholders engagement).        Building on this, we propose a methodological framework for case-specific assessments of the restoration of environmental flows. This proposal combines increased stakeholder participation, better understanding of ecosystem functioning, awareness of the plurality of values and an accurate choice of valuation methods.

T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Evaluating the outcomes of wetland restoration projects is critical to improve practice and justify further investment in wetland restoration. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the economic valuation of the outcomes of wetland restoration. We assessed the economic methods applied, the attributes valued, and the timing of the evaluation in relation to the age of restoration along with publication trends. Research on the topic is increasing, but studies from Africa and South America are lacking. A diverse cross-disciplinary interest is notable, yet collaborations between disciplines are less frequent. Of particular concern is that only a third of the studies were undertaken postrestoration, and even fewer for restorations older than 10 years. Gaps in the knowledge base mean that our present understanding of the value achieved through wetland restoration is tentative. The need for postrestoration site-specific valuation efforts remains large both to justify further investment and to improve confidence in predictive and value transfer approaches as practical tools to inform decision-making.

AB  - Background: This systematic review will address the need for a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. As the number of dams continues to increase worldwide, so too has concerns for their effects on fish populations. Fish injury and mortality at hydroelectric facilities may have serious consequences for fish populations, which are generally the result of three main sources: (1) fish passage through hydroelectric facilities (i.e., turbines, spillways, sluiceways, and other passage routes) during downstream migration for migratory fish; (2) the entrainment of resident fish; and (3) the impingement of fish (migratory or resident) against screens/trash racks. Most studies on the impacts of entrainment and impingement at hydroelectric facilities on fish have primarily focused on: (1) how fish injury and mortality occurs; and (2) evaluations of the effectiveness of various management strategies used to mitigate harm during downstream passage. Given the contributions of migratory and resident adults and juveniles to fish production, a necessary extension is to evaluate the impacts of fish injury and mortality from hydropower dam entrainment and impingement on fish productivity. Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of fishes dependent on our freshwater ecosystems, a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity is needed.        Methods: This systematic review will search for, compile, summarize and synthesize evidence on the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. Considered studies will include (but not be limited to): (1) those that report a metric related to mortality and injury as an indication of the effect on fish productivity; (2) the change in a metric related to mortality and injury relative to an appropriate control; and (3) articles that scale-up the evaluation to include some estimate of a change in a component of fish productivity (e.g., articles that include an estimate of fish loss from the population due to entrainment/impingement by comparing a metric related to mortality or injury to an estimate of population size or biomass). Only studies where the causal relationship between intervention and outcome is made clear to allow for the effects of entrainment and impingement to be isolated from other potential impacts of hydroelectric power production (e.g., barriers to migration and/or habitat degradation), will be included. The review will use public search engines and specialist websites, and will include both primary and grey literature. Potential effect modifiers will be identified to obtain a better understanding of the factors that are associated with variation in effects among studies, given differences in: (1) site-specific factors (e.g., turbine type, size, power output); (2) methodologies and study designs used to assess impacts; and (3) biological factors (e.g., fish life history stage, body size and morphology). Study quality will be assessed to allow for critical evaluation, including study design, confounding factors and statistical analysis. Data will be compiled into a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis will be conducted where data availability and quality allow.

TI  - Assessing the impact of human trampling on vegetation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental evidence
AU  - Pescott, OL
AU  - Stewart, GB
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Vegetation trampling resulting from recreation can adversely impact natural habitats, leading to the loss of vegetation and the degradation of plant communities. A considerable primary literature exists on this topic, therefore it is important to assess whether this accumulated evidence can be used to reach general conclusions concerning vegetation vulnerability to inform conservation management decisions. Experimental trampling studies on a global scale were retrieved using a systematic review methodology and synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. The relationships between vegetation recovery and each of initial vegetation resistance, trampling intensity, time for recovery, Raunkiaer life-form (perennating bud position), and habitat were tested using random effects multiple meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The systematic search yielded 304 studies; of these, nine reported relevant randomized controlled experiments, providing 188 vegetation recovery effect sizes for analysis. The synthesis indicated there was significant heterogeneity in the impact of trampling on vegetation recovery. This was related to resistance and recovery time, and the interactions of these variables with Raunkiaer life-form, but was not strongly dependent on the intensity of the trampling experienced. The available evidence suggests that vegetation dominated by hemicryptophytes and geophytes recovers from trampling to a greater extent than vegetation dominated by other life-forms. Variation in effect within the chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte and geophyte life-form sub-groups was also explained by the initial resistance of vegetation to trampling, but not by trampling intensity. Intrinsic properties of plant communities appear to be the most important factors determining the response of vegetation to trampling disturbance. Specifically, the dominant Raunkiaer life-form of a plant community accounts for more variation in the resilience of communities to trampling than the intensity of the trampling experienced, suggesting that simple assessments based on this trait could guide decisions concerning sustainable access to natural areas. Methodological and reporting limitationsmust be overcome before more disparate types of evidence can be synthesised; this would enable more reliable extrapolation to non-study situations, and a more comprehensive understanding of how assessments of intrinsic plant traits can be used to underpin conservation management decisions concerning access.

T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Predation pressure on vulnerable bird species has made predator control an important issue for international nature conservation. Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation.

AU  - Stewart, R
AU  - Jian, JS
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) has the potential to sustain soil productivity and benefit agroecosystems, yet it is not fully understood how yield responses of different cropping systems are affected by inherent soil characteristics, for example, texture and dynamic soil properties, such as aggregation, nutrients and erosion. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to compare crop yield from cropland with conventional management versus different CA practices, specifically reduced- or no-tillage, agroforestry, organic farming and cover crops. The data were first analysed for different climatic regions, soil textures and cash crop types. We then quantified how yield responses correlated with soil properties change under different CA practices. The results showed that CA practices were associated with an overall mean crop yield increase of 12%. This response was primarily driven by corn, which had a mean yield increase of almost 41% after CA implementation, whereas other cash crops did not have significant yield responses or showed slight decreases, as rotation with mixtures of multiple cash crops had a mean decrease of 6% when using CA. The increase in corn yield after CA may be related to the enhanced ability of that crop to absorb nutrient elements (e.g. nitrogen) and reduce nutrient leaching. Agroforestry increased crop yield by 66% and cover cropping increased yield by 11%, likely due to increases in soil water content and nutrient availability and decreases in erosion and surface runoff. However, other agricultural systems showed no significant increase after CA compared with conventional row cropping practices. Using CA practices had the greatest yield benefit in tropical climates and when farming in coarse-textured soils. In addition, legumes and grass-legume mixtures resulted in significant cash crop yield increases, possibly because legumes promoted the increase of soil nitrogen and depleted soil moisture less compared with other cover crops. The results provide new insight into how interactions between soil properties and CA practices affect crop yield and at the same time can help guide the development of practical, evidence-based guidelines for using conservation practices to improve yield in corn and other cash crops.

TI  - Woodland Establishment Reduces Nutrient Losses to Waterbodies in Urban Catchments: A Review of the Evidence
AU  - Hutchins, MG
AU  - Qu, YM
AU  - Baker, HJ
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was undertaken to establish benefits of urban forests on reducing nutrient concentrations in adjacent or downstream waterbodies. Following screening, a small number of articles (40) were found relevant, representing studies quantifying non-point source nutrient losses from urban and peri-urban environments. Evidence was split between plot- and catchment-scale. Plot-scale studies often included evaluations of engineered nature-based solutions. At catchment-scale, studies of streamwater quality typically investigated influence of contributory catchment nutrient sources. Wide ranges of beneficial reductions were apparent, and at both scales not all studies identified significant benefits. Summarizing against this backdrop, at plot (micro-) scale woodland reduces mean concentrations in runoff, soil or groundwater by an average of 44.2% for total nitrogen (TN) and 47.0% for total phosphorus (TP). At catchment (meso-) scale, evidence suggests a 20% areal addition of forest at the expense of mixed urban fabric can reduce mean concentrations by 15.7% and 12.6% for TN and TP respectively. Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts. Canopy cover suppresses stream channel biological nitrogen uptake, which based on all evidence appears considerable. However, unshaded headwaters can foster accelerated primary productivity with undesirable downstream consequences. Overall, gathering further evidence is encouraged, given current uncertainties, especially to address differences between impervious, permeable and riparian urban woodland settings.

T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Current sustainability challenges - including biodiversity loss, pollution and land-use change require new ways of understanding, acting in and caring for the landscapes we live in. The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a 'boundary object'; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act as a helpful 'centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.

AB  - Human-induced changes in river flow regimes are ubiquitous worldwide. Although numerous case studies have identified negative ecological impacts of changes in different aspects of flow regimes (e.g. magnitude, timing), there have been few attempts to systematically review this literature to derive general relationships regarding ecological responses to changes in flow regimes. Systematic literature reviews can inform science and management in ecologically complex systems not amenable to experimentation. However, such analysis of existing literature is often limited by inconsistent study design and data reporting. To attempt to overcome these difficulties, we used the recently developed Eco Evidence method and software to analyse 165 studies of ecological responses to changes in river flow regimes. Eco Evidence provides a rule set and standardised list of terms to assist reviewers to interpret consistently the results of disparate studies. The companion software assists with the synthesis of this information to reach transparent and repeatable conclusions regarding cause-effect hypotheses of ecological responses to environmental drivers. We compared our results to those of a recent, informal systematic review of the same studies, which is proving extremely influential. Stronger conclusions are reached when evidence is weighted, classified and combined according to the rules in Eco Evidence. Compared to the original review, we reached informative conclusions for a larger number of flow-response hypotheses, found that hypotheses for which the most evidence was available returned inconsistent results, addressed hypotheses at levels of conceptual resolution relevant to management and identified where insufficient evidence exists to reach a conclusion. Analyses conducted at several levels of conceptual resolution found strong support for many hypotheses regarding ecological impacts. We found a consistent sensitivity to changes in flow regime for both fish and riparian vegetation across a variety of performance metrics. While macroinvertebrate responses varied among performance metrics (e.g. abundance was negatively affected by increases or decreases in flows, diversity was only negatively affected by flow decreases, and assemblage structure was affected by neither), they were largely consistent within these metrics. We thus conclude that the Eco Evidence approach allowed us to extract more knowledge from the data set than was possible in the original review. Eco Evidence can improve synthesis of the burgeoning ecological literature and improve our general understanding in ecology. Amid widespread calls for evidence-based' environmental management, this powerful tool provides managers with a means of using research to help inform complex environmental decision-making.

AB  - Water quality is declining worldwide and an increasing number of waterbodies lose their ecological function due to human population growth and climate change. Constructed floating wetlands (CFWs) are a promising ecological engineering tool for restoring waterbodies. The functionality of CFWs has been studied in-situ, in mesocosms and in the laboratory, but a systematic review of the success of in situ applications to improve ecosystem health is missing to date.        This review summarises the pollutant dynamics in the presence of CFWs and quantifies removal efficiencies for major pollutants with a focus on in situ applications, including studies that have only been published in the Chinese scientific literature. We find that well designed CFWs successfully decrease pollutant concentrations and improve the health of the ecosystem, shown by lower algae biomass and more diverse fish, algae and invertebrate communities. However, simply extrapolating pollutant removal efficiencies from small-scale experiments will lead to overestimating the removal capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter of in situ applications. We show that predicted climate change and eutrophication scenarios will likely increase the efficiency rate of CFWs, mainly due to increased growth and pollutant uptake rates at higher temperatures. However, an increase in rainfall intensity could lead to a lower efficiency of CFWs due to shorter hydraulic retention times and more pollutants being present in the particulate, not the dissolved form. Finally, we develop a framework that will assist water resource managers to design CFWs for specific management purposes. Our review clearly highlights the need of more detailed in situ studies, particularly in terms of understanding the short- and long-term ecosystem response to CFWs under different climate change scenarios.

T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - The unsustainable harvest of wildlife is a major threat to global biodiversity and to the millions of people who depend on wildlife for food and income. Past research has called attention to the fact that commonly used methods to evaluate the sustainability of wildlife hunting perform poorly, yet these methods remain in popular use today. Here, we conduct a systematic review of empirical sustainability assessments to quantify the use of sustainability indicators in the scientific literature and highlight associations between analytical methods and their outcomes. We find that indicator type, continent of study, species body mass, taxonomic group and socio-economic status of study site are important predictors of the probability of reported sustainability. The most common measures of sustainability include population growth models, the Robinson & Redford (1991) model and population trends through time. Indicators relying on population-specific biological data are most often used in North America and Europe, while cruder estimates are more often used in Africa, Latin America and Oceania. Our results highlight both the uncertainty and lack of uniformity in sustainability science. Given our urgent need to conserve both wildlife and the food security of rural peoples around the world, improvements in sustainability indicators are of utmost importance.

TI  - Roads and bats: a meta-analysis and review of the evidence on vehicle collisions and barrier effects
AU  - Fensome, AG
AU  - Mathews, F
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - Roads are a potential threat to bat conservation. In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats - notably woodland - was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Despite expanding urban areas and increased awareness of urbanization impacts on wildlife, trends in urban wildlife studies have not been evaluated systematically. We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - Background: Property rights to natural resources comprise a major policy instrument in efforts to advance sustainable resource use and conservation. Debate over the relative effectiveness of different property rights regimes in reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the links between property rights regimes and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems.        Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence from the past two decades on the environmental impacts of property rights regimes in fisheries, forests and range-lands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and community property regimes, as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive, negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influence effect of property rights regimes on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three languages, resulting in a total of 34,984 screened titles.        Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 property regime studies: 55% of the studies related to forestry, 31% to fisheries, and 14% to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case-control studies but presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. We found that property regime comparisons differed across resource domains with, for example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmental outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pressure, and the presence or absence of clear, stable and legitimate rights (i.e. 'positive regime characteristics').        Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclusions about the environmental impacts of different property rights regimes within or across resource systems. The majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on property rights regimes would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe property rights regime characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes.

AB  - As urbanization continues to expand across the globe, urban wildlife research is critical for urban planners and conservation practitioners to create livable cities for both humans and wildlife. In 2012, Magle et al. conducted a foundational review on the status of urban wildlife research. The authors described the status of urban wildlife research as of 2010 and offered suggestions for future advancements in the field. We conducted a systematic review following Magle et al. (2012) to provide a 10-year update on the state of urban wildlife research globally and describe recent advancements in the field. We also conducted a broader literature search to further explore current research trends and continuing research gaps within the urban wildlife field. We found that urban wildlife publications have continued to increase within the last decade. However, the sectors conducting the research and the geographical location of publications stayed relatively the same. Similarly, the predominant taxa studied were mammals and birds across the 2000-2020 decades. After broadening our literature search, we were able to identify a new emphasis on management-related research and research in the fields of disease ecology, social science, and methodological development. Critical knowledge gaps remain, however, as there was still a significant lack of studies on herptiles, arthropods, and fish. Additionally, studies from Africa, South America, and Asia - three of the fastest urbanizing continents - were underrepresented. Our results provide conservation practitioners a summary of emerging topics and recommendations for future research that will contribute to creating healthier and more livable cities for both wildlife and people.

TI  - A systematic review of the global freshwater mussel restoration toolbox
AU  - Eveleens, RA
AU  - Febria, CM
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Halting the global decline of freshwater mussels requires an improved understanding of the restoration approaches currently in use and the identification of shortcomings to inform the development of new ones. This article reviews published evaluations of restoration efforts on the ground and those identified or proposed in the literature. This review found few reports of the effectiveness of restoration measures, and of those reported there was strong temporal and geographical bias. Reports were mostly recent and took place within mussel-diverse regions of the Global North (i.e. North America, Europe). Efforts focused on population support encompassed relocation, translocation and population augmentation from captive breeding, and potential restoration approaches emphasized planning and prioritization. It was challenging to assess restoration success owing to differences in success metrics and varied lengths of post-restoration monitoring. Some measures were inherently more species specific, such as population support, but some articles suggested that the use of multiple measures may allow more species to be addressed by restoration efforts. Consistent documentation and reporting of restoration measures - including failed ones - are needed to advance freshwater mussel restoration. In addition, continued work is needed to accelerate and better align the development and use of restoration approaches for freshwater mussels. Reporting of unsuccessful or partially successful attempts does not adequately reflect the long life histories of freshwater mussels. Investigation of the contexts where approaches have been effective (even partially), and concerted efforts to implement combinations of measures at a catchment scale are critical for unionids globally. As such, recommendations are posed to aid integration of research and practice to advance and further develop freshwater mussel restoration.

TI  - Permaculture for agroecology: design, movement, practice, and worldview. A review
AU  - Ferguson, RS
AU  - Lovell, ST
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations. (5) And scholarship in permaculture has always been a diverse marginal sector, but is growing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
AB  - Syntheses of knowledge are important to reveal trends, biases and gaps in the scientific literature, indicating main data shortfalls and research needs. In this regard, the authors conducted a broad systematic review on the literature about freshwater fish eggs and larvae to investigate (a) temporal trends in the global scientific production, (b) the scope and habitat types, (c) the spatial distribution of studies, (d) the fish species contemplated and their respective conservation status and (e) the factors associated with the spatial distribution of studies. They analysed 654 studies published between 1950 and 2020. The number of studies has increased over time, but with a weak trend. Most studies investigated basic questions about biology and ecology and were carried out chiefly in rivers and lakes. These studies covered 95 freshwater ecoregions (22.3% of all ecoregions) and recorded 871 fish species (4.8% of all freshwater fish currently described). Most species were assessed by the IUCN and classified into six threat categories, but approximately 35% were not evaluated. The main drivers affecting the spatial distribution of studies were ecoregion area, road density, river volume and the number of hydroelectric plants. Results point to significant biases and gaps in the global scientific literature on fish eggs and larvae, especially associated with habitat type, spatial distribution and target species, emphasizing the need to address specific topics. Such biases and gaps indicate the existence of important data shortfalls, which compromise management and conservation planning, as information on fish eggs and larvae is basic and critical for the assessment of fish recruitment and population dynamics.

TI  - Do property tax benefits for forest landowners work? A review of effectiveness at retaining and promoting active management of private forests
AU  - Frey, G.E.
T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Over the past several decades, concern about loss of forest-based ecosystem services has caused all fifty states to adopt programs to lower property taxes on enrolled private forestland. Although there has been a moderate amount of research on the effectiveness of these preferential forest property tax programs (PFPTPs), most studies only assess individual states, explore perceptions without an empirical basis, or present seemingly contradictory findings. This manuscript presents a systematic review of literature to determine the strength of evidence supporting PFPTPs’ effectiveness at retaining and also promoting active management of private forests. There is moderate evidence that PFPTPs reduce forest land-use change, parcelization, or sales, although the effect apparently is relatively weak. There is very little evidence that PFPTPs encourage more active forest management. To design a PFPTP that does more to retain forests, studies indicate that a PFPTP may need fewer requirements and rules, whereas to encourage active management a PFPTP may need more. Thus, greater clarity of policy goals will help determine which approach is merited. © 2022
