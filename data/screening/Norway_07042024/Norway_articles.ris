AB  - Eurasian lynx are often regarded as being particularly sensitive to human land-use. However, in the European context where human influence is pervasive, the conservation of lynx requires that they be integrated into the human-dominated landscape. Although previous studies have looked at how lynx respond to human land-use in a broad sense, they have failed to examine the details of how different types of human induced impacts (forest fragmentation, human density, different types of transport infrastructure) influence distinct lynx behaviors. Furthermore, they have not examined the extent to which lynx modify their fine scaled avoidance behavior of anthropogenic landscape features according to the specific behaviors (resting sites, kill sites, movement) in which they are engaged and how these relationships are modified by prey density or the sex of the lynx. We used Resource Selection Functions to examine how 19 GPS-marked lynx in southeastern Norway responded to an index of cumulative human habitat modification while engaged in different activities. We found that lynx select for areas with medium levels of human modification, avoiding both the very highly modified and the areas with low degrees of modification. Females in general appear to be less tolerant of human modification than males, especially when it comes to resting sites. Terrain (ruggedness and elevation) appears to be important in permitting lynx to exploit heavily modified areas. Our study demonstrates that lynx show a nuanced response to human habitat modification, which offers hope for their conservation in Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents results from a multidisciplinary study of a negotiation process between farmers and wildlife authorities which led to an agricultural subsidy scheme to alleviate conflicts between agriculture and geese in Norway. The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesteralen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesteralen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.

AB  - Deer (Cervidae) cause considerable damage to forest plantations, crops, and protected habitats. The most common response to this damage is to implement strategies to lower population densities. However, lowering deer density may not always be desirable from hunting, recreational, or conservation perspectives. Therefore, knowledge is needed about additional factors beyond deer density that affect damage levels, and management actions that consider competing management goals. We studied the relationships between levels of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (1) relative deer density indices (pellet group count and deer harvest data), (2) availability of alternative natural forage (cover of forage species) and (3) proportion forest in the landscape, both at a forest stand scale and at a landscape scale. Extensive variation in damage level was evident between the six study areas. On a stand scale, the proportion of spruce damaged was positively related to pellet group density, indicating the importance of local deer usage of stands. In addition, available alternative forage in the field layer within spruce stands and proportion forest surrounding stands was negatively related to damage level. On the landscape scale, damage level was negatively related to availability of forage in the field and shrub layers and proportion forest, but was not related to any of the relative deer density indices. Increasing alternative forage may thus decrease damage and thereby reduce conflicts. Additionally, the proportion of forest in the landscape affects damage levels and should thus be considered in landscape planning and when forecasting damage risk. The relationship between local deer usage of stands and damage level suggests that future studies should try to separate the effects of local deer usage and deer density.

AB  - The decline in farmland birds observed throughout Europe during recent decades has attracted much attention. Agricultural intensification or land abandonment are commonly forwarded as key drivers. Several countries have established agri-environmental schemes (AES) to counter these negative trends among farmland birds. This paper reports a study of the relationship between land use and bird species in the agricultural landscape of Norway. The main objective was to investigate the effect of spatial heterogeneity and diversity of land use on total richness and abundance of farmland birds at a national level. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of birds is part of the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes. The monitoring programme is based on mapping of 1 x 1 km squares distributed across the entire agricultural landscape. Within these squares permanent observation points are established for bird monitoring. Detailed interpretation of aerial photographs provides the land classification. We tested the relationship between landscape metrics at different levels of land type detail and species richness and abundance of farmland and non-farmland birds. There was a positive relationship between species richness and abundance of farmland birds and agricultural area. For non-farmland birds the relationship was negative. Spatial heterogeneity of land use was a significant positive factor for both farmland and non -farmland species. High land type diversity was positive for farmland bird richness, but negative for abundance. Non -farmland bird richness was not affected by land type diversity, but abundance had a negative response. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of a spatial heterogeneous landscape. However, we also found that land type diversity could negatively affect the abundance of both farmland and non -farmland birds. Our findings suggest a need for different management approaches depending on whether the aim is increased species richness or abundance. Achieving both aims with the same means might be difficult. We thus suggest a need for land use analyses before proper management strategies can be implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat selection studies generally assume that animals select habitat and food resources at multiple scales to maximise their fitness. However, animals sometimes prefer habitats of apparently low quality, especially when considering the costs associated with spatially heterogeneous human disturbance. We used spatial variation in human disturbance, and its consequences on lynx survival, a direct fitness component, to test the Hierarchical Habitat Selection hypothesis from a population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in southern Norway. Data from 46 lynx monitored with telemetry indicated that a high proportion of forest strongly reduced the risk of mortality from legal hunting at the home range scale, while increasing road density strongly increased such risk at the finer scale within the home range. We found hierarchical effects of the impact of human disturbance, with a higher road density at a large scale reinforcing its negative impact at a fine scale. Conversely, we demonstrated that lynx shifted their habitat selection to avoid areas with the highest road densities within their home ranges, thus supporting a compensatory mechanism at fine scale enabling lynx to mitigate the impact of large-scale disturbance. Human impact, positively associated with high road accessibility, was thus a stronger driver of lynx space use at a finer scale, with home range characteristics nevertheless constraining habitat selection. Our study demonstrates the truly hierarchical nature of habitat selection, which aims at maximising fitness by selecting against limiting factors at multiple spatial scales, and indicates that scale-specific heterogeneity of the environment is driving individual spatial behaviour, by means of trade-offs across spatial scales.

AB  - The importance of considering spatial dimensions in welfare analysis is increasingly acknowledged, but there are still knowledge gaps. For this purpose, we turn to environmental psychology and use place attachment, the functional and emotional bond people have to a defined place. We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model. Place attachment may provide valuable information on the affected populations when evaluating land-use policies.

AB  - Abstract The increasing demand for visiting wilderness areas often requires management actions that both conserve the natural resources and ensure a high quality visitor experience. Many of the alpine national parks in southern Norway hold the last remaining populations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Therefore management needs more effective tools to reduce or remove recreational impact on wild reindeer populations. Management actions should also consult research-based knowledge on visitors. Therefore, this study explores the link between visitor motivations and their attitudes towards management actions on track-related (trail, path, trampling, track) and area-related (zoning, legal restrictions) use. The results show that two of the visitor motivations (i.e. hiking and place attachment) affect visitors’ attitudes towards management restrictions on use significantly. For instance, those visiting the national park for hiking are more positive to area-related restrictions while individuals attached to the place are more positive to track-related restrictions. Practical and theoretical implications are also discussed. Management implications When attempting to find socio-ecological solutions for conflicts between a wild reindeer population and recreational use, the following management recommendations should be considered: – A management solution should regard the fact that local users differ significantly from non-local visitors. – The strategy of ‘area restriction’ is highly controversial for local communities, due to their long tradition with subsistence harvesting, grazing and traditional agriculture; therefore such a strategy will receive only low approval among the locals and leave the management with low legitimacy at the local level. – The strategy of ‘management of the track system’ will affect most non-local visitors, but these visitors are more flexible in adapting to a new trail system in the area, or may shift to another area. – Visitors with strong place attachment, as well as wilderness seekers who desire solitude are difficult to influence with physical management actions. – A management strategy that will limit the area of use and behaviour of off-track visitors should include information about ecosystem vulnerability.

AB  - Berry-producing Vaccinium shrubs are keystone species in boreal forest ecosystems and their berries provide an essential food source for many vertebrates. In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris. In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns. We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.

AB  - Growth, density and production of juvenile Atlantic salmon and brown trout were studied in three different sections of the Kvassheimsana River in south-western Norway from 1979 to 1983. Section 1. in the upper part of the river, is located above a waterfall impassable for migratory salmonids and is surrounded by grazing land. Sections 2 and 3, in the middle and lower parts of the river, are influenced by agricultural activity. Total nitrogen concentration varied between 250 and 1000 μg l −1 in section 1 and 1500 and 2500 μg l−1 in sections 2 and 3. Total phosphorus (Tot-P) concentrations also increased with decreasing altitude: 19–46 μg l−1 in section I and 31–101 μg l −1 in sections 2 and 3. The number of 0 + salmon in sections 2 and 3 varied between 30.1 and 167.8 specimens 100 m −2, with means 90.2 and 95.2 specimens 100 m −2:, respectively; the density of 1 + salmon, with mean values of 16.3 and 51.0 specimens 100m−2 was significantly correlated with the original fry density. The growth rate of 0+ salmon was not inversely related to cohort density, but was significantly so for 1 + salmon. Mean annual salmon production in section 2 was 1595 g 100 m−2 year 1, and in section 3 was 841 g 100m−2 year 1. A logarithmic function gave the best curve fit between salmon production and mean annual biomass. Thus, production levelled off for the highest values recorded in section 2, and perhaps approached the carrying capacity of the stream. A multiple regression analysis showed that yearly variation in 1 + salmon density was the single factor accounting for most of the total variability in production (60%). Variation in water temperature and nutrient content were not significantly related to variation in fish production. Densities of brown trout were low in all sections (<20 specimens 100m −2). Fry density was highest in section 3 and parr density in section 1. All age groups of sympatric brown trout grew significantly faster in sections 2 and 3 compared with allopatric brown trout in section 1.

AB  - Abstract Small mammals, especially microtine rodents, play an important role in the dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems. Even-aged forest management, in which old, semi-natural forests are converted to clear-cuts and culturally regenerated stands, is expected to have pronounced impact on the abundance and composition of this group of animals due to changes in the understory vegetation. During a 39 year-period we sampled autumn numbers of small mammals in uncut, semi-natural old forest and in recent clearcuts, supplemented by a 7-year sample from middle-aged plantations. Field voles Microtus agrestis were almost exclusively trapped in clearcuts. Bank voles Myodes glareolus dominated in the old forest, but reached equal or higher densities than field voles in clearcuts. Here, their combined abundance exceeded that of bank voles in old forest. Some years, wood lemmings Myopus schisticolor contributed significantly to vole abundance in old forest. Other rodents Apodemus spp. were rarely captured, mainly in clearcuts, and shrews Sorex spp. numbered

AB  - Outdoor recreation is increasing and affects habitat use and selection by wildlife. These effects are challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation affects habitat selection at the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We fitted resource selection functions at the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation. Scale-dependent responses and temporal adjustments in habitat use may facilitate coexistence between humans and large carnivores.

AB  - Roe deer Capreolus capreolus food and feeding habitat selection was studied by snow tracking on transects along an altitudinal gradient in Flatdal, the county of Telemark, south-central Norway, during winter 1979/80. The main food was bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus (36.8%), rowan Sorbus aucuparia (24.4%) and arboreal lichens Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryonia spp., Hypogymnia physodes, Usnea spp. (17.4%), which were also the only preferred food plants. The amount of food removed from the field layer was stable through the winter. Roe deer used the lower part of the study area most heavily. At lower altitudes, older mature stands and edges between medium-aged stands and clear-cuts/plantations were preferred, pole-sized stands and edges between older mature stands and clear-cuts/plantations were used as expected from their availabilities, whereas medium-aged stands, clear-cuts and young plantations were avoided. That snow depth was an important factor determining habitat use by roe deer was evident in three ways: 1) use of areas at higher elevations decreased as winter progressed, 2) use of mature forest stands increased from early to late winter relative to open habitats, and 3) use of mature forest stands was more extensive at higher than at lower elevations compared to open habitats.

AB  - Summary 1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species’ selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1·5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications . A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.

AB  - Whether road verge vegetation can be manipulated to resemble traditionally managed grassland has been much debated. This short-term study compared management effects on road verge and pasture vegetation in western Norway. We quantified vegetation change and explored whether it occurred along underlying environmental gradients. We found management-related variation in species richness and vegetation physiognomy, but high resistance in species composition prevented directional changes in vegetation dynamics. Initial differences between the habitats indicated historical management effects on traditionally managed pastures and road verges. Given proper management, road verges may have a nature conservation potential. Moreover, their linear structure may enable fine-scale mosaic management that allows the coexistence of a wide range of grassland species.

AB  - Conservation efforts have secured the partial recovery of Europe's wild reindeer, although only in 24 separate fragments of their original range, now separated by resorts and roads. Full recovery of the original range will require restoration of migration routes across developed or disturbed areas. We analyzed distribution of around 3500 Rangifer tarandus tarandus (reindeer) during winters (1984–2005) in relation to 10 alpine resorts and prior to and following relocation of ski trails and cabins in Norway done to restore use of former habitat. Reindeer used areas within 15 km of resorts, which is less than expected based on the availability of habitat, most likely as a result of cross-country skiing activity surrounding the resorts, limiting their access to other ranges and historic migration corridors. Reindeer abundance declined and mean distance between reindeer groups and resorts increased with increasing resort size. No apparent habituation to resorts was observed during the 20-year study period. However, when ski trails and an associated tourist cabin were removed to restore access to historic habitat, reindeer moved into the area. No such change in reindeer distribution was observed in the 10 years preceding relocation, or at the other nine resorts where no such experiments were conducted. Regulation of human traffic, relocation of trails, and removal of infrastructure and cabins are apparently effective in restoring access to and use of historic ranges and migration routes. However, restoration of historic migration routes between ranges will likely require the removal of hundreds of recreational cabins in order to become effective.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>River regulation alters flow and sediment regime, habitat availability, and ultimately the ecological functioning of rivers. Various restoration and mitigation measures have been developed to improve ecological function, and among them is the addition of gravel to enhance the reproduction of gravel bed spawning fishes. However, information on long-term efficiency, costs, and maintenance needs of gravel additions are scarce. Here, we study the functioning of gravel additions at eight sites in three rivers in western Norway for up to 18 years. Gravel was added between 2002 and 2010 to enhance spawning of Atlantic salmon and anadromous Brown trout. We monitored changes in the size of the gravel-covered areas, sediment composition, interstitial oxygen, egg survival, and juvenile fish densities. Additionally, we report monetary costs, identify potential maintenance needs, and calculate a cost-benefit ratio. Juvenile densities of Atlantic salmon and Brown trout increased significantly after the gravel augmentations. After 10–18 years, the median egg survival was still high (&gt; 90%) and sediment conditions were still suitable for salmonid fish reproduction. The areas were, however, shrinking across time (median area reduction 26%), mostly caused by scouring of gravel in the steep, supply-limited, and partly regulated rivers. The average construction costs of spawning gravel augmentations were 11.2 NOK (1.12 €) m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Compared to similar measures elsewhere, the measures have had a long life span (up to 18 years) at relatively low costs.

AB  - Conservation of forest biodiversity has brought about an interest in evaluating the naturalness of forests, and to locate and protect semi-natural and old-growth forests in the Fennoscandian countries. However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50−100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at lownor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today.

AB  - Controversies over large carnivores are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural com- munities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modern- ization will increase the diversity. To probe such diverse and changing at- titudes towards nature, I conducted a qualitative study of young people in a rural community in eastern Norway. Contrary to popular images of such communities as unified against "pests," all typical views of the car- nivore issue were present. Those in favor of the large carnivores were typically middle-class youths with a strong "outward" orientation, while those who wanted to shoot the predators were mostly working-class boys with strong ties to the local hunting culture. This pattern was interpreted as a conflict between dominant and subordinate forms of knowledge, and between abstraction-oriented and production-oriented cultural forms. Aside from the growth of the pro-carnivore middle-class seg- ments, the most significant effect of modernization appeared to be the removal of many young people from the subject matter of the conflict. A "subculturalization" of the working-class hunting culture also could be discerned, however. After decades of protection, the four species of large carnivores found in mainland Norway (brown bear, lynx, wolverine, and wolf) are now slowly recovering from the brink of extinction. This development is applauded by environmentalists, managers, biolo- gists, and many politicians. Opinion polls also indicate enthusiasm in a majority of the general population. Increasing carnivore populations have spurred fierce conflicts, however. Livestock depredation and competition for huntable game are key issues, but the killing of hunting dogs and the possibility of attacks on people also feature in the controversies. In the public debate it is often suggested that this is a conflict representing a clash between old and new perspectives on nature, or rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Whereas this seems to touch some core issues, we know little about the operative mechanisms. In particular, we know little of how young people are handling such issues.

During the next 4 1/2 years reindeer were followed from the ground, or by radiolocations from an airplane. On the average one animal was tagged per 42 animals in any group. A total sample of 175 locations in all seasons indicated that snow conditions, traffic on a road lying parallel to a railroad, and the damming of a lake significantly affected annual distribution as compared with expected modern as well as prehistoric distribution.

AB  - Although biodiversity is crucial for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), following the current trajectory, we risk failing SDG 15. Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km<sup>2</sup> of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km<sup>2</sup>). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km<sup>2</sup>) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs. Using indices of functional connectivity is crucial for environmental impact assessments, as entire ecological networks for several species can be affected far beyond the reservoirs.

AB  - Depredation on livestock and competition with hunters for game species are prominent among the conflicts that the return of large carnivores generates in multi-use landscapes. The relative magnitude of the conflict strongly depends on what prey selection patterns predators will adopt once established in a new area. We explored prey selection and kill rates from 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Southern Norway, between 2006 and 2011, using Global Positioning System collars. We recorded 603 lynx predation events on a wide range of prey species, ranging from passerines to large ungulates. During summer, domestic sheep were the most frequent prey, representing 64% of the ungulates killed, for an average kill rate of 8.2/100 days, whereas roe deer Capreolus capreolus were killed in about 33% of cases (kill rate = 4.2/100 days). In winter, when sheep were unavailable, roe deer were the most frequent prey, accounting for about 73% of the kills, for an average kill rate of 9.4/100 days, whereas red deer were found at 17% of the kill sites, corresponding to a kill rate of 2.2/100 days. Lynx-killed prey provided an average of 400 kg of meat per 100 days, irrespective of prey density. In both seasons, the proportion of each species killed by lynx was determined by the combined effect of all prey densities, so that the density of wild ungulates had the potential to affect the rate of depredation on sheep, to the same extent as the abundance of sheep could influence the kill rate on wild ungulates. Our results underline the complexity of carnivore–ungulate trophic interactions in multi-use landscapes where livestock and wildlife co-occur, and suggest that changes in densities of prey, predators or both may produce undesired outcomes, if such complexity is not taken into account during the decision-making process for management and conservation.

AB  - Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e.g., food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.

AB  - Inclusion of spatially explicit information on ecosystem services in conservation planning is a fairly new practice. This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2%) and the non-use zone (+3.2%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79%.

AB  - Abstract Worldwide semi-natural habitats of high biological value are in decline. Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of “adaptive management”, where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway’s Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK – which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.

AB  - Habitat destruction is today the most severe threat to global biodiversity. Despite decades of efforts, there is still no proper methodology on how to assess all aspects of impacts on biodiversity from land use and land use changes (LULUC) in life cycle analysis (LCA). A majority of LCA studies on land extensive activities still do not include LULUC. In this study, we test different approaches for assessing the impact of land use and land use change related to hydropower for use in LCA and introduce restoration cost as a new approach. We assessed four hydropower plant projects in planning phase (two upgrading plants with reservoir and two new run-of-river plants) in Southern Norway with comparable geography, biodiversity, and annual energy production capacity. LULUC was calculated for each habitat type, based on mapping of present and future land use, and was further allocated to energy production for each power plant. Three different approaches to assess land use impact were included: ecosystem scarcity/vulnerability, biogenic greenhouse gas (bGHG) emissions, and the cost of restoring affected habitats. Restoration cost represents a novel approach to LCA for measuring impact of LULUC. Overall, the three approaches give similar rankings of impacts: larger impact for small and new power plants and less for larger and expanding existing plants. Reservoirs caused a larger total area affected. Permanent infrastructure has a more similar absolute impact for run-of-river and reservoir-based hydropower, and consequently give relatively larger impact for smaller run-of-river hydropower. All approaches reveal impacts on wetland ecosystems as most important relative to other ecosystems. The methods used for all three approaches would benefit from higher resolution data on land use, habitats, and soil types. Total restoration cost is not accurate, due to uncertainty of offset ratios, but relative restoration costs may still be used to rank restoration alternatives and compare them to the costs of biodiversity offsets. The different approaches assess different aspects of land use impacts, but they all show large variation of impact between the studied hydropower plants, which shows the importance of including LULUC in LCA for hydropower projects. Improved data of total restoration cost (and cost accounting) are needed to implement this approach in future LCA.

AB  - How do parties mobilise cultural expertise in Indigenous rights litigation in Scandinavia? Recently, Sami groups have litigated to claim Indigenous rights to land and natural resources, winning some remarkable victories in the Supreme Courts of Norway and Sweden. In this paper, we draw on socio-legal mobilisation theory to analyse the epistemic strategies of Sami litigants and their adversaries in two recent landmark Supreme Court cases on Indigenous rights to usage of land: the 2020 Girjas case in Sweden and the 2021 Fosen case in Norway. Conceptualising cultural expertise as a strategic framing contest, we analyse how the parties struggled over the epistemic basis of the respective case by legitimating their claims to cultural knowledge, drawing on academic research, and discrediting their opponents’ epistemic claims. Our findings suggest that in both cases, Sami claimants successfully established an epistemic basis where their traditional, experiential knowledge combined with independent academic expertise effectively challenged the knowledge claims of their adversaries. Yet, both cases also demonstrate how the linkage between Sami Indigeneity and reindeer husbandry in the national law of both countries excludes non-reindeer herding Sami persons from the Indigenous rights affirmed by the courts. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Resilience expresses the capacity of a social-ecological system to adapt to, absorb, or withstand perturbations and other stressors so that the system remains. Reindeer nomadic husbandry is a coupled social-ecological system that sustains resilience by interacting with the animals and environment: either the herders adjust their actions to animal behavior or change this behavior in ways that suit the herd and pastures. Stressors and shocks affecting Sámi reindeer husbandry are, for instance, sudden warm air temperatures with subsequent snow melting and freezing in winter, bad grazing conditions, loss of grazing lands, and even socio-economic reforms. All these are sudden, unprepared, or forced changes. Climate change resilience includes using reindeer herders’ Indigenous knowledge of selective breeding by maintaining different phenotypes of reindeer such as non-productive and castrated animals in the herd. Nevertheless, in Sámi reindeer husbandry in Norway today, low numbers of male reindeer and the absence of castrated animals challenge the herders’ resilience coping strategies. This chapter discusses factors that constrain resilience in herding societies, contribute to the transformation of reindeer husbandry and the erosion of resilience in the herding society. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Reindeer herding is a complex, highly mobile, and environmentally adaptive form of livestock management, and a traditional way of life, practiced by indigenous peoples across the circumpolar Arctic. Given its distinctive characteristics, appropriate economic governance and regulation of the practice demands a clear understanding of its social, cultural, and environmental characteristics. In the following, we outline some of these and discuss their implications for economic management of the practice, with reference to the case of Norway in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In closing, we identify some key current threats and challenges that confront reindeer herding and present some suggestions for enhancing its economic viability and resilience, based on a strategy of revitalizing core economic and social mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Genetic diversity is a key part of biodiversity, threatened by human activities that lead to loss of gene flow and reduction of effective population sizes. Gene flow is a result of both landscape connectivity and demographic processes determining the number of dispersing individuals in space and time. Thus, the effect of human impact on processes determining the level of genetic diversity must be interpreted in the context of basic ecological conditions affecting survival and recruitment. When the intensity of human impact and habitat suitability correlate, the effect on genetic diversity and gene flow may be challenging to predict. We compared genetic diversity, gene flow and landscape resistance in two contrasting landscapes in Norway for the pond-breeding amphibian Triturus cristatus: a highly human-impacted, agricultural landscape with ecologically productive habitats, and a forested landscape with less productive habitats and lower levels of human impact. Our results show that genetic diversity was higher and gene flow lower within the forested landscape. Microclimatic moisture conditions and vegetation cover were important determinants of landscape resistance to gene flow within both landscapes. There were indications that landscape resistance was increased by minor roads in the forested landscape, which was not the case for the agricultural landscape, suggesting a higher vulnerability to human interference within the landscape matrix for the populations in less productive habitats. Our findings suggest that the effect of human impact on genetic diversity may not be straightforward but modulated by the ecological conditions underlying local demographic processes. Populations within both landscapes seem to be vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity, but due to different mechanisms. This has implications for the choice of relevant management actions, that is, increasing population stability may be more relevant within an agricultural landscape still permeable for dispersal, while conserving dispersal corridors may be more appropriate in the forested landscape, to avoid isolation and increased genetic drift. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In Norway, cattle (Bos taurus) are released to large areas of boreal forest for summer grazing. To determine to what degree this practice challenges timber production and wildlife management, we need a better understanding of basic cattle ecology. What do cattle, typical grazers, feed on in a habitat typically used by browsers? We determined cattle's resource use and selection at three scales: habitat and microhabitat selection when foraging and diet selection. Boreal forest is dominated by grass-poor habitats, and despite their strong selection for grass-rich habitats, cows spent a lot of time in suboptimal habitats, like old bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) spruce (Picea abies) forest. However, they managed to find grass-rich habitat patches within those, selecting for patches with bentgrass (Agrostis spp.). Graminoids, mainly wavy hair-grass (Avenella spp.), tussock grass (Deschampsia), and true sedges (Carex spp.), made up the biggest part of the fecal samples. Woody plants, mainly willow (Salix spp.), Vaccinium spp., pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.), made up 9.4% ± 4.7% of the samples, a value lower than reported for other forest grazing cattle. Cattle avoided woody plants in their diet and selected for graminoids. They preferred deciduous over coniferous species. At these low stocking densities, the cows were grazers in this browser's habitat. Moreover, they selected rather on habitat and patch scale than for individual plants within a given habitat patch, considered typical for a grazer. Their grass-rich diet indicates little overlap with the diet of local wild ungulates, which are mostly browsers. Their aversion of spruce and selection for graminoids and deciduous trees indicates low conflict risk for browsing damages and even a beneficial weeding effect on trees planted for timber production. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The state of sea trout in 1251 Norwegian watercourses was assessed based on a scoring system for human pressures, abundance data, and local knowledge. Over 16,000 km of rivers and lakes were available to sea trout in these watercourses, spanning from the temperate to Arctic regions. Sea trout were classified to be in a good or very good state in fewer than 25% of the watercourses and in a poor or very poor state in almost 40%. Twenty-nine watercourses had lost their sea trout populations. Salmon lice from aquaculture salmon farms had by far the largest adverse effect on sea trout among the human impact factors, both in the number of watercourses (83%) and river area affected (60%), and the total effect on sea trout abundance. Agriculture and hydropower production also had strong adverse impacts (35% and 19% of watercourses), but substantially lower than that caused by salmon lice. Culverts related to road crossings and other habitat alterations also had impacts on sea trout in many watercourses (27%). Exploitation of sea trout has been reduced in Norway in recent years, both in the marine and freshwater fisheries. Yet, the exploitation pressure was moderate or high in almost 14% of the watercourses where the state of sea trout was poor or very poor, suggesting a high potential for overexploitation in these. The state of sea trout was best in the northern sparsely populated areas. However, distribution of watercourses with sea trout in a poor or very poor state was more linked to aquaculture, agriculture, and hydropower production than human population density. The developed approach for large-scale mapping of state and pressures, which is vital for prioritizing management measures, may inspire other nations in their conservation effort for this important species. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve good status of aquatic habitats. Classification of ecological status and identifying the stressors impacting aquatic habitats is essential for achieving this aim. Here, we evaluate different methods and indices for assessing ecological status in a hydropower-regulated river in central Norway using kick-sampling and macroinvertebrate identification through morphology and DNA as well as using environmental DNA. In Norway, the ASPT index (Average Score Per Taxon) is commonly used to evaluate ecological condition in general, although the index only provides evidence for organic pollution. We observed lower than expected diversity in the regulated river, but this was not reflected in the ASPT index, which showed “Good” to “High” status for all samples and methods. An alternative index, the IBIBI (Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index), returned “Bad” to “Moderate” status using the same data. The DNA-based identification methods returned in general higher species richness and somewhat higher index values than morphological species identification did. Our study exemplifies the importance of including relevant biological quality indices in WFD compliant assessments, and we advocate inclusion of a pressure-independent index like IBIBI in Norwegian river management and DNA-based identification methods for future river management in general. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Norway launched a national action plan on wetland restoration in 2016. So far, 90% of the restoration effort has been on peatland restoration, with about 140 mires restored so far. There are three main restoration goals stated in the action plan: 1) limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, 2) climate adaptation and 3) improved ecological condition. Quantifying the outcome of the restoration actions is necessary to evaluate whether the goals of the action plan are met. A vegetation monitoring protocol was suggested before restoration started and has been implemented at five restoration sites. As the peatland restoration effort in Norway is increasing, it is timely to evaluate if the data currently collected can measure peatland restoration outcome. We evaluate the monitoring protocol based on statistical analyses of the data collected at two sites, describe how indicator species can be identified using generalized composition data used as the basis for classifying habitats in Norway (EcoSyst framework), and suggest the way forward for peatland restoration monitoring in Norway. Data collected according to the monitoring protocol can document changes in species composition at restoration sites, but has limitations when the ecological complexity at the sites increases and reference sites are unavailable. We argue that adjusting the monitoring protocol will: 1) facilitate alignment with existing peatland research; 2) connect better with monitoring programs where data is collected applying EcoSyst framework principles; and 3) enable upscaling to cover the wide variation emerging in peatland restoration. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Dense beds of aquatic plants are often perceived as nuisance and therefore mechanically removed, often at substantial cost. Such removal, however, may affect a range of ecosystem functions and consequently also the ecosystem services that benefit society. We studied five cases: River Otra (Norway), River Spree (Germany), Lake Kemnade (Germany), Lake Grand-Lieu (France) and Hartbeespoort Dam (South Africa). In all, nuisance aquatic plant growth is managed, but dominant species, geographic setting and major societal uses are different. We quantified 12 final ecosystem services as flows per area and year in biophysical and monetary terms. Quantified services were food and fodder production, commercial fisheries, hunting and gathering wild products, hydropower production, drinking and irrigation water production, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, active and passive recreation and biodiversity conservation (nonuse). These services were related to aquatic plant cover via a range of ecosystem functions, and the effects were estimated of three plant removal regimes on the relative importance of the quantified ecosystem services and on the total sum of the monetary estimates (total economic value, TEV). The three removal regimes were ‘maximum removal’, ‘current practice’ and ‘do nothing’. In all five cases, TEV was dominated by different forms of recreation. TEV was highest for Lake Kemnade, where visitor densities were highest. TEV was most sensitive to the different management regimes in Lake Kemnade, because a threshold in aesthetic appreciation was passed in the ‘do-nothing’ regime, and in Hartbeespoort Dam, because of the effect on boating and angling. In the other cases, the different removal regimes had little effect on the estimated TEV. Synthesis and applications. Since recreation dominated the estimated societal benefits in the studied ecosystems, also where provision of hydropower, drinking water or irrigation water were relevant, effects on recreation should be a core consideration in the management of nuisance aquatic plants. Furthermore, aquatic plant management strategies will benefit from taking into account the differences in perceived nuisance among different categories of recreative users before engaging in costly removal. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the production and protection of economic, social, and environmental values. To understand current challenges and trajectories shaping future strategies within the Nordic forest sector, it is important to map and trace past and present policy and governance developments. The core contribution of this short communication is to present an open-access database that compiles key forest-related public national policies, legislative documents, and private governance initiatives in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway from the 19th century to the present day. To showcase the potential use of the database, we conducted a comparative appraisal of forest governance trends across Nordic countries, outlining differences and shared characteristics. We identify a shift from a highly regulated and rationalized forest management regime in the 19th and early 20th centuries towards more flexible forms of contemporary governance. This transformation comes with the growing importance of sectorial freedom with responsibility principles, but also increasing calls for forest multifunctionality. Demands for recreation, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation have intensified pressures on forest owners to provide public goods. However, the production and processing of marketable forest resources remains important to meet circular bioeconomy strategy goals. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications for strategic multifunctional use and polycentric governance of forests. © 2023

AB  - Soil health assessments that integrate physical, chemical and biological indicators help the evaluation of soil functioning, provide a framework for monitoring soil degradation, guide land management activities and secure the delivery of soil ecosystem services. In this study, we assessed soil health by soil texture class on arable land in Southeast Norway and mid-Norway and between grassland and arable land in mid-Norway. We used descriptive statistics and the Welch t-test with unequal variance and Bonferroni corrections to compare a physical soil indicator (bulk density) and chemical indicators (organic matter, P-AL, K-AL, Ca-AL, Mg-AL, Na-AL and pH). We developed scoring curves from cumulative normal distribution functions on regional soil data for various soil indicators where climate, soil texture class and land use were considered. Our results show that for certain soil texture classes, average soil indicator values differed between pedo-climatic zones on arable land, but for others the difference was not significant. The variability between the pedo-climatic zones for these can be neglected, but for the ones that differ, the variability is important to consider when assessing soil health. Similarly, this was the case when comparing land use (grassland and arable land) for most soil indicators in mid-Norway. This finding illustrates the importance of addressing unique local conditions in soil health assessments. We propose aggregating similar soil texture classes where no differences are apparent when developing scoring curves. The sub-optimal levels of plant available nutrients (P-AL and K-AL) found in the soil in both pedo-climatic zones highlights the importance of suitable threshold values for targeted soil ecosystem services to ensure soil health and sustainable agricultural production. We also recommend prioritizing the most relevant soil ecosystem services to limit the number of soil indicators that need monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The rotation lengths of intensively managed production forests may be altered to achieve a variety of goals, with correspondingly implications for biodiversity. Here we consider the potential implications of shortened rotation times for biodiversity in planted monocultures of the two most common production tree species in Sweden, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). To do so we surveyed bird, bryophyte, epiphytic lichen and vascular plant diversity in 80 and 55-year-old stands; stand ages which approximate present-day and potential future rotation lengths in this region respectively. We found clear differences in the species communities of the 55 compared to the 80-year-old stands for both understory species and epiphytes, but not for birds. Nevertheless, bird species richness was still highest in the 80-year-old Norway spruce dominated stands. Dead wood amount was also highest the 80-year-old Norway spruce stands. Highest species richness of epiphytic lichens was found in 80-year-old Scots pine stands. However, 55-year-old Scots pine stands had a higher understory species richness and diversity than the older Scots pine stands, including a larger number of open land species. The 80-year-old forest stands examined may be considered old with respect to production forest rotation lengths in Sweden but are relatively young when comparing stand ages of unmanaged natural forest stands. Nevertheless, our results indicate that shortening the rotation time of Scots pine and Norway spruce, in this part of Sweden from 80 to 55 years, could have important consequences for forest biodiversity. These consequences are primarily inferred from the likely implications from shortened rotations for lichens community composition and diversity in both Norway spruce and Scots pine stands, as well as impacts on understory plant species in Norway spruce stands. © 2023 Petersson et al.

AB  - As demand for renewable energy is rising, wind power development is rapidly growing worldwide. In its wake, conflicts arise over land use changes converting pristine nature into industrial power plants and its associated adverse biodiversity effects, crowned by one of the most obvious and deadly consequences: bird collisions. Most post-construction studies report low levels of avian mortality, but the majority of these studies are conducted primarily on larger birds. However, the diversity and abundance of small passerine birds are rarely reflected in the carcass surveys, although they in numeric proportion to their abundances should be the most numerous. The assumption that surveys find all carcasses seems thus rarely fulfilled and passerine mortality is likely to be grossly underestimated. We therefore designed an experiment with dummy birds to estimate mortality of small-bodied passerines and other small-bodied birds during post-construction surveys, tested in a medium-sized wind farm in western Norway. The wind farm was surveyed weekly during the migration periods by carcass survey teams using trained dogs to find killed birds. The dogs in the carcass surveys were more successful in locating the large than the small dummy birds (60–200 g), where they found 74% of the large dummy birds. Detecting the smaller category (5–24 g) was more demanding and the dogs only found 17% of the small dummy birds. Correcting the post-construction carcass survey outcome with the results from the experiment leads to an almost fourfold increase in estimated mortality rates, largely due to the low detection rate of the smallest category. The detection rates will naturally vary between wind farms, depending on the specific habitat characteristics, the efficiency of the carcass surveys and the search intervals. Thus, implementing a simple experiment with dummy birds to future post-construction surveys will produce more accurate estimates of the wind turbine mortality rates, and thus improve our understanding of the biodiversity effects of conforming to a more sustainable future. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The European Union (EU) set clear climate change mitigation targets to reach climate neutrality, accounting for forests and their woody biomass resources. We investigated the consequences of increased harvest demands resulting from EU climate targets. We analysed the impacts on national policy objectives for forest ecosystem services and biodiversity through empirical forest simulation and multi-objective optimization methods. We show that key European timber-producing countries – Finland, Sweden, Germany (Bavaria) – cannot fulfil the increased harvest demands linked to the ambitious 1.5°C target. Potentials for harvest increase only exists in the studied region Norway. However, focusing on EU climate targets conflicts with several national policies and causes adverse effects on multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that the role of forests and their timber resources in achieving climate targets and societal decarbonization should not be overstated. Our study provides insight for other European countries challenged by conflicting policies and supports policymakers. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Protected areas are one of the main strategic means for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the design of protected areas usually neglects phylogenetic diversity, an important diversity measure. In this paper we assess the phylogenetic diversity and species richness of vascular plants in Fennoscandian protected areas. We evaluate how much species richness and phylogenetic diversity is found within and outside protected areas, and the differences in plant diversity between different categories of protected areas. We also assess the differences in the diversity-area relationship of the different protected area categories in terms of both species richness and phylogenetic diversity. We build a multi-locus phylogeny of 1,519 native vascular plants of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We estimate the phylogenetic diversity and species richness by combining the phylogeny with publicly available occurrence data and the currently protected area system of Fennoscandia. Our results indicate that protected areas in Fennoscandia hold more plant diversity when larger, and that phylogenetic diversity increases faster with area than species richness. We found evidence for more plant diversity outside of protected areas of the different countries of Fennoscandia than inside of protected areas, but no evidence for plant diversity differences between areas with different protection status. Hence, our results indicate that the current protected area system in Fennoscandia is no more effective in conserving phylogenetic diversity and species richness of vascular plants than a random selection of localities. Our results also indicate that planning conservation strategies around phylogenetic diversity, rather than species richness, might be a first step to protect vascular plant diversity more effectively. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - In Western Norway, farmers have traditionally used fire as a management tool in coastal heathlands to enhance the fodder quality for livestock. Rotational prescribed burning increases landscape heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different regeneration stages of heather. Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) responses to fire in traditionally managed coastal heathland have already been studied, but less is known about other beetle groups in this system. We compared the beetle activity between patches of mature and recently burnt heath, by looking at diversity indices, species composition and ecological preferences and traits. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find an increase in beta diversity after disturbance, but we found that prescribed burning offers micro-environmental conditions which enhanced the activity of sun-loving and xerophilous species. We also identified new indicator species for both mature and pioneer heath in five beetle families: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, Leiodidae, and Scirtidae. Rotational prescribed burning was confirmed to be an efficient conservation tool for specialists without affecting the overall diversity of the site. We recommend the use of several taxa, ecological preferences and traits to assess the impact of prescribed burning and to monitor the condition of traditionally managed coastal heathlands. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - After centuries of intense persecution, several large carnivore species in Europe and North America have experienced a rebound. Today's spatial configuration of large carnivore populations has likely arisen from the interplay between their ecological traits and current environmental conditions, but also from their history of persecution and protection. Yet, due to the challenge of studying population-level phenomena, we are rarely able to disentangle and quantify the influence of past and present factors driving the distribution and density of these controversial species. Using spatial capture-recapture models and a data set of 742 genetically identified wolverines Gulo gulo collected over ½ million km2 across their entire range in Norway and Sweden, we identify landscape-level factors explaining the current population density of wolverines in the Scandinavian Peninsula. Distance from the relict range along the Swedish–Norwegian border, where the wolverine population survived a long history of persecution, remains a key determinant of wolverine density today. However, regional differences in management and environmental conditions also played an important role in shaping spatial patterns in present-day wolverine density. Specifically, we found evidence of slower recolonization in areas that had set lower wolverine population goals in terms of the desired number of annual reproductions. Management of transboundary large carnivore populations at biologically relevant scales may be inhibited by administrative fragmentation. Yet, as our study shows, population-level monitoring is an achievable prerequisite for a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and density of large carnivores across an increasingly anthropogenic landscape. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Intensive forestry practices have had a negative impact on boreal forest biodiversity; as a consequence, the need for restoration is pressing. Polypores (wood-inhabiting fungi) are key decomposers of dead wood, but, due to a lack of coarse woody debris (CWD) in forest ecosystems, many species are under threat. Here, we study the long-term effects on polypore diversity of two restoration treatments: creating CWD by felling whole trees and prescribed burning. This large-scale experiment is located in spruce-dominated boreal forests in southern Finland. The experiment has a factorial design (n = 3) including three levels of created CWD (5, 30, and 60 m3 ha−1) crossed with burning or no burning. In 2018, 16 years after launching the experiment, we inventoried polypores on 10 experimentally cut logs and 10 naturally fallen logs per stand. We found that overall polypore community composition differed between burned and unburned stands. However, only red-listed species abundances and richness were positively affected by prescribed burning. We found no effects of CWD levels created mechanically by felling of trees. We show, for the first time, that prescribed burning is an effective measure for restoring polypore diversity in a late-successional Norway spruce forest. Burning creates CWD with certain characteristics that differ from what is created by CWD restoration by felling trees. Prescribed burning promotes primarily red-listed species, demonstrating its effectiveness as a restoration measure to promote diversity of threatened polypore species in boreal forests. However, because the CWD that the burning creates will decrease over time, to be functional, prescribed burns need to be applied regularly on the landscape scale. Large-scale and long-term experimental studies, such as this one, are invaluable for establishing evidence-based restoration strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Afforestation and reforestation are considered important measures for climate change mitigation. Because the land area available for tree planting may serve multiple purposes, striking the right balance between climate goals and other objectives is crucial. We conducted a survey of the Norwegian population to investigate potential land-use conflicts that may arise from executing a large-scale afforestation programme. Respondents were presented with three land-use alternatives to replace formerly grazed agricultural land. We used manipulated landscape photos to elicit their underlying value orientations. We combined multiple correspondence analysis with latent class regression models to reveal preference heterogeneity. Our models grouped respondents into three latent classes, with 24%, 24% and 52%, respectively, expressing a preference for forest carbon sequestration, recreation or agriculture as the most crucial land-use function to be retained. Birth year emerged as a strong predictor of class membership. Specifically, generations born before 1970 were more inclined to support the continuation of agricultural landscapes, while those born in 1980 and later showed a stronger inclination towards natural forest succession for carbon sequestration or recreational purposes. Quantitatively, every 10-year reduction in age increased the odds of a respondent belonging to the forestation or recreation class (relative to the agricultural class) by a factor of 2. Interestingly, even among respondents who were classified as most climate concerned, natural forests were 50% more likely to be preferred over monoculture spruce plantation as a policy option. This suggests that there may be public resistance to spruce planting for climate mitigation purposes in Norway. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Conversion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations to more diverse and resilient forest types is an important task for European forest managers in the face of climate change and increased focus on ecosystem services beyond timber production. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to cost-effectively restore such forests. This study reports the influence of vicinity (distance) of forest type (mixed or spruce), fencing and mechanical site preparation (MSP) on the early performance of planted beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedlings and natural regeneration of other tree species following clear-cuts of Norway spruce in southern Sweden. After 6 years, we found clear effects of fencing and MSP, but not of vicinity of forest type. Fencing had a positive effect on height growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) but not on height of planted beech and naturally regenerated birch (Betula pendula, B. pubescens). There was a positive effect of MSP on survival and height growth of planted beech, and on the amount of natural regeneration of Scots pine. We conclude that establishment of beech forest is greatly accelerated by active regeneration approaches such as planting. In addition, the combination of planting beech, natural regeneration of other species, fencing and MSP is effective to promote the transition to mixed and diverse stands with both broadleaves and conifers. Fencing represented the highest cost among the treatments, and its cost-effectiveness depends on the local ungulate browsing pressure. In our study, fencing was critical to protect natural regeneration of Scots pine from browsing. Finally, natural regeneration of birch was abundant in our study and relatively unaffected by fencing and MSP treatments. With time, pre-commercial thinning of the naturally regenerated birch will be needed to maintain a diverse mixture of tree species. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - It is often suggested to release oaks (Quercus robur) from competition, to ensure their survival and boost their conservational value. However, few studies have explored how long-lasting this effect is and how it affects saproxylic beetles. Ten years after cutting, we investigated effects of different release cutting levels (high, medium, and no release) around 140-year-old retained oaks in a commercial forest with Norway spruce (Picea abies). We evaluated oak vitality using crown and dead wood measurements. Saproxylic beetles were caught in window traps, identified to species level, and grouped according to their association with oak and/or Norway spruce. Released oaks had more light, higher temperatures, greater crown growth, and less dead wood in the crown compared to the no-release control. After 10 years we still found a higher abundance of oak-associated beetles and higher overall species richness of saproxylic beetles in the released oaks. Beetle species composition significantly differed between released oaks and control. We suggest avoiding planting trees beneath retained oaks when regenerating conifer forests and to proceed with conservation management during subsequent thinning by removing regeneration under the oak crowns. We emphasize the benefits of monitoring the retained oaks to maintain tree vitality, habitat quality, and insolation. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change is posing new challenges to forestry management practices. Thinning reduces competitive pressure in the forest by repeatedly reducing the tree density of forest stands, thereby increasing the productivity of plantations. Considering the impact of thinning on vegetation and physiological and ecological traits, for this study, we used Norway spruce (Picea abies) data from three sites in the PROFOUND dataset to parameterize the 3-PG model in stages. The calibrated 3-PG model was used to simulate the stand diameter at breast height and the stem, root, and leaf biomass data on a monthly scale. The 3PG-MT-LSTM model uses 3-PG simulation data as the input variable. The model uses a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) as a shared layer and introduces multi-task learning (MTL). Based on the compatibility rules, the interpretability of the model was further improved. The models were trained using single-site and multi-site data, respectively, and multiple indicators were used to evaluate the model accuracy and generalization ability. Our preliminary results show that, compared with the process model and LSTM algorithm without MTL and compatibility rules, the hybrid model has higher biomass simulation accuracy and shows a more realistic biomass response to environmental driving factors. To illustrate the potential applicability of the model, we applied light (10%), moderate (20%), and heavy thinning (30%) at intervals of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years. Then, we used three climate scenarios—SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5—to simulate the growth of Norway spruce. The hybrid model can effectively capture the impact of climate change and artificial management on stand growth. In terms of climate, temperature and solar radiation are the most important factors affecting forest growth, and under warm conditions, the positive significance of forest management is more obvious. In terms of forest management practices, less frequent light-to-moderate thinning can contribute more to the increase in forest carbon sink potential; high-intensity thinning can support large-diameter timber production. In summary, moderate thinning should be carried out every 10 years in the young-aged forest stage. It is also advisable to perform light thinning procedures after the forest has progressed into a middle-aged forest stage. This allows for a better trade-off of the growth relationship between stand yield and diameter at breast height (DBH). The physical constraint-based hybrid modeling approach is a practical and effective tool. It can be used to measure long-term dynamic changes in forest production and then guide management activities such as thinning to achieve sustainable forest management. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - An ongoing loss of Europe's old-growth forests urgently calls for improving our understanding of native biodiversity response to habitat changes. Studies disentangling the effects of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on species diversity are rare, however, understanding the differences between these effects is crucial for forest management and conservation efforts. Here, we investigated the influence of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on the total and red-listed species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) forest in Central Europe. The fruitbody-based mycological survey conducted on permanent plots was combined with the measurements of forest structural characteristics such as deadwood volumes (indicating habitat quantity), dimensions, and decay stages (indicating habitat quality). Additionally, precise dendrochronological measurements were used to estimate the mean age of five oldest trees and the number of >250 years-old-trees (i.e., those that survived a probable logging activity about 250 years ago) as indicators of habitat continuity. Our results showed the total species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi to be best correlated with habitat quantity (volume of low snags and lying deadwood), while the red-listed species richness was best explained by habitat continuity indicated by the number of >250 years-old-trees. Our study provides novel evidence regarding uninterrupted habitat continuity being crucial in supporting red-listed fungal species. Stands with preserved habitat continuity (e.g., the absence of clearcutting and deforestation) as well as old-growth stands with long habitat history should be prioritised for conservation. Greater degree of retention forestry practices should be required in production forests to preserve habitat continuity. Our study shows that such decisions are likely to lead to positive effects that can persist for centuries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) is a large herbivore that can mediate boreal forest regeneration after timber harvest through selective browsing of tree species. Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity. © 2023.

AB  - Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of species distributions is necessary for biodiversity conservation land-use planning decisions. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 ± 0.03; average ± standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 ± 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 ± 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 ± 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 ± 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 ± 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 ± 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding changes of ecosystem services and their influencing factors is crucial for more sustainable ecosystem management and conservation of nature contributions to people, especially in regions suffering high pressure from climate change and human activities, such as the Nordic countries. In this study, we assess multiple ecosystem services and their influencing factors in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. We analyze changes in ecosystem services such as habitat quality, sediment retention, water yield, carbon sequestration, crop and roundwood production between 2003 and 2018. The relationships between ecosystem services and the main influencing factors (temperature, precipitation, elevation, population, livestock, and land use change) are assessed by means of the Spearman's correlation coefficient and a new method that unravels synergies or tradeoffs at a grid level. Given the importance of forest management in the study region, an advanced land cover dataset that includes maps of forest harvest is produced and used as a basis for the analysis. Results show the large changes in ecosystem services during the study period and their spatial variations. Overall, the habitat quality is decreased, especially in the sites affected by forest management and agricultural production. Water yield and sediment retention increased due to higher precipitation (mainly in Norway). Higher temperature and forest management have generally increased carbon sequestration and provisioning services. The relationship between ecosystem services and their potential influencing factors differs across space. There are 10 out of 15 pairs of ecosystem services that predominantly show a tradeoff relationship, while the rest shows a synergy. In general, our results show the importance to monitor ecosystem services and understand the main drivers of their changes, so to design more sustainable resource management strategies that can secure a long-term delivery of ecosystem services. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - To mitigate climate change, several European countries have launched policies to promote the development of a renewable resource-based bioeconomy. These bioeconomy strategies plan to use renewable biological resources, which will increase timber and biomass demands and will potentially conflict with multiple other ecosystem services provided by forests. In addition, these forest ecosystem services (FES) are also influenced by other, different, policy strategies, causing a potential mismatch in proposed management solutions for achieving the different policy goals. We evaluated how Norwegian forests can meet the projected wood and biomass demands from the international market for achieving mitigation targets and at the same time meet nationally determined targets for other FES. Using data from the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) we simulated the development of Norwegian forests under different management regimes and defined different forest policy scenarios, according to the most relevant forest policies in Norway: national forest policy (NFS), biodiversity policy (BIOS), and bioeconomy policy (BIES). Finally, through multi-objective optimization, we identified the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario. The results for all scenarios indicated that Norway will be able to satisfy wood demands of up to 17 million m3 in 2093. However, the policy objectives for FES under each scenario caused substantial differences in terms of the management regimes selected. We observed that BIES and NFS resulted in very similar forest management programs in Norway, with a dominance of extensive management regimes. In BIOS there was an increase of set aside areas and continuous cover forestry, which made it more compatible with biodiversity indicators. We also found multiple synergies and trade-offs between the FES, likely influenced by the definition of the policy targets at the national scale. © 2022

AB  - Urban green infrastructure can provide important habitats for pollinators and support urban ecosystem services. Therefore, these areas must be managed to maximize biodiversity and density of pollinating insects. We used DNA metabarcoding to study honeybee pollen resource use over time and space in the city of Oslo, Norway, and to assess the role of green infrastructure as a resource for pollinators and the services they generate. Urban honeybees used diverse pollen resources throughout their active season. There was considerable seasonal turnover in pollen resource use that reflected flowering phenology. Non-native plants (including invasive species) were an important resource early in the season but were replaced by native plants later in the season. Hive location was not strongly correlated with resource use, likely indicating effective long-distance foraging in the fragmented urban landscape. However, flower visitation rates and floral resource density in public urban green spaces were coupled to pollen use. Honeybees collected pollen from a small number of preferred species but also visited other species, likely for nectar. To preserve pollinator services, urban planning should consider flower resource management, with particular focus on planting native species that can act as early season resources for bees. Public campaigns and other incentive mechanisms to promote the cultivation of native plants that are resources for pollinators and the protection of urban semi-natural habitats have the potential to enhance the value of green infrastructure to support urban pollinators and pollination services. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The ongoing loss of red-listed coastal heathlands is a threat to biodiversity and cultural heritage legacies throughout the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. ‘passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Competing land use and climate change are threats to the pasture land of Sámi reindeer herding. Reindeer pastures are exposed to the development of infrastructure, hydropower, mineral exploration, recreational cabin areas, and wind power. Land use conflicts are exacerbated under climate policy with wind power plants in reindeer herding areas. Projected developments and climate change impacts challenge the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders and the resilience of reindeer herding. Analysis of biodiversity loss by the GLOBIO3 model is suggested as tool for decision support, in consultation with Sámi reindeer owners, taking into account traditional knowledge of reindeer herding. GLOBIO3 analysis for Sámi reindeer herding land in Finnmark indicates that in 2011, compared to an intact situation, about 50% of the biodiversity of reindeer calving grounds has been lost, and it is expected to be reduced with another 10% in the scenario for 2030. Reindeer owners in Finnmark told that they expect biodiversity loss will have implications for the quality and extent of suitable grazing areas. Especially the quality of the calving grounds is essential for reindeer herding. An important lesson from dialogue with reindeer owners is that even highly impacted areas should not be considered as lost, and thus be opened to further development, as they are still important for seasonal reindeer migration and grazing at certain times of the year. The chapter presents research on methods development, traditional knowledge in the context of Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark and highlights innovative tools to engage rightsholders and stakeholders in the Arctic in development planning processes. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Key message: Bird assemblages in planted spruce (Picea abies L.) forests were compositionally distinct from those in naturally regenerated mixed stands. Despite rapid stand development on productive soils, even-aged silviculture cannot host most old-forest species. However, their habitat quality could be supported in landscape mosaics with retention forestry and set-asides. Context: The most productive forest lands have naturally the richest bird assemblages but tend to be also most intensively managed. Sustainable solutions to this conflict are unclear. Aim: To assess bird assemblages and their successional dynamics in planted Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands compared to naturally developing stands. Methods: We mapped breeding bird assemblages in forty 5-ha plots on highly productive soils in Estonia. The plots included sets of naturally regenerated and planted stands, and (as successional endpoints) clear-cuts and old stands. Results: Planted stands had fewer bird species and pairs than naturally regenerated stands; the latter having a species composition resembling late-successional deciduous-dominated stands. Importantly, the species composition in mature spruce plantations converged toward the composition observed in late-successional conifer-dominated stands. Downed dead wood, stand age, deciduous trees, and stock density were the most significant stand characteristics shaping bird assemblages. Conclusion: The habitat value of established spruce plantations can be primarily improved by allowing for some deciduous trees and gaps with deciduous undergrowth. At the landscape scale, the bird diversity of even-aged systems would be enhanced by multi-scale applications of retention forestry—from retention trees to old-growth set-asides. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Reindeer meat, traditional food and knowledge are vital for the culture, health, and economy of Sámi reindeer herders. Nevertheless, the practices of reindeer meat smoking have barely been part of scientific research or reindeer herding management. We investigated Sámi reindeer herders’ approach to meat smoking in Northern Norway performed in the traditional Sámi tent, the lávvu. The investigation included workshops, interviews, participatory observations, and co-analyze meetings. Our findings reveal a typology of the traditional Sámi smoking practices. Sámi reindeer herders use a variety of wood species and plant parts to control the smoke based on a complex system of traditional knowledge. Yet there is a need for education, industry, and research acknowledging, supporting, and maintaining the Sámi meat-smoking process and associated worldviews, knowledge, and practices to ensure ethical, sustainable, and healthy food production. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The epiphytic lichen species richness and community composition was compared for 600 living trees distributed within the interior of 60 Scots pine and Norway spruce monoculture stands in southern Sweden. A higher species richness, and more unique species, was found on trees of Scots pine than of Norway spruce, and distinctive communities were associated with the two tree species. Lichen species composition also shifted between the 30-, 55- and 80-year-old stands, although there was no significant difference in species richness between the different age classes. Tree species and age of the stand explained most of the variation in community composition (41%), with additional variance explained by lichen proximity to the ground (6%) and aspect (1%) (northern/southern side of trunk). Scots pine and Norway spruce share many attributes, such as both being conifers with acidic bark properties and having a similar geographical distribution in Fennoscandia. However, our study showed that species richness and community composition can nevertheless diverge in stands dominated by these two tree species. Since the occurrence of red-listed species was low in these stands, we suggest that 80-year rotations are not long enough for the occurrence of the many rare and specialized lichen species that require old forest structures and long forest continuity in this region.

AB  - Aims: The area influenced by road construction is large, and measures to re-establish vegetation in disturbed areas are routinely carried out to reduce impacts on biodiversity. However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location: Highways in southeast Norway. Methods: We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results: Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions: It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Strong anthropogenic pressures on global forests necessitate that managed forests be evaluated as habitat for biodiversity. The complex pattern of habitat types created in forestry systems is ideal for analyses through the theoretical framework of alpha (local), gamma (total) and beta (compositional) diversity. Here I use saproxylic beetles, a species-rich threatened group, to compare four Norway spruce-dominated habitats representative of the boreal forest landscape of northern Europe: unmanaged semi-natural stands, nature reserves, unthinned middle-aged production stands and commercially thinned production stands. The beetles (in total 38 085 individuals of 312 species), including red-listed ones and three feeding guilds (wood consumers, fungivores and predators) were studied in 53 stands in central-southern Sweden, in two regions with differing amounts of conservation forest. Alpha diversity of saproxylic, but not red-listed, beetles was higher in the thinned stands than in the semi-natural stands, and did not differ for the other forest types. Beta diversity of saproxylic beetles was higher in unmanaged semi-natural stands than in the other forest types, but species composition did not differ noticeably. Furthermore, red-listed saproxylic beetles had higher gamma diversity in unmanaged semi-natural stands in the region with more conservation forest, but not in the one with less such forest. The local factors dead wood volume and dead wood diversity did not influence alpha diversity of beetles, but increasing canopy openness had a minor negative influence on saproxylic and red-listed beetles. While the local scale (alpha diversity) indicates the potential for managed forests to house many saproxylic beetle species associated with spruce forests in this boreal landscape, the larger scales (beta and gamma diversity) indicate the value of unmanaged forests for the conservation of the entire saproxylic beetle fauna. These results show the importance of analyses at multiple levels of diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) for identifying patterns relevant to conservation. © 2022 Oskar Gran.

AB  - Traditionally, biogeography has described the distribution of species. But as plant functional traits and functional diversity underpin ecosystem dynamics, understanding drivers of functional diversity at biogeographical scales is essential to understand spatial variation in ecosystem characteristics, particularly in light of ongoing environmental changes. Here we investigate geographic patterns of functional diversity and -traits of the Norwegian flora. We explore whether climate, land-use or glacial history are important drivers of functional diversity. We combine species occurrence records and assemblage-means of functional traits to assess the spatial distribution of functional traits and -diversity of native vascular plants in Norway in a 20 × 20 km grid. We use multiple-model inference to identify which environmental factors contribute the most in explaining the spatial patterns of trait distributions and functional diversity. Additionally, we use the constructed models to predict potential changes in distributions of traits and functional diversity given different climate change scenarios. Both individual traits and functional diversity display clear geographic patterns, predictable by climate, landscape and glacial history. Traits related to plant size and growth peak in warmer areas and are predicted to increase in the future, as is functional richness and dispersion. In contrast, functional evenness peaks in northern regions and is predicted to decrease in the future. The different environmental drivers vary in degree of importance, effect sizes and -directions on the assemblage-averaged functional traits and -diversity. This underlines the importance of multiple drivers in determining plant assemblage functionality. In the face of climate- and land-use change, Norway is expected to become warmer, wetter and experience a substantial increase in anthropogenic land-uses, such as increased urbanisation. In turn, the functional composition of the Norwegian flora is predicted to shift towards tall, woody, fast-growing species. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Planting new forests has received scientific and political attention as a measure to mitigate climate change. Large, new forests have been planted in places like China and Ethiopia and, over time, a billion hectares could become available globally for planting new forests. Sustainable management of forests, which are available to wood production, has received less attention despite these forests covering at least two billion hectares globally. Better management of existing forests would improve forest growth and help mitigate climate change by increasing the forest carbon (C) stock, by storing C in forest products, and by generating wood-based materials substituting fossil C based materials or other CO2-emission-intensive materials. Some published research assumes a trade-off between the timber harvested from existing forests and the stock of C in those forest ecosystems, asserting that both cannot increase simultaneously. We tested this assumption using the uniquely detailed forest inventory data available from Finland, Norway and Sweden, hereafter denoted northern Europe. We focused on the period 1960 – 2017, that saw little change in the total area covered by forests in northern Europe. At the start of the period, rotational forestry practices began to diffuse, eventually replacing selective felling management systems as the most common management practice. Looking at data over the period we find that despite significant increases in timber and pulp wood harvests, the growth of the forest C stock accelerated. Over the study period, the C stock of the forest ecosystems in northern Europe increased by nearly 70%, while annual timber harvests increased at the about 40% over the same period. This increase in the forest C stock was close to on par with the CO2-emissions from the region (other greenhouse gases not included). Our results suggest that the important effects of management on forest growth allows the forest C stock and timber harvests to increase simultaneously. The development in northern Europe raises the question of how better forest management can improve forest growth elsewhere around the globe while at the same time protecting biodiversity and preserving landscapes. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Thin, hair-like lichens (Alectoria, Bryoria, Usnea) form conspicuous epiphyte communities across the boreal biome. These poikilohydric organisms provide important ecosystem functions and are useful indicators of global change. We analyse how environmental drivers influence changes in occurrence and length of these lichens on Norway spruce (Picea abies) over 10 years in managed forests in Sweden using data from >6000 trees. Alectoria and Usnea showed strong declines in southern-central regions, whereas Bryoria declined in northern regions. Overall, relative loss rates across the country ranged from 1.7% per year in Alectoria to 0.5% in Bryoria. These losses contrasted with increased length of Bryoria and Usnea in some regions. Occurrence trajectories (extinction, colonization, presence, absence) on remeasured trees correlated best with temperature, rain, nitrogen deposition, and stand age in multinomial logistic regression models. Our analysis strongly suggests that industrial forestry, in combination with nitrogen, is the main driver of lichen declines. Logging of forests with long continuity of tree cover, short rotation cycles, substrate limitation and low light in dense forests are harmful for lichens. Nitrogen deposition has decreased but is apparently still sufficiently high to prevent recovery. Warming correlated with occurrence trajectories of Alectoria and Bryoria, likely by altering hydration regimes and increasing respiration during autumn/winter. The large-scale lichen decline on an important host has cascading effects on biodiversity and function of boreal forest canopies. Forest management must apply a broad spectrum of methods, including uneven-aged continuous cover forestry and retention of large patches, to secure the ecosystem functions of these important canopy components under future climates. Our findings highlight interactions among drivers of lichen decline (forestry, nitrogen, climate), functional traits (dispersal, lichen colour, sensitivity to nitrogen, water storage), and population processes (extinction/colonization). © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Riparian forest buffers have multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services in both freshwater and terrestrial habitats but are rarely implemented in water ecosystem management, partly reflecting the lack of information on the effectiveness of this measure. In this context, social learning is valuable to inform stakeholders of the efficacy of riparian vegetation in mitigating stream degradation. We aim to develop a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for application as a learning tool to simulate and assess the reach- and segment-scale effects of riparian vegetation properties and land use on instream invertebrates. We surveyed reach-scale riparian conditions, extracted segment-scale riparian and subcatchment land use information from geographic information system data, and collected macroinvertebrate samples from four catchments in Europe (Belgium, Norway, Romania, and Sweden). We modelled the ecological condition based on the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index, a macroinvertebrate-based index widely used in European bioassessment, as a function of different riparian variables using the BBN modelling approach. The results of the model simulations provided insights into the usefulness of riparian vegetation attributes in enhancing the ecological condition, with reach-scale riparian vegetation quality associated with the strongest improvements in ecological status. Specifically, reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 3 (i.e. moderate quality) generally results in the highest probability of a good ASPT score (99–100%). In contrast, a site with a narrow width of riparian trees and a small area of trees with reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 1 (i.e. low quality) predicts a high probability of a bad ASPT score (74%). The strengths of the BBN model are the ease of interpretation, fast simulation, ability to explicitly indicate uncertainty in model outcomes, and interactivity. These merits point to the potential use of the BBN model in workshop activities to stimulate key learning processes that help inform the management of riparian zones. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Coordinating and implementing ecosystem restoration projects can be challenging when the professions involved have differing perceptions of ecological restoration and implementation in practice. To overcome these barriers in complex restoration projects, we suggest analysing ecosystem restoration as a boundary object, a concept drawn from the field of science and technology studies. We use a large scale restoration project in the Dovre Mountains of Norway to demonstrate the validity of using the boundary object concept in this context. The restoration involves a former military training area where the goal of the project was to protect and restore the environment and allow for civilian use. We examine how the different professions developed sufficient mutual understanding to make the project work. In particular, we explore the extent to which the perceptions of different professions overlap, the diversity of the perceptions in the project and how this might influence the outcome of the restoration. The boundary object concept offers potential to help improve restoration quality and reduce conflicts. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Genetic enhancement of tree species is integral to global forest management practices with mass propagation of enhanced plant material being used to reforest whole landscapes. It is unclear, however, how genetic enhancement of basic traits such as tree growth may influence the function of life supporting soil ecosystems. We studied the potential cascading effects of genetic increases in growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) on a range of soil chemical and biological properties. Because this species is a prime candidate for the genetic enhancement of boreal forest landscapes and it has been introduced around the world, its impacts on soil microbiomes are likely of importance both locally and globally. In a 40-year common garden, we assessed how genetic increases in growth generated through controlled crossing of high-quality “plus” trees from across the central boreal zone of Sweden influenced a range of soil properties beneath the canopies. Properties included pH, carbon, nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, respiration rate, and the composition of microbial communities assessed via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). We found that Norway spruce family significantly affected each of the seven chemical properties assessed, with differences of up to 140% among families, and that three of the seven were significantly correlated with mean family growth rate. We also found that fungal PLFAs varied significantly across Norway spruce families, but these differences were not strongly related to mean family growth rate. This study, representing just one cycle of selective breeding, suggests that genetic increases in tree growth rates may also be inadvertently altering soil communities and ecosystem services. Such alterations across forest landscapes may have unexpected implications for the function of forest ecosystems (i.e., nutrient cycling) as well as processes of global significance (i.e., carbon sequestration). © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: Grasslands of varying land-use intensity and history were studied to describe and test species richness and compositional patterns and their relationships with the physical environment, land cover of the surrounding landscape, patch geometry, and grazing. Location: The mainland of Norway. Methods: We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results: Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness. The importance of land use and land-cover composition should be considered when planning management actions in extensively used high-latitude grasslands. © 2022 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Wild bees are key ecosystem components making their decline a cause for concern. An effective measure to increase wild bee diversity is to enhance plant diversity. However, the effect on bee diversity of augmenting plant diversity depends on site-specific environmental conditions. We aimed to make spatial predictions of where: (a) environmental conditions maximize bee diversity, so that such areas can be prioritized for augmenting plant diversity; and (b) populations of threatened wild bee species are most likely to occur. We surveyed bee communities in traditionally managed hay meadows in SE Norway and modelled bee diversity as a function of climate, habitat area, and distance to nesting substrates. We used independent data to validate our predictions and found that plant and predicted bee species richness together explained 76% and 69% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness in forested and agricultural ecosystems, respectively. In urban areas, the predicted bee species richness alone explained 31% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness. Using data from online species occurrence records, we found that – compared to species of lower conservation concern – threatened solitary bee species were more typically recorded in areas with a high predicted solitary bee species richness. We show that spatial predictions of bee diversity can identify sites where augmenting plant diversity is likely to be most effective. Maps of predicted bee diversity can guide species surveys and monitoring projects and increase the chances of locating populations of threatened bees. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11–25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6–10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Remediation of groundwater from landfill contamination presents a serious challenge due to the complex mixture of contaminants discharged from landfills. Here, we show the significance of a nature-based solution to a landfill-contaminated aquifer in southeast Norway. Groundwater physicochemical parameters monitored for twenty-eight years were used as a proxy to infer natural remediation. Results show that concentrations of the major chemical variables decreased with time and distance until they tailed off. An exception to this was sulphate, which showed an increase, but apparently, exhibits a stationary phase. The water types were found to be most similar between samples from active landfill and post-closure stages, while samples from the stabilised stage showed a different water type. All the chemical parameters of samples from the stabilised stage were found to be within the Norwegian drinking water standards, except iron and manganese, which were only marginally above the limits, an indication of a possible recovery of this aquifer. The findings highlight the significance of natural attenuation processes in remediating contaminated aquifers and have significant consequences for future contamination management, where natural remediation can be viewed as an alternative worth exploring. This is promising in the wake of calls for sustainable remediation management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Global forests are the main component of the land carbon sink, which acts as a partial buffer to CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Dynamic vegetation models offer an approach to projecting the development of forest carbon sink capacity in a future climate. Forest management capabilities are important to include in dynamic vegetation models to account for the effects of age and species structure and wood harvest on carbon stocks and carbon storage potential. This article describes the implementation of a forest management module containing even-age and clear-cut and uneven-age and continuous-cover management alternatives in the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Different age and species structure initialisation strategies and harvest alternatives are introduced. The model is applied at stand and European scales. Different management alternatives are applied in simulations of European beech (Fagus sylvaticus) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) even-aged monoculture stands in central Europe and evaluated against above-ground standing stem volume and harvested volume data from long-term experimental plots. At the European scale, an automated thinning and clear-cut strategy is applied. Modelled carbon stocks and fluxes are evaluated against reported data at the continent and country levels. Including wood harvest in regrowth forests increases the simulated total European carbon sink by 32g% in 1991-2015 and improves the fit to the reported European carbon sink, growing stock, and net annual increment (NAI). Growing stock (156gm3gha-1) and NAI (5.4gm3gha1gyr1) densities in 2010 are close to reported values, while the carbon sink density in 2000-2007 (0.085gkggCgm-2gyr1) equates to 63g% of reported values, most likely reflecting uncertainties in carbon fluxes from soil given the unaccounted for forest land-use history in the simulations. The fit of modelled and reported values for individual European countries varies, but NAI is generally closer to reported values when including wood harvest in simulations. © Copyright:

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst. (L.)) in the boreal zone can be managed as even-aged or uneven-aged stands, or be grown with no management at all. Here, we investigated how these management options affect carbon dynamics, particularly the carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem (trees and soil), and albedo, and their combined effect on radiative forcing compared to a reference case, clear-cut site before planting seedlings. This allowed us to assess the potential of different management regimes to mitigate global warming. We ran long-term simulations under the current climate on a sub-mesic site in central Finland (62oN) using an eco-physiological forest-ecosystem model. Compared to even-aged management, no management (old-growth forest) increased ecosystem carbon stocks by 47 per cent and decreased albedo by 15 per cent, whereas uneven-aged management reduced ecosystem carbon stocks by 16 per cent and increased albedo by 10 per cent. Only the no management option resulted in a significant net cooling effect whereas for even-aged and uneven-aged management, the opposing effects of changes in albedo and carbon stocks largely cancelled each other with little remaining net effect. On the other hand, the latter one even made a small net warming contribution. Overall, maintaining higher ecosystem carbon stocks implied the larger cooling benefits. This was evident even though lower albedo enhanced radiation absorption, and thus warming. Increasing use of the no management option by forest owners may require proper incentives such as compensation for lost harvest incomes.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - While wind energy remains a preferred source of renewable energy, understanding the full spectrum of impacts are vital to balance climate-related benefits against their costs to biodiversity. Environmental impact assessments often fail to assess cumulative effects at larger spatial scales. In this respect, life cycle assessments are better suited, but have to date mainly focused on greenhouse gas emissions and energy accounting. Here, we adapt a recent global life-cycle impact assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate collision, disturbance and habitat loss impacts of onshore wind energy development on bird species richness in Norway. The advantage of a local model for Norway is that it enables employing species distribution models to more accurately estimate the potential distribution area of species. This facilitates more realistic site- and species-specific assessments of potential impacts within a local scale but excludes habitat ranges outside Norway. Furthermore, a new characterization factor was developed for potential barrier effects. Larger onshore wind-power plants overall had greater site-specific potentially disappeared fractions (PDF) of species, while smaller plants were less efficiently located with greater impacts per GWh. Overall, Norwegian wind-power plants were sited least efficiently (PDF/GWh) regarding indirect habitat loss (2.186 × 10−9) and disturbance (1.219 × 10−9), followed by direct habitat loss (0.932 × 10−9), and finally collisions (0.040 × 10−9) and barriers (0.310 × 10−9). Vulnerability differed among bird groups with seabirds, raptors and waterfowl emerging as the most impacted groups (e.g. 5.143 × 10−9, 3.409 × 10−9 and 3.139 × 10−9 PDF/GWh for disturbance, respectively); highlighting the sympatric distribution of their habitats and the majority of Norway's onshore wind-power plants. Current practice has not succeeded in avoiding sites with higher impacts for birds, fuelling conflicts surrounding environmental concerns of onshore wind energy development in Norway. Operative LCA models can help decision-makers assessing localized life-cycle environmental impacts to support environmental-friendly wind energy production in specific regions. © 2021

AB  - Background: Solo—being intentionally solitary in nature—is receiving growing attention as a valuable outdoor education program component. Its practice and history have been researched in the context of experiential learning, but few studies have explicitly examined how solo experiences can affect dimensions of well-being. This study investigated a broad range of well-being pathways provided by being solo, based on data from Norway, Germany, and New Zealand. Methods: Using qualitative content analysis (QCA), the solo debrief responses of 40 participants (26 females, age: 19–64 years) were analysed, applying the PERMA-V framework (emotions, engagement, relationship, meaning, achievement, and vitality). Variations in the reports were explored as a function of the national sample, gender, age, prior solo experiences and expectations. Results: The study suggests that hedonic and eudemonic well-being pathways, represented by the six PERMA-V pillars, interrelate strongly. The experience of a range of positive emotions and connecting process during solo highlights two of the most frequent findings related to well-being pathways. The secondary findings suggest minor variations in the well-being pathways for the different national samples, gender and age. Expectations and prior experiences with solo were identified as context factors with minor impact. Further, the data-driven analysis identified specific physical activities, landscape features, sense-activation, perception of time and ‘good’ weather as relevant to the specific experience. Conclusions: Solo experiences provide for well-being-related pathways in a multitude of ways, which highlights the well-being potential of solo implementation across practical fields beyond outdoor education, such as wilderness therapy, and environmental and planetary health initiatives. Future studies should continue to explore solo’s well-being potential in different settings, especially in the context of non-Western samples. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing the prevalence of broadleaf trees in conifer-dominated production forests is a recommended means of improving habitat availability for broadleaf and mixed-forest species. The implications for biodiversity are often measured by contrasting broadleaf-conifer mixtures with conifer-dominated stands. However, few studies include broadleaf-dominated stands in these assessments. Here we contrasted the bird assemblages of even-aged production forests along a mixture gradient from Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated, to birch (Betula spp.) dominated stands in southern Sweden. We conducted point count surveys of bird individuals exhibiting breeding behaviour within 30 stands varying from <0.5% to over 98.5% broadleaf by basal area. A total of 355 birds were detected, comprising 36 bird species, seven of which are classified as near threatened by the Swedish Red-list. Our results indicate i) a distinct shift in bird community composition linked to the percentage of broadleaf trees at stand and landscape scales, ii) significantly higher bird species richness, evenness, and abundance in stands with a higher proportion of birch, iii) higher bird abundance in birch-dominated stands than in mixtures, and iv) shifts in bird species guilds as related to stand basal area, the amount of shrubs in the understory, and quantities of dead wood. All of these results have implications for the ways in which production forest management could be altered to enhance avian diversity, and we discuss these with respect to the use of broadleaf versus mixed-species stands. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Bryophytes and lichens are two main components of the forest floor vegetation. They provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient recycling and water regulation. Here, we contrast the species richness, cover and community composition of forest floor bryophytes and lichens in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated production forests. The study sites were located in the hemiboreal zone of southern Sweden, and represented early-, mid- and late rotation stands. Our aim was to examine the potential consequences for forest floor biodiversity from the decreasing use of Scots pine production forests in this region. Whereas Scots pine and Norway spruce stands did not differ in bryophyte cover, we found a higher cover of lichens in Scots pine stands, and highest in the intermediate aged stands. Also the species richness of lichens was higher in the Scots pine stands, while bryophyte species richness was higher in the Norway spruce stands. Differences in canopy cover and associated light transmittance to the forest floor appears to be important drivers for distinctive different forest floor communities in the Scots pine and Norway spruce stands, as revealed by Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Mean Ellenberg indicator values for bryophytes and lichens showed that species associated with Scots pine stands were characterized by their tolerance of brighter conditions, higher insolation, and better adaptation to a continental climate. Norway spruce stands instead had a comparably larger proportion of species tolerating lower light, but also indicators of higher available nutrient levels, humidity, and pH. The outcome of the Ellenberg indicator species analysis, as well as the larger cover of lichens,and adaptations to drought found among some mosses, revealed that forest floor communities are shaped by different environmental factors in Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. These environmental differences, and the quantified shifts in forest floor communities identified in this study, indicate the large shifts in understory bryophyte and lichen species composition and abundance that is likely to occur if Scots pine stands are converted to Norway spruce. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Functional traits are linked to ecosystem processes and services and therefore relevant in recovery assessment. However, traits of bryophytes and lichens, important components of many ecosystems, have received less attention than those of vascular plants. We explored the use of functional traits of multiple important organism groups in recovery assessment. We combined data on traits and species composition for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens from four alpine spoil heaps and their undisturbed surroundings in western Norway, collected at three time-points spanning more than two decades. We studied changes in community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values and distribution of trait-category optima over time. We analyzed temporal variation in joint functional trait composition using the ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) to predict time to recovery. We observed functional shifts along the successional gradient for all organism groups, e.g. from wind-dispersed propagules shortly after disturbance to vegetative reproduction at later successional stages. Over time, the similarity between dispersal-related traits of vascular plants and bryophytes on the spoil heaps and in their surroundings increased, indicating that propagule influx is important in alpine restoration. The joint functional trait composition of all spoil heaps converged towards that of their surroundings: one spoil heap had recovered 34 years after construction, while the predicted time to recovery for the other three was 59–74 years. Our results indicate that inclusion of multiple organism groups improves trait-based recovery assessments and time-to-recovery predictions. Further development of trait databases is essential for future use of joint functional trait composition in recovery assessment. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - There is a rivalry between policies on intensification of forest management to meet the demands of a growing bioeconomy, and policies on green infrastructure functionality. Evaluation of the net effects of different policy instruments on real-world outcomes is crucial. First, we present data on final felling rates in wood production landscapes and stand age distribution dynamic in two case study regions, and changes in dead wood amounts in Sweden. Second, the growth of formally protected areas was compiled and changes in functional connectivity analysed in these regions, and the development of dead wood and green tree retention in Sweden was described. The case studies were the counties Dalarna and Jämtland (77,000 km2 ) representing an expanding frontier of boreal forest transformation. In the wood production landscape, official final felling rates averaged 0.84%/year, extending the regional timber frontier. The amount of forest <60 years old increased from 27–34% in 1955 to 60–65% in 2017. The amounts of dead wood, a key forest naturalness indicator, declined from 1994 to 2016 in north Sweden, and increased in the south, albeit both at levels far below evidence-based biodiversity targets. Formal forest protection grew rapidly in the two counties from 1968 to 2020 but reached only 4% of productive forests. From 2000 to 2019, habitat network functionality for old Scots pine declined by 15–41%, and Norway spruce by 15–88%. There were mixed trends for dead wood and tree retention at the stand scale. The net result of the continued transformation of near-natural forest remnants and conservation efforts was negative at the regional and landscape levels, but partly positive at the stand scale. However, at all three scales, habitat amounts were far below critical thresholds for the maintenance of viable populations of species, let alone ecological integrity. Collaboration among stakeholder categories should reject opinionated narratives, and instead rely on evidence-based knowledge about green infrastructure pressures, responses, and states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Wood-living beetles make up a large proportion of forest biodiversity and contribute to important ecosystem services, including decomposition. Beetle communities in managed southern boreal forests are less species rich than in natural and near-natural forest stands. In addition, many beetle species rely primarily on specific tree species. Yet, the associations between individual beetle species, forest management category, and tree species are seldom quantified, even for red-listed beetles. We compiled a beetle capture dataset from flight intercept traps placed on Norway spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus sp.), and Eurasian aspen (Populus tremulae) trees in 413 sites in mature managed forest, near-natural forest, and clear-cuts in southeastern Norway. We used joint species distribution models to estimate the strength of associations for 368 saproxylic beetle species (including 20 vulnerable, endangered, or critical red-listed species) for each forest management category and tree species. Tree species on which traps were mounted had the largest effect on beetle communities; oaks had the most highly associated beetle species, including most of the red-listed species, followed by Norway spruce and Eurasian aspen. Most beetle species were more likely to be captured in near-natural than in mature managed forest. Our estimated associations were compatible – for many species – with categorical classifications found in several existing databases of saproxylic beetle preferences. These quantitative beetle-habitat associations will improve future analyses that have typically relied on categorical classifications. Our results highlight the need to prioritize conservation of near-natural forests and oak trees in Scandinavia to protect the habitat of many red-listed species in particular. Furthermore, we underline the importance of carefully considering the species of trees on which traps are mounted in order to representatively sample beetle communities in forest stands. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Recent forests may be an asset for green infrastructure and ecological restoration, but studies are needed of the variation in forest biodiversity among sites, and possible reasons for observed patterns. In boreonemoral Scandinavia, reforestation occurs on abandoned agricultural land, and we studied 27 such recent (40–80 years old) mixed forests with temperate deciduous trees and boreal trees including Norway spruce, and their communities of dead wood fungi and vascular plants. By analysing aerial photos from 1960 and 2017, we explored how species richness and composition within sites vary with historical and present tree cover, and separately spruce cover, at site scale (2 ha) and within the surroundings (12.5 ha). Tree cover, and the percentage spruce cover, had increased considerably from 1960 and 2017, while open areas had decreased accordingly, at both scales. We found no significant relationships between species richness of forest plants, or fungi on coarse woody debris, and tree cover at any scale. On the other hand, species richness of grassland plants, and fungi on fine woody debris, showed significant negative correlations with high tree cover, and thus the recent forests with the highest total species richness seem to occur in surroundings with lower tree cover, currently dominated by agriculture. The reason may be a correlation between richer soils and more agriculture; the area with the richest soil have been extensively cleared and cultivated, and therefore currently have lower tree cover and more fragmented forests. Furthermore, ordination analysis showed that several deciduous tree species were negatively correlated with tree cover, locally and in the surroundings, while the tree species preferring rich soil such as Fraxinus and Ulmus (and several associated fungal species), were positively correlated with spruce cover. A possible explanation is that spruce colonize well on abandoned grasslands and therefore tends to be associated with grassland plants and trees requiring the richer soils of these areas. We suggest that recent forests in boreonemoral areas could be used for instance for restoration of temperate deciduous woodland, especially in areas dominated by agriculture, but that recurrent management may be needed to avoid spruce domination. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use, and economic profitability of forest biomass production were studied under four alternative initial age structures of a forested landscape (young, even-aged, middle-aged and mature) in boreal conditions over 80 years. The forested landscapes occupied either by Scots pine or Norway spruce were managed by using seven management scenarios. The current thinning recommendations were considered as a baseline and alternative scenarios included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking than in the baseline. The previous ones were also managed by using N fertilization, and an unthinned scenario (with final felling) was used as a comparison. A life cycle assessment tool with inputs from a forest ecosystem model was used to calculate full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use in substituting fossil-fuel-intensive materials and fossil fuels. The results showed that increased stocking and N fertilization were generally the most optimal forest management scenarios for full climate impacts and economic profitability in both species. Increased carbon sequestration through forest management surpassed the decreased economic profitability, and no single management scenario maximized both climate impact and economic profitability. The lowest climate impact, but the highest economic profitability, was found for the initially mature age structure. The calculated average displacement factors for the harvested wood products served as valid indicators for climate impacts but could not thoroughly depict the absolute climate impacts. More research is needed to improve the dynamic connection between forest ecosystem carbon balances and the substitution effects of harvested wood products. © 2021

AB  - This study explores the decade-long effects of release cutting around old retained oaks (Quercus robur L.) in a Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) stand that was 33 year old when thinned. The impacts on both nature conservation values and spruce wood production were evaluated in a randomized block design. To release oaks from competition, stems of Norway spruce were cut around 33 oaks, in three different treatments: high release (HR), medium release (MR) and no release (NR). Trees within a circular sample plot (15 m radius from the oak) were measured at time of treatment and 10 years after. The treatment effects on stand development, oak vitality and understory vegetation were evaluated after ten years, using tree diameter, height measurements, oak crown and tree structure estimates as well as ground vegetation surveys. Release cutting did not impact spruce production within the sample plot, and given that there were no other obvious sources of spruce suppression in the stand, we speculate that release cutting has little to no impact at the stand scale. Oak crowns in the control plots (NR) became smaller after ten years, while the crowns expanded and colonized the gap in the release treatments. Simultaneously, the amount of dead wood in the crown increased among oaks in the control treatment, indicating dieback. Cover and species richness of vascular plants in the understory were significantly higher in the HR and MR treatments compared to NR. These results suggest that the creation of relatively wide gaps (greater than 2 m) around retained oak crowns is one efficient approach to maintain their conservation values in a spruce-dominated stand on a longer time frame. This will allow oaks to expand their crowns, increase their vitality and increase species richness and diversity of plants under the canopy. The economic loss of creating large gaps instead of no gaps may be negligible since the overall spruce production was not affected within 15 m of each oak. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Traditional clear-fell forestry greatly alters community structure and ecosystem function within boreal forests and alternative management practices may reduce these impacts. Continuous-cover forestry can maintain similar invertebrate and plant communities to unmanaged forest, but whether this extends to soil fungal communities remains unclear. Within four sites across the mid-boreal zone of Sweden, we conducted a comprehensive study to assess the impact of continuous-cover and clear-felling on soil fungi and chemical properties within Norway spruce dominated forests, using unmanaged forest as a control. We sampled soils for chemical properties (pH, carbon, nitrogen, C/N and Organic matter) and used both surveys of fungal fruiting bodies and state of the DNA metabarcoding techniques to assess treatment effects on soil fungal communities. We found that forest management practices had significant effects soil pH, C and C/N ratio and that continuous-cover forestry had more similar soil properties to unmanaged forest. Furthermore, the biodiversity of fruiting bodies, as expressed by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, was higher in continuous-cover forestry and unmanaged forest compared to clear-felled areas. However, the opposite was true for the diversity of soil fungal communities, which was probably due to the high level of disturbance in clear-felled areas, and thus, ample habitat for early successional colonisers and some remnants of mature forest communities. However, in agreement with predictions we found that the composition of both fruiting body and soil fungal communities broadly similar in continuous-cover and unmanaged forest, but fundamentally different to clear-felled areas. Consequently, our findings highlight that continuous-cover forestry is an alternative to conventional practise, maintaining communities associated with unmanaged forest and mimicking natural disturbance regimes. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - This chapter revolves around a case in a southern Sámi area in Norway where the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy halted the plan to build a wind power station on traditional reindeer herding lands in 2016. International law applicable to Indigenous peoples played a significant role in the argumentation of the decision, which leads to the question of state compliance with the norms and rules laid down in international law. Given how important the decision was for the reindeer herding communities, the reasoning behind it calls for further investigation. The ministerial decision on the planned Kalvvatnan wind power project re-examined the judgment of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and refused to license the building of a plant due to the reindeer herding communities’ concerns. These concerns are enshrined in the procedural and material requirements of international legal standards, in particular Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the context of increased conflicts between large-scale industries and Indigenous livelihoods, I will examine the outcome of the Kalvvatnan case to discuss state application of international law. Based on a review of the decision and other case documents, I will approach the question as a qualitative assessment through the lens of compliance indicators. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Monica Tennberg, Else Grete Broderstad and Hans-Kristian Hernes; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - As wild ungulate densities increase across Europe and North America, plant–herbivore interactions are increasingly important from ecological and economic perspectives. These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant–herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species. However, wolf territory presence had negative effects on browsing occurrence and pressure when interacting with secondary roads, young forest, or snow cover. We showed that roads can influence browsing patterns in Norway and Sweden. However, further research is needed, particularly in the face of continued infrastructure development in Scandinavia. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Arctic mining has a bad reputation because the extractive industry is often responsible for a suite of environmental problems. Yet, few studies explore the gap between untouched tundra and messy megaproject from a historical perspective. Our paper focuses on Advent City as a case study of the emergence of coal mining in Svalbard (Norway) coupled with the onset of mining-related environmental change. After short but intensive human activity (1904-1908), the ecosystem had a century to respond, and we observe a lasting impact on the flora in particular. With interdisciplinary contributions from historical archaeology, archaeozoology, archaeobotany and botany, supplemented by stable isotope analysis, we examine 1) which human activities initially asserted pressure on the Arctic environment, 2) whether the miners at Advent City were "eco-conscious,"for example whether they showed concern for the environment and 3) how the local ecosystem reacted after mine closure and site abandonment. Among the remains of typical mining infrastructure, we prioritised localities that revealed the subtleties of long-term anthropogenic impact. Significant pressure resulted from landscape modifications, the import of non-native animals and plants, hunting and fowling, and the indiscriminate disposal of waste material. Where it was possible to identify individual inhabitants, these shared an economic attitude of waste not, want not, but they did not hold the environment in high regard. Ground clearances, animal dung and waste dumps continue to have an effect after a hundred years. The anthropogenic interference with the fell field led to habitat creation, especially for vascular plants. The vegetation cover and biodiversity were high, but we recorded no exotic or threatened plant species. Impacted localities generally showed a reduction of the natural patchiness of plant communities, and highly eutrophic conditions were unsuitable for liverworts and lichens. Supplementary isotopic analysis of animal bones added data to the marine reservoir offset in Svalbard underlining the far-reaching potential of our multi-proxy approach. We conclude that although damaging human-environment interactions formerly took place at Advent City, these were limited and primarily left the visual impact of the ruins. The fell field is such a dynamic area that the subtle anthropogenic effects on the local tundra may soon be lost. The fauna and flora may not recover to what they were before the miners arrived, but they will continue to respond to new post-industrial circumstances.  © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - In even-aged clear-cutting forestry, the biodiversity effects of treatments must be well understood for proper forest management and conservation. While biodiversity on clear-cuts has been much studied, other common forestry stages such as thinning have received less attention. We studied saproxylic beetles, a highly diverse group with many red-listed species, in young spruce stands 2–5 years after pre-commercial thinning. This intervention often creates sun-exposed dead wood, also of deciduous trees such as birch, potentially favoring many of these beetle species. To help evaluate this forestry stage, we compared the saproxylic beetle fauna of 10 thinned spruce stands with that of 10 geographically matched semi-natural woodland key habitats (WKHs) in Sweden. Local and overall species numbers of saproxylic beetles were similar in the two forest types, but they differed in species composition. Compared with WKHs, thinned stands had an overall lower number of species on deciduous wood, fungivorous species, and red-listed or previously red-listed species. Between-stand diversity was also lower for thinned than for WKH stands. Thus, while pre-commercially thinned spruce forests hosted many saproxylic beetle species, including some red-listed ones, WKHs provide habitat for a more variable fauna, especially for beetle groups of conservation concern. Woodland key habitats, although small, are a valuable complement to young production forests of spruce for the conservation of saproxylic beetle species. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The coastal heathland of Western Europe, dominated by Calluna vulgaris L., was previously maintained by prescribed-burning and grazing to the extent that the Calluna became anthropogenically adapted to regular burning cycles. This 5000–6000-year-old land management practice was essential for local biodiversity and created a vegetation free from major wildland fires. In Norway, recent neglect has, however, caused accumulation of live and dead biomass. Invasion of juniper and Sitka spruce has resulted in limited biodiversity and increasing wildland fire fuels. At the Kringsjå cabin and sheep farm, Haugesund, an area of previous fire safe heathland has been restored through fire-agriculture. Kringsjå is located close to several important Viking Age sites and the Steinsfjellet viewpoint, a popular local tourist destination. The motivation for the present study is to analyse this facility and investigate possibilities for synergies between landscape management and tourism as a route to sustainable transitions. The present study compares restored heathland vegetation with unmanaged heathland at Kringsjå. The potential for activities is also analysed based on the proximity to the tourist attractions in the region. The Kringsjå area demonstrates different vegetation conditions depending on level of afforestation, Calluna heath maintenance, and gracing. Within a few minutes’ walk, dense Sitka spruce communities with desert-like forest floor may be compared to native forest floors, Calluna dominated heathland, and grazing fields. It turns out that Kringsjå may become a showcase for resuming prescribed burning and grazing for fire-safe rich landscapes, while offering cultural and historical experiences for all age groups. Moreover, tourism may become a source of income required for supporting ongoing restoration initiatives. To start working on a common vision, preferably aligned with existing "Homeland of the Viking Kings" tourism approach, should be one of the first steps along this path. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Intensive forest management has been applied in most Fennoscandian forests for a period of almost one felling rotation. This paradigm has produced even-aged and even-structured forests of different successional stages that cover about 90% of forest land. At the same time, wildfires have been nearly eliminated in most of the Fennoscandian nature. Consequently, hundreds of species are red-listed because of forest management. To support these species, forest management requires improvements. Variable retention forestry and habitat restoration have been suggested to mitigate negative effects of forest management on biodiversity, and these have been practiced to some extent during the past few decades. Here, we review experimental results on the effects of variable retention and two restoration measures (prescribed burning and artificial addition of coarse woody debris) on different species groups in Fennoscandia. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Many species respond positively to felling within a few years, apparently due to released and often ephemeral resources, such as fresh residue and stumps. Species associated with shady conditions are negatively impacted, but any retention supports many of these, and their species composition remains almost unaffected with 50–70% retention of the initial tree volume. (ii) These effects remain detectable for at least 10–30 years or, according to some studies, nearly 100 years, e.g., in polypore fungi. (iii) Initial effects of prescribed burning on most species groups (apart from pyrophiles) are negative, but within 10–15 years post-fire sites begin to support many rare and threatened deadwood-dependent species. Epiphytic lichens, however, remain negatively affected. (iv) Artificial addition of deadwood (mostly high stumps) supports a wide spectrum of deadwood-dependent species, but the species composition differs from that of naturally died trees. (v) Moisture and micro-habitat variation are crucial for forest species at harvested sites, at least in forests dominated by Norway spruce. We conclude that felling method as such is of little importance for threatened forest species, although retention mitigates many negative effects. These species require microclimatic continuity, and maintenance and active increase of legacies, such as deadwood of different qualities (species, downed/standing, snag/log/stump, decay stage), very old trees, and tree species mixtures. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Retention approaches in forest management are today common in several North European countries, integrated into the clearcutting practice as a way to promote biodiversity and maintain ecosystem functions. Individual green trees and retention patches (tree groups) are retained at final harvest, and deadwood is left at site or created. Here, we review research on retention in Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Baltic States, and NW Russia, with special focus on biodiversity. Following the first publication in 1994, about 180 peer-reviewed articles have been published. We present results from a systematic search of the retention literature, separated into the following topics: buffer zones, retention patches, high stumps, other types of deadwood, European aspen Populus tremula, and cost-efficiency. Russian literature is synthesized separately since studies from this region have so far almost exclusively been published in the Russian language. Furthermore, we describe six ongoing large-scale, replicated experiments with varying retention levels, five in Finland and one in Sweden, and summarize their main results. Among main conclusions for practice from the literature and experiments are that retention patches as large as 0.5 ha and 10-m-wide buffers to watercourses are not enough to maintain pre-harvest species composition but survival of forest species is still larger than on conventional clearcuts. Deadwood on clearcuts may present important habitats to saproxylic species, including rare and red-listed ones and a prioritization of tree species per stand is recommended. We identify several important future research directions including switch of focus towards the landscape as well as the species population level. Surveys in parts of European Russia where retention has been unintentionally implemented already for a century would indicate possible future trajectories of biodiversity and their drivers in other regions of Northern Europe. A stronger link to ecological theory would help in study designs and in the formulation of predicted outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - We analysed how logging residue (LR) piles of common tree species in Finland, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), affect nitrogen (N) losses in forest soil after final felling. A Norway spruce dominated stand was clear-cut and followed by two experimental setups to study the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and leaching of carbon (C) and N. Experiments consisted of four treatments: tree species treatments consisting of 40 kg m−2 of LR and a control treatment without residues. The C losses were monitored as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the N losses as ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) fluxes and concentrations in soil percolation waters and the N2O emissions as fluxes from the forest soil to the atmosphere. In addition the soil temperatures, the molecular size distribution of the DOC from the soil percolation waters and the origin of the N2O production were determined. The LR piles lowered the soil temperatures and, especially those of birch, increased the concentrations of NO3-N in the soil percolation waters already 1 year after the establishment of the piles. The LR piles increased the NH4-N concentrations. The smallest molecular size fraction (<1 kD) of DOC predominated in all treatments. The N2O fluxes peaked under the piles during the second and third growing seasons; however, the inconsistent fluxes tended to be low. The production of N2O was driven by both nitrification and denitrification processes, the proportion depending on the tree species. Our results indicate that LR piles accelerate N losses 1 year after the clear-cutting, especially NO3-N, which predominates in the soil percolation waters under the birch residues, whereas spruce residues tend to stimulate N2O emissions longer. These results have implications for sustainable forest management practices and nutrition of regrowing vegetation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The inherently unknown future development of a Nordic bio-economy was studied with four scenarios applied in an ecosystem service assessment framework. This framework couples CORINE land use cover with estimates of 15 final ecosystem services from the CICES 5.1 classification in biophysical and monetary terms. Current land use in two catchments, Lillebæk (83% cropland, area 4.7 km2, Denmark) and Ovre Haldenvassdraget (67% forest, 1006 km2, Norway) was compared with four scenarios for 2050. One scenario focusing on sustainability and environmental awareness led to considerable changes in land use and ecosystem service delivery (more diverse provisioning and higher value of regulating services, but not a higher total economic value), whereas the other three did not deviate markedly from the current scenario. Projected land use scenarios were verified with experts and stakeholder representatives. We conclude that the framework has sufficient resolution to show differences in service delivery among scenarios. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Intensive management of boreal forests impairs forest biodiversity and species of old-growth forest. Effective measures to support biodiversity require detection of locations valuable for conservation. We applied species distribution models (SDMs) to a species of mature forest, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis, goshawk), that is often associated with hotspots of forest biodiversity. We located optimal sites for the goshawk on a landscape scale, assessed their state under intensified logging operations and identified characteristics of goshawks' nesting sites in boreal forests. Optimal sites for the goshawk covered only 3.4% of the boreal landscape and were mostly located outside protected areas, which highlights the importance of conservation actions in privately-owned forests. Furthermore, optimal sites for the goshawk and associated biodiversity were under threat. Half of them were logged to some extent and 10% were already lost or notably deteriorated due to logging shortly after 2015 for which our models were calibrated. Habitat suitability for the goshawk increased with increasing volume of Norway spruce (Picea abies) peaking at 220 m3 ha−1, and with small quantities of birches (Betula spp.) and other broad-leaved trees. Threats to biodiversity of mature spruce forests are likely to accelerate in the future with increasing logging pressures and shorter rotation periods. Logging should be directed less to forests with high biodiversity. Continuous supply of mature spruce forests in the landscape should be secured with a denser network of protected areas and measures that aid in sparing large entities of mature forest on privately-owned land. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Habitat fragmentation may affect species distributions through, for example, altered resource availability and shifts in species interactions. Fragmentation by roads has had negative impacts on Fennoscandian alpine ecosystems, with reduction of habitats and connectivity for alpine species. Concurrently, infrastructure development causes influx of subsidies through roadkills and litter, which may facilitate expansion of boreal scavenging species, such as the red fox Vulpes vulpes, which may intensify negative interactions with alpine species. Hence, understanding the impact of subsidies within marginal alpine areas is imperative for successful conservation and management of particularly vulnerable alpine species. We used snow tracking and camera traps in three alpine tundra areas in Norway to investigate whether the presence of boreal scavengers was positively associated with highways during winter, and if this contrasted the pattern of a critically endangered alpine species, the Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus. In summer, artificial nests were used to assess whether predation risk was related to proximity to highways. During winter, the occurrence of red foxes was higher close to highways and decreased with increasing distance to highways, while the arctic fox showed no discernible pattern. Red fox occurrence increased with the number of edible items of anthropogenic origin located along highways, whereas arctic fox occurrence decreased. The overall predation risk of artificial nests during summer was high (>31.2%) and increased with proximity to the highway in the area with highest traffic volume. Synthesis and applications. Highways crossing alpine areas may attract boreal scavengers, possibly connected to increased access to subsidies of anthropogenic origin. Litter and food waste dominated available subsidies along highways in our study, and prevailing mitigating measures directed at reducing roadkill and movement restrictions may not be applicable to reduce negative effects of littering. We recommend actions focusing on informational campaigns, improved garbage disposal facilities and routines, and imposing fines for littering, to reduce negative impacts on vulnerable species. This is likely needed to achieve goals of ‘no impact’ from the physical loss of habitats due to road development. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens plant and pollinator communities, as well as their interactions. However, the effects of landscape fragmentation on the pollination of wild plant species are not well understood yet, partly because there are many correlated features in fragmented landscapes (e.g., decreased patch size, increased isolation, and patch complexity) whose influences are difficult to disentangle. Using a structural equation modeling approach, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of landscape fragmentation (patch size, isolation and complexity, percentage of surrounding land in forest) on the abundance, functional-group richness, and evenness of pollinators of 24 habitat fragments within an agricultural landscape in Southern Norway. In addition, we studied how these variables affected visitation rates (visits per flower) and seed production (seed set, seed mass) in the four most abundant plant species in the area. Flower abundance was higher in larger and complex patches and decreased with the percentage of forest in the surroundings, while flower richness increased with patch complexity. We found a direct negative relationship between patch complexity and the overall number of pollinator visits that the habitat fragments received. Apart from this direct landscape effect, pollinator visits were mostly affected by the floral communities, with overall flower abundance and richness increasing both total number of pollinator visits and pollinator-group richness, and flower richness having an additional negative influence on pollinator-group evenness. Interestingly, we did not find any direct link between visitation rates and reproductive success for any of the study plant species. Instead, several landscape variables directly affected species seed production, although the effects of landscape on seed production were highly species specific. Patch complexity had a negative effect on seed production in two of the four focal species, while other components of the landscape had species-specific effects. Increasing fragmentation of agricultural landscapes affects pollination interactions at the community level and the reproduction of wild plants. However, understanding the effects of fragmentation on seed production requires going beyond estimating visitation rates, since landscape effects on plant reproduction are not always related to overall interaction frequencies. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - In the boreal forest, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a key species due to its many strong food web linkages and its exploitation of niches that form in the wake of human activities. Recent altitudinal range expansion and a perceived population increase have become topics of concern in Scandinavia, primarily due to the potential impacts of red foxes on both prey and competitor species. However, despite it being a common species, there is still surprisingly little knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics of its population dynamics. In this study, we synthesized 12 years of snow-track transect data covering a 27,000-km2 study area to identify factors associated with red fox distribution and population dynamics. Using Bayesian hierarchical regression models, we evaluated the relationships of landscape productivity and climate gradients as well as anthropogenic subsidies with an index of red fox population size and growth rates. We found that landscapes with high human settlement density and large amounts of gut piles from moose (Alces alces) hunting were associated with higher red fox abundances. Population dynamics were characterized by direct density-dependent growth, and the structure of density dependence was best explained by the amount of agricultural land in the landscape. Population equilibrium levels increased, and populations were more stable, in areas with a higher presence of agricultural lands, whereas density-dependent population growth was more prominent in areas of low agricultural presence. We conclude that human land use is a dominant driver of red fox population dynamics in the boreal forest. We encourage further research focusing on contrasting effects of anthropogenic subsidization on predator population carrying capacities and temporal stability, and potential impacts on prey dynamics. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Globally, boreal forests cover 33 percent of Earth's forested area, constitute the largest terrestrial carbon source, and house an important biodiversity of forest-dependent species, many of which are saproxylic taxa reliant on a wide variety of dead wood. This dead wood is most prevalent in old-growth forest, yet intensive management means that little old growth is left, and the remaining forests rarely attain the necessary age and structure to resemble these original forests. There is increasing recognition, however, that forests that have not been subjected to modern, stand-replacing harvest methods (like clear-cutting), and in which management activities are no longer occurring, may be able to provide habitat similar to old-growth forest for many species (older mean age, higher deadwood volumes, and more age-class heterogeneity). These are called ‘near-natural’ forests. We use linear mixed models and redundancy analysis (RDA) to compare beetle species richness and community composition using a large, mixed data set, containing more than one third of all beetle species known from Norway, from window trap records in three types of forest: intensively managed mature stands, recent clear-cuts, and ‘near-natural forests’. Even though location, study substrate and other sampling details vary substantially between sites, the signal from management still comes out as a significant factor explaining the patterns on beetle diversity. We find that species richness of saproxylic, natural-forest indicator, and red-listed beetle species is higher in both near-natural forests and recent clear-cuts than in managed mature forests. Community composition also differs significantly between the three forest types, and these differences are correlated with forest age and volume at the landscape (1 km radius) level. These findings provide support for the idea that near-natural forests provide habitats that are distinct from those in managed forests and which are important for species of conservation concern. Clear-cuts briefly harbor some of these same species, probably due to the sun-exposed coarse woody debris (CWD) that is available immediately after felling, but this effect is transient. Conservation of existing near-natural forests, many of which are currently without legal protection, should therefore be prioritized. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - This chapter deals with the grasslands of Northern Europe (Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), with a focus on natural and semi-natural grasslands of the lowlands, thus treating arctic-alpine and strongly intensified types only marginally. At present, grasslands cover ca. 7% of the study region, half of which are natural grasslands (mostly arctic-alpine, to a smaller extent also azonal and extra-zonal) and the other half secondary grasslands created by human land use (livestock grazing or haymaking). Both grassland categories have high importance for biodiversity in many taxa. However, particularly the secondary grasslands are profoundly negatively affected by area loss (conversion to other land uses) and quality loss (mainly due to intensification and to abandonment). Conservation measures typically try to mimic traditional low-intensity land uses that are agronomically not profitable anymore. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changing land use from agriculture to forestry affects global carbon (C) balances. In addition to reduce using fossil fuels, climatic benefits may be reached by increasing forested areas where appropriate. At present, there is limited data concerning whether differences in C sequestration rates occur among tree species. In this study we evaluated the effects of various species on C sequestration at an early stage of afforestation. Total C stocks, i.e. C in biomass, litter and soil, were compiled for hybrid aspen, poplar, silver birch, Norway spruce, larch and willow. The species were planted in random blocks on five sites at different latitudes. Soil, litter and plant biomass were sampled repeatedly, except for root biomass which was calculated from functions found in the literature. There were no differences between species in total C stocks after 8–9 years growth, except for short rotation coppice (SRC) willows that reached a high production early due to a higher stand density compared to the species managed with short rotation forestry (SRF). Total C sequestration rates for sites varied from zero to 2.3–4.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1. There were no effects of species on soil organic carbon (SOC), but significant decreases were noted for sites with high initial amounts, while SOC was unchanged or increased on sites with lower initial amounts. Mean SOC sequestration rates for sites ranged between −3.0 to 0.78 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Thus, former land use and time since abandonment rather than species seemed to influence the SOC pools at this early stage of afforestation. There were few differences between species in litter C in these young stands. We conclude that increased tree productivity had a positive effect on total C sequestration. It is crucial to include C in both biomass and soil when discussing C capture at land use change. The time factor is important and experiments like this should be followed for an extended time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ensuring sustainable carnivore populations while simultaneously sustaining active and viable pastoral communities often creates conflicts that are difficult to resolve. This article examines how different knowledge systems meet and interact in large carnivore governance in Norway and Sweden. Drawing on a broad range of sources, including observations in meetings, public documents, reports and interviews, in addition to local and national newspaper clippings and internet sites, we study two processes of regional carnivore management (Nordland, Norway and Jämtland, Sweden). We explore how different forms of knowledge have been mobilized, reproduced, transferred and legitimized in policies and regulations in these two processes. Furthermore, we examine the interplay between scientific and experience-based knowledge at different levels and scales in both countries. In Norway, “clear zoning” has been established as a basic management instrument to achieve national “population goals” for carnivores. We show how the locally situated knowledge – in our account represented through the Regional Large Carnivore Committee (RLCC), which includes political parties’ and Sami Parliament representatives – experiences real barriers by being overruled by the national Ministry of Climate and Environment, 2016 in their process of revising the carnivore management plan (CMP). In Sweden where the management of large carnivores is devolved to regional authorities and stakeholder-based Wildlife Management Delegations (WMDs), attempts to regionally solve conflicts are often overthrown by the national environmental protection agency or through court cases initiated by the environmental movement. Hence, compromises that potentially could solve conflicts are undermined. The analysis shows that while carnivore governance in both countries are founded on decentralized management authority at the regional level, local actors struggle for their views, experiences and knowledge to be acknowledged and counted as valid in the management process. While the decentralized management model opens for inclusion of different knowledge systems, this system has yet to acknowledge the challenges of knowledge being dismissed or marginalized across governance levels and scales. © Copyright © 2020 Sjölander-Lindqvist, Risvoll, Kaarhus, Lundberg and Sandström.

AB  - Harvesting large carnivores can be a management tool for meeting politically set goals for their desired abundance. However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Since the 1960s, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and recently, social impact assessments (SIAs), have been conducted during the planning stages of large development projects to identify potential adverse effects and propose mitigation measures to ameliorate these impacts. EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible positive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, including biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https://osf.io/cvh3u/) and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text. Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts, and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitigation measures from practitioners' knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges including scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners' knowledge. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - There is increasing empirical support for the biodiversity and ecosystem service (ES) benefits of mixed-species production forests. However, few studies control for the spatial arrangement of the trees within mixtures to determine the influence that clustering the tree species (patch scale mixtures), versus evenly dispersing them (intimate scale mixtures), may have for biodiversity and ES outcomes. To highlight the potential implications of altering tree spatial arrangement in mixtures, and the need to fill related knowledge gaps, here we provide a qualitative multi-disciplinary overview of ecological and socio-economic drivers with the potential to alter biodiversity, ecosystem services, and management-related outcomes from patch versus intimate scale mixtures. We focused our overview on even-aged mixtures of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula pendula or B. pubescens) in Sweden, which enabled us to contrast findings within a biogeographical and silvicultural setting. Specifically, we targeted implications for biodiversity (understory vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, saproxylic beetles, birds), biomass production, harvesting costs, management ease, recreation and aesthetics, cervid game, as well as abiotic and biotic risks (wind, fire, pathogens, pests, browsing damage). In the absence of direct empirical evidence, we primarily relied on expert inference from theory and relevant empirical studies sourced from the Fennoscandian region, and further afield if needed. Collectively these efforts allowed us to develop a number of informed hypotheses indicating that for spruce-birch mixtures in this region, patch scale mixtures may have the potential to favour the diversity of several forest dependant taxonomic groups, cervid game and reduce harvesting costs, whereas intimate mixtures may have the potential to reduce pathogen and pest damage, and likewise, potentially benefit production outcomes. Current knowledge was too limited, inconsistent or context dependant to even tentatively infer outcomes for fire risk, wind damage, browsing damage, management ease, recreational and aesthetic outcomes. We emphasize that our hypotheses require testing, but are sufficient to (1) highlight the likely importance of spatial-scale to biodiversity and ecosystem services outcomes in mixed-species production forests, (2) caution against generalization from mixture studies that lack scale considerations, and (3) motivate the targeted consideration of spatial grain in future mixture studies. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The concept of Woodland Key Habitats (WKH, small-scaled presumed hotspots of biodiversity) has become an essential component of biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian and Baltic forests. There have been debates over the importance of WKHs in relation to the conservation of biodiversity in production forests. We applied a systematic review protocol and meta-analysis to summarize knowledge on comparisons of biodiversity qualities, such as dead wood and species richness, between WKHs and production forests in relevant countries. We also summarized the knowledge on the impact of edge effects by comparing WKHs surrounded by production forests to WKHs surrounded by clear cuts. Studies had been conducted in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on our meta-analysis, WKHs seem to be relative hotspots for dead wood volume, diversity of dead wood, number of species and number of red-listed species. There were some differences also between countries in these biodiversity qualities. Only two studies compared WKHs surrounded by production forests and clear cuts, respectively. Hence, the capability of WKHs to maintain their original species composition and support species persistence over time remains to be addressed, as well as their role in relation to other conservation tools.

AB  - There are currently competing demands on Europe's forests and the finite resources and services that they can offer. Forestry intensification that aims at mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation is one example. Whether or not these two objectives compete can be evaluated by comparative studies of forest landscapes with different histories. We test the hypothesis that indicators of wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related in a gradient of long to short forestry intensification histories. Forest management data containing stand age, volume and tree species were used to model the opportunity for wood production and biodiversity conservation in five north European forest regions representing a gradient in landscape history from very long in the West and short in the East. Wood production indicators captured the supply of coniferous wood and total biomass, as well as current accessibility by transport infrastructure. Biodiversity conservation indicators were based on modelling habitat network functionality for focal bird species dependent on different combinations of stand age and tree species composition representing naturally dynamic forests. In each region we randomly sampled 25 individual 100-km(2) areas with contiguous forest cover. Regarding wood production, Sweden's Bergslagen region had the largest areas of coniferous wood, followed by Vitebsk in Belarus and Zemgale in Latvia. NW Russia's case study regions in Pskov and Komi had the lowest values, except for the biomass indicator. The addition of forest accessibility for transportation made the Belarusian and Swedish study region most suitable for wood and biomass production, followed by Latvia and two study regions in NW Russian. Regarding biodiversity conservation, the overall rank among regions was opposite. Mixed and deciduous habitats were functional in Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Old Scots pine and Norway spruce habitats were only functional in Komi. Thus, different regional forest histories provide different challenges in terms of satisfying both wood production and biodiversity conservation objectives in a forest management unit. These regional differences in northern Europe create opportunities for exchanging experiences among different regional contexts about how to achieve both objectives. We discuss this in the context of land-sharing versus land-sparing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context Theory predicts that species diversity of isolated habitat patches depends on patch size and isolation. However, there are few previous studies of how patch size and isolation influence community composition. This study tested theory using small and isolated farmland patches in a forested matrix. Objectives I tested whether bird species diversity and community composition of isolated farmland patches depended on patch size, measures of isolation (e.g. distance from the main farmland areas; up to 15 km), and other variables such as presence of human habitation. Methods Farmland bird species diversity and community composition (relative proportions of different ecological guilds) of 130 farmland patches within forest landscapes were recorded in Norway. Results Species diversity and proportion of the species that nested on the ground or low in bushes increased with patch size. Distance from the main farmland region was not related to species diversity or community composition, but species diversity increased when there were stepping stones present. Sites inhabited by humans had higher species diversity, a larger proportion of species nesting high in trees or in cavities (such as in buildings), and a larger proportion of resident species. Other variables were less important. There was also a strong relationship between the occupancy of individual species in the main farmland region and their occupancy in the forest region, suggesting that colonisation pressure also influenced species diversity of these habitat islands. Conclusions I found weak evidence of isolation effects on bird species diversity and community composition of farmland patches within forest, whereas most of the variation was explained by patch size and presence of humans.

AB  - The relative merits of land sparing versus land sharing are being debated within conservation biology. While the debate is multifaceted, a central issue concerns the ability of biodiversity to actually persist in shared' human-dominated landscapes. There is a widespread perception that large predators are synonymous with wilderness and have a low tolerance for human-modified landscapes. However, there is an increasing body of evidence that is questioning this paradigm. In order to explore the tolerance levels of Eurasian lynx to human activity, we have analysed data on 49 lynx home ranges in south-eastern Norway occupying a gradient of landscapes from near wilderness to the urban-forest interface. Our results indicate that lynx have the ability to tolerate relatively high levels of human presence both within their home ranges and within the immediate surroundings of their home ranges. Home-range orientations reflect preference for areas associated with low levels of human-induced habitat modification, and avoidance of the more heavily disturbed areas. The results show that lynx have a large potential to exist in shared landscapes if their presence is tolerated by people.

AB  - To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended.

AB  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) was introduced in Atlantic Europe in the nineteenth century. Forests of this species are the major forest type in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with substantial areas in Norway, France and Denmark. Most forests are managed under a patch clearfelling regime on comparatively short (35-50 years) rotations. However, forest policies in a number of countries seek to increase the structural and species diversity of Sitka spruce forests: such measures are also proposed to help adapt to projected climate change and management of climate risk. Datasets from 26 experimental plots in Atlantic Europe representing existing and alternative management approaches showed high carbon stocks under current management and lower stocks in all alternatives. In addition, there was little evidence of Sitka spruce being grown successfully in long-term intimate mixture. Thinning is required to increase the diversity of Sitka spruce forests, but this can result in increased risk of wind damage, and hence reduction in carbon stocks, other than on the most sheltered sites. Such risks will be higher with the wetter soils anticipated from greater winter rainfall. Future management of Sitka spruce forests for carbon sequestration should focus both on improvement of current management (e. g. use of higher-yielding genotypes) and on developing wind-stable stands through careful thinning to act as long-term carbon stores.

AB  - The overall aim of this work was to assess the effects of stump and root extraction on the long-term carbon sequestration and average carbon storage in the integrated production of energy biomass and stemwood (pulpwood and sawlogs) under different thinning options (unthinned, current thinning and 30% increased thinning thresholds from current thresholds). The growth and development of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) stands on a fertile site (Oxalis-myrtillus) in central Finland (Joensuu region: 6239?N, 2937?E) was simulated for two consecutive rotation periods (80+80years/160years). Stemwood and energy biomass production, carbon sequestration, and average storage and emission dynamics related to the entire production process of biomass were assessed. The assessment was done by employing a life cycle assessment tool, which combines simulation outputs from an ecosystem model and the related technosystem emissions. It was found that stump and root harvesting constituted 21-36% of the total biomass production (energy biomass and stemwood) depending on the thinning regimes and rotation period. No considerable effect was found in stemwood production when stump and root extraction was compared to the regime in which stumps and roots were left at the site. Stump and root extraction did not affect carbon sequestration on the following rotation and, in fact, an increase in forest growth was found for the unthinned and 30% increased thresholds compared to the first rotation. The results also showed that if current thinning threshold is increased, win-win situations are possible, especially when climate change mitigation is the main concern. The substitution of coal with energy biomass is possible without reducing carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. The utilization of energy biomass, including stumps and roots, instead of coal could reduce up to 33% of emissions over two rotation periods depending on the thinning regimes. Even if stumps and roots were excluded, a maximum of 19% carbon emissions could be reduced by using only logging residues.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape elements, such as roadsides, hedgerows, field edges, and power line clearings, can be managed to provide important habitats for wild bees. However, the effects of habitat improvement schemes in power line clearings on components of diversity are poorly studied. We conducted a large-scale experiment to test the effects of different management practices on the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of wild bees in power line clearings (n=19 sites across southeastern Norway) and explored whether any treatment effects were modified by the environmental context. At each site, we conducted the following treatments: (1) Cut: all trees cut and left to decay in the clearing; (2) Cut+Remove: all trees cut and removed from the plot; and (3) Uncut: uncleared. The site-specific environmental context (i.e., elevation and floral diversity) influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity within bee species assemblages. The largest number of species was found in the Cut+Remove treatment in plots with a high forb species richness, indicating that the outcome of management practices depends on the environmental context. Clearing of treatment plots with many forb species also appeared to alter the phylogenetic composition of bee species assemblages, that is, more closely related species were found in the Cut and the Cut+Remove plots than in the Uncut plots. Synthesis and applications: Our experimental simulation of management practices in power line clearings influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of bee species assemblages. Frequent clearing and removal of the woody debris at low elevations with a high forb species richness can increase the value of power line clearings for solitary bees. It is therefore important for managers to consider the environmental context when designing habitat improvement schemes for solitary bees.

AB  - This paper investigates how land-use management practices incorporate nature conservation concerns in four Norwegian rural municipalities. It focuses on nature conservation, which is vital both to maintain nature's ability to store carbon and to preserve ecosystems, as key aspects of the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The paper analyses the perceptions of local, regional and state stakeholders relating to four rural municipalities following diverging land-use trajectories. We find land policy in all four cases to be highly entangled with strategies to achieve growth in terms of income, job creation and population. When nature conservation was not in line with wider economic or social considerations, it was less integrated into land-policy practices. In three of the municipalities, the construction of residential units, holiday-homes or renewable energy parks was prioritized over the preservation of nature areas or cultural landscapes. One case presented a contrasting trajectory, as it involved a clear alignment between nature conservation and economic growth. Here, conservation was considered a key strategy to both sustain the traditional fishery industry and to accommodate the growing tourism. However, while this municipality's restrictive land use was based on a nature conservation understanding, it was also connected to the greenhouse-gas emissions, resource exhaustion and waste generation traditionally associated with international tourism. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of rural municipalities being equipped with sufficient resources if they are to prioritize environmental concerns over the economic and social dimensions of sustainability in their land-use management practices.

AB  - Questions        How does long-term increase in nutrient availability affect species composition, species diversity and functional composition in boreal rich fens, and how does this differ from short-term effects? What are the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes, and how does nutrient limitation influence species diversity in these communities?        LocationMethodsSOlendet Nature Reserve, central Norway.        A full-factorial field experiment. Plots in two localities received one of following treatments (n=3): no nutrient addition (control), N, P, K, NP, NK, PK and NPK addition. Cover of plant species was recorded before treatment, and after two and 15years of treatment.        ResultsConclusionsTwo years of nutrient addition caused small changes in species composition, but addition of NP led to large increase in abundance of species with high ability to exploit the added nutrientsa direct result of the elimination of nutrient limitation in the communities. After 15years of nutrient addition there were significant changes following three different pathways, one for each of N, P and NP addition. The addition of NP led to large community shifts, considerable species turnover and reduced species and functional richness, mainly caused by increase in cover of highly competitive and tussock-forming grasses like Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca ovina and Molinia caerulea, out-competing other species, especially bryophytes. Addition of N led to smaller changes in species turnover, and without clear dominant species. Addition of P led to considerable species turnover, but no reduction in species or functional richness, and the bryophyte diversity increased. This is explained by the bryophytes' association with N-fixing cyanobacteria, suggesting less N limitation and a greater ability to utilize the added P when vascular plants suffer from N shortage. In addition, bryophytes are more sensitive to low P availability, due to larger P requirements compared to vascular plants. There was no effect of K addition.        Both N and P limitation is essential for the maintenance of high species diversity in boreal rich fens, and P limitation controls bryophyte diversity. From a management perspective, N and P limitation is vital in the conservation of boreal rich fens or when a functional fen system is reestablished through restoration measures.

AB  - Changes in climate and land use, caused by socio-economic changes, greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural policies and other factors, are known to affect both natural and managed ecosystems, and will likely impact on the European terrestrial carbon balance during the coming decades. This study presents a comprehensive European Union wide (EU15 plus Norway and Switzerland, EU*) assessment of potential future changes in terrestrial carbon storage considering these effects based on four illustrative IPCC-SRES storylines (A1FI, A2, B1, B2). A process-based land vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM), adapted to include a generic representation of managed ecosystems, is forced with changing fields of land-use patterns from 1901 to 2100 to assess the effect of land-use and cover changes on the terrestrial carbon balance of Europe. The uncertainty in the future carbon balance associated with the choice of a climate change scenario is assessed by forcing LPJ-DGVM with output from four different climate models (GCMs: CGCM2, CSIRO2, HadCM3, PCM2) for the same SRES storyline. Decrease in agricultural areas and afforestation leads to simulated carbon sequestration for all land-use change scenarios with an average net uptake of 17-38 Tg C/year between 1990 and 2100, corresponding to 1.9-2.9% of the EU*s CO2 emissions over the same period. Soil carbon losses resulting from climate warming reduce or even offset carbon sequestration resulting from growth enhancement induced by climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the second half of the twenty-first century. Differences in future climate change projections among GCMs are the main cause for uncertainty in the cumulative European terrestrial carbon uptake of 4.4-10.1 Pg C between 1990 and 2100.

AB  - The mycetophilid fauna and environmental variables were studied at 15 sites within a spruce forest in southern Norway. There were five replications of each of the following categories: semi-natural forests, clearcuts, and managed forests (clearcut 70-120 years ago). Clearcutting seems to induce a long lasting effect on the Mycetophilidae fauna. The semi-natural forests were more species-rich and contained more 'potentially rare' species than the two other categories. Even though managed forests and clearcuts differed in faunal composition, their species richness was not significantly different. Continuity is probably a main factor for maintaining the diversity of Mycetophilidae species. Lumping the 15 sites together, the number of species was strongly correlated with the (temporal) continuity of tree cover and substrates, which may reflect an increased diversity of fungal habitats both in dead wood and on the ground. The degree of continuity was recognized by means of indicator species of fungi, lichen and vascular plants. The amount of dead wood was correlated with the species diversity, but was probably dependent on the continuity factor, since clearcuts with much dead wood had relatively fewer species.        Important elements in a strategy for conservation of the diversity of mycetophilid species seem to be: (i) to identify and protect the remnant patches of forests with long continuity, (ii) as far as possible, to practice timber harvesting in earlier clearcut forests instead of semi-natural forests.

AB  - Domestic livestock drives ecosystem changes in many of the world's mountain regions, and can be the dominant influence on soil, habitat and wildlife dynamics. Grazing impacts on ecosystem services (ES) vary according to densities of sheep, but an ES framework accounting for these is lacking. We devised an experiment to evaluate synergies and trade-offs of ESs and components of biodiversity affected by sheep density at the alpine landscape scale in southern Norway. We examined the effects of increased (80 per km(2)), decreased (0 per km(2)) and maintained sheep densities (25 per km(2)) on 'supporting', 'regulating' and 'provisioning' services and biodiversity (plants, invertebrates and birds). Overall, I and biodiversity were highest at maintained sheep density. Regulating services, including carbon storage and habitat openness, were particularly favoured by maintained densities of sheep. There was no overall decline in ESs from maintained to increased sheep densities, but several services, such as runoff water quality, plant productivity and carbon storage, declined when grazing increased. Our study provides experimental evidence for a positive effect of grazing on ES, but only at maintained low sheep densities. By identifying ES and biodiversity components that are traded-off at decreased and increased grazing, our study also demonstrates some of the negative impacts on ecosystems that can occur in mountain regions if management does not regulate herbivore densities.

AB  - The increasing demand for biofuel may decrease the dead wood supply in managed forests, and hence the amount of substrate available for dead wood dependent species. Slash is already being harvested for biofuel purposes, and stumps are an even bigger potential source of wood fuel. Both substrates constitute a major component of dead wood in man aged forests, but have been poorly studied in terms of lichen diversity. We compared lichen species diversity between the lateral surface of slash and the cut surface of stumps of Norway spruce in planted boreonemoral Swedish forests of four age classes; 4 - 5, 8 - 9, 12 - 13, and 16 - 18 years. We also estimated the amounts of the two substrates, and discriminated between slash with bark and decorticated slash. There were no differences in species num ber per surface area, but slash had more species when equal volumes were compared. We found compositional differences between slash and stumps throughout the decay process. The majority of species found on both substrates were more frequent on stumps, which also had a higher number of unique species and species in the literature indicated as nationally rare or uncommon. The volume per hectare of stumps was ten times greater than that of slash but conversely, the lateral surface area of slash was five times greater than the cut surface area of stumps. Few dead wood specialist lichen species were, however, strictly associated with slash, whereas stumps offer a more heterogeneous environment and may provide important habitats for rare lichens in the managed forest landscape.

AB  - European anthropogenic coastal heathlands are threatened by the cessation of traditional management practices. Fire has a long history in the management of this landscape, and its effect on various species groups has been investigated in previous studies. However, the resolution of these studies is generally rather coarse and is biased towards plants. In this study, we investigate the species diversity and composition of carabid beetles over a 22-year chronosequence of time since last fire in a coastal heathland in western Norway. We show that burning increases alpha species richness, and is particularly important for the richness of typical open habitat species. Our results also show that there are clear compositional differences between assemblages along the chronosequence, supporting the value for landscape scale biodiversity of rotational burning. Species richness is also increased by a higher species turnover between consecutive years in patches that have been burnt recently as compared to patches that have not been burnt for a long time. We conclude that burning is important in maintaining carabid diversity in anthropogenic heaths, and that prescribed burns should aim to create a mosaic of different burn years, preferably with a bias toward younger stages.

AB  - The effects of three forest management alternatives on stand development were simulated using the MOTTI stand simulator, a stand-level analysis tool developed for multiple-purpose forestry planning. The simulation results were used to analyse the effects of different management schedules on wood production, profitability, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Stand data from a 35-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stand with a deciduous admixture were used as the starting point. Stand development was simulated for a period of 35 years, and additionally for 65 years for biodiversity analyses. The three management alternatives were-(1) pure spruce stand: two commercial thinnings with removal of deciduous admixture, regeneration at 70 years, goal to maximize wood production; (2) mixed stand: as the previous one, but the deciduous admixture was maintained throughout the rotation, goal to enhance biodiversity; (3) unmanaged: no treatments.        The pure and mixed alternatives including commercial thinnings outperformed the unmanaged one both in the production of merchantable wood and in profitability (value of standing stock for the unmanaged alternative), but did not notably differ from each other. Carbon sequestration was directly proportional to biomass production and thus highest in the unmanaged alternative. The mixed stand had a 50%, and unmanaged stand 88% higher species richness than the pure stand at the age of 70 years. Prolonging the rotation to 100 years also considerably increased the species richness. The applicability of the results and use of the MOTTI simulator in forestry planning are discussed.

AB  - Sufficient genetic diversity can aid populations to persist in dynamic and fragmented environments. Understanding which mechanisms regulate genetic diversity of riverine fish can therefore advance current conservation strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate how habitat fragmentation interacted with population genetic diversity and individual behaviour of freshwater fish in large river systems. We studied a population of the long-distance migratory, iteroparous freshwater salmonid European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in south-eastern Norway. Genotyping (n = 527) and radio-tracking (n = 54) of adult fish throughout a 169-km river section revealed three major migration barriers limiting gene flow and depleting genetic diversity upstream. Individuals from upstream areas that had dispersed downstream of barriers showed different movement behaviour than local genotypes. No natal philopatry was found in a large unfragmented river section, in contrast to strong fidelity to spawning tributaries known for individuals overwintering in lakes. We conclude that (a) upstream sub-populations in fragmented rivers show less genetic variation, making it less likely for them to adapt to environmental changes; (b) fish with distinct genotypes in the same habitat can differ in their behaviour; (c) spawning site selection (natal philopatry) can differ between fish of the same species living in different habitats. Together this implies that habitat loss and fragmentation may differently affect individual fish of the same species if they live in different types or sections of habitat. Studying behaviour and genetic diversity of fish can unravel their complex ecology and help minimize human impact.

AB  - The mineralization of carbon and nutrients by the decomposing fungi and bacteria has an essential role in the ecosystem functioning. Strong correlations between soil fertility, plant nutrient uptake and primary productivity also make the soil processes important with respect of the land use. I have studied the effect of reindeer grazing on the soil processes in northern-boreal forests and arctic tundra heaths in several sites in northern Finland and Norway. I have compared the effect of grazing in different vegetation types and in areas of different grazing intensity. In boreal forests reindeer grazing retards carbon mineralization in both lichen- and dwarf-shrub dominated forests. In lichen-dominated forests, however, reindeer grazing enhances nitrogen mineralization, depending on soil moisture and weather conditions, as during dry summers the low soil moisture content may limit the microbial activity. Nutrient mineralization may therefore be enhanced or retarded by reindeer grazing and this may vary in different years. In arctic tundra heaths, the effect of reindeer grazing depends on the vegetation and the soil carbon storage. Reindeer grazing enhanced carbon mineralization in sub-oceanic, dwarf-shrub dominated tundra heaths, whereas it did not affect it in sub-continental, lichen dominated tundra heaths. Soil nitrogen availability was nevertheless improved by reindeer grazing in both vegetation types. In another arctic study area, however, carbon mineralization and microbial biomass was decreased by grazing. This was interpreted to depend on small carbon storage in soil.

AB  - This study compares the succession of understorey vegetation at semi-natural and managed mesic sites dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The area concerned is situated in the middle boreal forest zone on both sides of the border between Finland and Russia. The data were collected at 39 sites representing open/burned, sapling, young, mature and over-mature/old-growth forests. The coverage and number of species representing ground lichens, mosses, liverworts, grasses, herbs, dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings were recorded and analysed separately. The vegetation represented different stages of the succession and management history (managed versus semi-natural).        The vegetation was ordered along two multivariate (DCA) axes, the first related to successional stage and the second to human influence. The total number of plant species was dependent on the successional stage and the diversity pattern was similar both after semi-natural and man-made disturbance. The plant life-form groups exhibited specific patterns in their occurrence and in their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The coverage of grasses and dwarf shrubs, in particular, followed quite different patterns after man-made and natural disturbances. Grasses were abundant in managed forests after clear-cutting, but almost absent from young natural forests, while dwarf shrubs occurred more commonly in the old managed forests than in the younger ones. The coverage of seedlings in semi-natural forests peaked in the sapling stage, decreased towards the mature stage and increased again in the old-growth stage, while tree recruitment was relatively low in the older managed successional stages. The results highlight especially the characteristic vegetation features of young natural forests, which differ considerably from the corresponding managed forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ley cultivation by ploughing and fertilising constitute a severe impact on plant community patterns in semi-natural subalpine communities. Since the 1950ties, such cultivation have been an important part of the agroecosystem in subalpine areas in Norway, and regularly practised. Today, several former leys are left for grazing management. Plant species diversity and heterogeneity was studied in subalpine grasslands in Valdres, southern Norway (ca. 950 m a.s.l.) at different successional phases after ploughing. Fourteen sites (100 m(2)) varying from recently ploughed grasslands (3-5 years at phase 1) to unploughed sites were used to construct a temporal gradient by a space for time substitution. Small-scale species diversity (0.25 m(2)) of vascular plants increased continuously with the time since last ploughing, while the variation in gamma-diversity was minor among late successional phases 3-5 (> 23-28 years, 32-39 years and unploughed sites) after an evident increase from phase 1-3. The number of exclusive species peaked within unploughed sites (10), and included perennial herbs (Antennaria alpina, Hieracium auricula, Viola canina), spore-producing species (Botrychium lunaria, Selaginella selaginoides) and woody life-forms. Species diversity of cryptogams was low at both a small and large scale within successional phases 1 and 2 (< 12 years). Small scale cryptogam diversity peaked at the unploughed sites, while gamma diversity peaked at phase 3 (23-28 years). This intermediate phase 3 also had the highest number of exclusive species (12) which exceeded unploughed sites (8). A coarse spatial structure of cryptogams at phase 3 was indicated by a low mean of species distribution. The soil of uncultivated grasslands (phase 5) was, at the end of the growing season (mid August), quite base-rich with a higher content for all measured nutrients as compared to intermediate phases of continuity (phase 3 and 4) The exception was nitrate which was not detectable from phase 3 to 5, and available phosphate which peaked at an intermediate phase of succession (phase 3 and 4). Heterogeneity of vascular plants reached a minimum value at the intermediate phase (3) while cryptogam heterogeneity peaked at this phase. Differences in heterogeneity cycles among these species groups implies that structuring processes act on different temporal scales for vascular plants as compered to cryptogams along the successional gradient in grasslands after ploughing. The importance of continuity in management for plant biodiversity in subalpine grasslands is finally discussed from a conservation point of view.

AB  - Higher plant species richness has been proposed to increase the resilience of plant communities to disturbance. The purpose of this Study was to test whether this is true for reindeer grazed arctic tundra vegetation. Plant biomass, plant community structure, and species richness were measured along four fences that separated areas grazed by reindeer from ungrazed areas in northern Norway. I found a negative relationship between plant species richness and the change in species richness and biomass Clue to grazing. These results indicate diversity did not confer greater resilience to increased reindeer grazing intensity. No support for higher grazing pressure in diverse habitats were recorded, thus, these results suggest lower resilience to grazing in species-rich arctic tundra vegetation.

AB  - We compared diversity of birds in 35 study plots of equal size (58 ha) and productivity in western Norway, ranging from pure native pine Pinus sylvestris forests (n = 7), through different mosaics of native pine forests and spruce Picea spp. plantations (n = 21), to pure spruce plantations (n = 7). Diversity was evaluated by means of species richness, diversity indices, relative abundance curves and rarefaction. The diversity indices appeared to be less suitable for our purpose. Species richness was higher in pine forest than in spruce forest. However, a peak in species richness was found in mosaic forest. For pooled samples (408 ha), 11 bird species recorded in pine forest were not found in spruce forest, seven species were found in spruce forest but nor in pine forest, and seven species were confined to the medium mosaics of pine and spruce forest (on average 56% pine and 44% spruce). We argue that, when mixing two habitat types A and B, the ratio of these habitats that maximize avian diversity depends on the ratio of species confined to habitat A and B, as well as the number of species favoured by the mixture of A and B. Existing spruce plantations (13% of the area) in native pine forests of western Norway have reduced the diversity of birds locally, but increased the diversity of birds on the landscape and regional scale.

AB  - Veteran hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are keystone structures hosting high insect diversity but are declining in numbers due to intensification of land use and the abandonment of traditional management. The loss of this vital habitat is resulting in a reduction of biodiversity, and this likely has consequences for ecosystem functioning, especially if functional diversity is reduced. A considerable amount of research has been done on predictors of beetle taxonomic diversity in veteran oaks, but predictors of functional diversity have remained largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to establish whether the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are related to functional diversity within three functional groups of beetles (decomposers, predators, and flower visitors) and determine whether species richness and functional diversity within the groups are dependent on the same predictors. Sampling was carried out intermittently between 2004 and 2011 on 61 veteran oaks in Southern Norway. Of the 876 beetle species that were collected, 359 were determined to be decomposers, 284 were predators, and 85 were flower visitors. Species richness and functional diversity in all groups were consistently higher in traps mounted on veteran oaks in forests than in open landscapes. However, additional predictors differed between groups, and for species richness and functional diversity. Decomposer species richness responded to tree vitality, while functional diversity responded to habitat connectivity, predator species richness responded to regrowth of shrubs while functional diversity responded to tree circumference, and flower visitor richness and functional diversity did not respond to any additional predictors. Previous studies have found that the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are important for conservation of taxonomic diversity, and the results from this study indicate that they are also important for functional diversity within multiple functional groups.

AB  - Human disturbance in alpine habitats is expected to increase, and improved knowledge of short-term recovery after disturbance events is necessary to interpret vegetation responses and formulate planning and mitigation efforts. The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state.

AB  - Birch forests cover large areas of the northern Fennoscandia and the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) often forming the altitudinal and Arctic forest and tree lines. Interpreting the factors leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors. Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation data of biomass in the period 1957-2006, we were able to assess the transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957-2006. Only lichen biomass has been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The results presented in this paper show significant and positive relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer population in the period 1957-2006 in the study area. The hypothesis concerning the removal of the "lichen barrier effect" by heavy reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also, climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks, freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the period 1955-2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to the reduction of total net emission Of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover, reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The soil seed banks of three roadsides, one horsetrack, one stream verge and two agricultural fields were sampled in an agricultural landscape in southern Norway. Altogether 61 different vascular plant species germinated from soil samples from the five linear habitats, while only 16 species germinated from the agricultural fields. The low species number and low seed densities in the fields probably reflect modern weed management. Each linear habitat contained more or less specific subsets of plant species. The relative abundance of the different species exhibited an approximately log-normal distribution. Species composition in the seed banks of the linear habitats was compared with the aboveground vegetation. The seed bank had a higher frequency of annual species than the vegetation. Surveys restricted to the aboveground vegetation will tend to underestimate the number of species present by 15-30%.

AB  - Decline of dead wood in managed boreal forests has variously affected polypore species that use it as their substrate, some now being listed as threatened while some are still thriving. Management of polypore diversity requires species-specific information about their occurrence probabilities, which partially depend on stand dead wood availability and other properties.        We implemented an ensemble of polypore habitat models to simulations of stand and dead wood availability estimated with a decomposition model we fitted to data. We asked how management of a boreal Norway spruce stand influences the dead wood availability and polypore occurrence probabilities and their diversity.        Simulations of multiple polypore species with stand management scenarios provided insight to dead wood dynamics and polypore species management. In a managed stand, diversity thrived after final harvesting, but declined to low level by mid-rotation. Harvest residues and stumps, although low quality substrate for many species, were important for diversity in young managed stand due to their high quantities. High mixtures of naturalness in stand management were required to elevate diversity of managed spruce stands from the mid-rotation lows to levels in natural-like stands.        Our study suggests that dead-wood supply of managed stands could be optimised to lift lowest species expectations towards levels in natural-like forests, but it seems that reaching these levels requires deadwood quantities much higher than provided by conventional management. Management of stand diversity can presumably be facilitated with wise landscape planning but more research is needed in order to incorporate polypores to spatio-temporal management simulation context.

AB  - Conflicts over conservation are often regarded as dichotomies of diametrical opposites. When national parks are established in Norway, two stereotypes can be sketched: (1) the ecocentric position valuing 'pure, authentic nature', relying on the national government as the only acceptable decision and management level; and (2) a more anthropocentric position valuing cultural landscape elements and certain traditional and future uses of the area, favouring local management. A conflict over restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised comprehensive local debate. It is asked whether the relevant actors should be seen as situated in the stereotypes, or whether a more complex three-dimensional picture would provide a better interpretation.

AB  - We studied how different thinning regimes and initial age structures of a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest landscape affect the radiative forcing of forest biomass production and use. We considered the effects of forest carbon sequestration, substitution of materials and fossil fuels with forest biomass, and timber use efficiency. The initial age structures of our hypothetical forest landscapes in the middle boreal zone in Finland were young, middle-aged, and mature. Forest landscapes were thinned using either the current thinning recommendations (baseline) or maintaining 20% higher or 20% lower stocking over the 80-year study period. We employed forest ecosystem model simulations together with a life cycle assessment tool. The highest carbon sequestration was obtained by maintaining higher stocking in the landscapes. The initially middle-aged and mature age structures resulted in the strongest cooling of the climate in the first three decades of the simulation, but the highest cooling was found in the young age structure. However, radiative forcing was less sensitive to the thinning than to the substitution or timber use efficiency. Our results indicate that modeled climate impacts are affected by both initial age structure and forest management, which should be considered when generalizing the climate change mitigation potential of forests and forestry.

AB  - Uneven-aged forest management is suggested to be a sustainable management alternative in boreal forests, but knowledge on applicable harvest intensities is very limited as majority of the studies has focused on even-aged management practices. The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10-30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8-16 m(2) ha(-1)). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m(-2) a(-1) of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5-20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m(3) ha(-1) for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5-7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80-120 m(3) ha(-1) was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40-60 m(3) ha(-1). The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large herbivores can change ecosystem functioning by impacting plant diversity. However, although such impacts are expected to be scale-dependent in ecosystems with wide-roaming ungulates, scaling issues rarely enter empirical assessments. We here test the hypothesis that the impact of increased reindeer abundance on plant diversity in alpine tundra is scale-dependent. Based on potentially high productivity of the focal habitat units and hence the possibility of positive grazer impacts on plant diversity we predicted higher alpha and beta diversity at the habitat scale where reindeer densities are high. We also explored whether there were differences in diversity patterns at larger scales, including the scale of reindeer management districts. We estimated grazing disturbance as high versus low reindeer density in selected districts (a total extent of 7421 km(2)) of Northern Norway where reindeer-induced vegetation shifts are debated. We focus on dominance patterns because they can quantify the vegetation state and thus performed additive partitioning of Simpson diversity on multiple scales assessing also species' contributions to diversity. Contrary to our predictions, we found only weak scale-dependent effects of reindeer grazing on plant diversity. Under high reindeer densities there was evidence for a landscape-scale homogenization of the vegetation, but the predicted alpha and beta diversity increases at the habitat scale were not found. Consistently through all scales considered, four shrub species contributed the most to plant diversity. These results contradict the idea that reindeer at high stocking densities induce shifts in plant species dominance in productive habitats. We conclude that context-dependencies such as spatial scales of management units and habitat types need to be explicitly considered in evaluations of the impacts of large ungulates on plant diversity.

AB  - Questions: What are the effects of abandonment on plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands? Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil?        Location: West andmid-Norway.        Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect.        Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower.        Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.

AB  - The resolution of the Kyoto Protocol to include effects of land use and land-use change in global carbon budgets has put focus on C sequestration following afforestation of former arable land. Carbon is sequestered in the aggrading biomass of the new forests, but the question remains, to what extent the former arable soils will contribute as sinks for CO2. The present study explored changes in soil C stores following afforestation of former arable land with oak (Quercus robur L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Seven stands of each tree species on nutrient-rich soils made up a chronosequence ranging from 1 to 29 years. An adjacent similar to200-year-old mixed deciduous plantation was included to give information on the possible long term changes in soil C. Soil sampling included organic layers and three layers of the mineral soil to a depth of 25 cm.        Development of forest floors sequestered most C in spruce stands. While oak stands sequestered around 2 Mg C ha(-1), spruce stands sequestered approximately 9 Mg C ha(-1) in forest floors over 29 years. There were no differences between the two tree species in C concentration and storage of the three mineral soil layers. Carbon concentration and storage increased in the upper 5 cm of the mineral soil but decreased in the 5-15 and 15-25 cm soil layers with increasing stand age. The soil C store appeared to be undergoing redistribution following afforestation, and mineral soil C stores in 0-25 cm tended to decrease over the 29-year period. Together with the C sequestration of forest floors, this led to fairly similar total soil C stores of around 65 Mg ha(-1) along the 29-year chronosequence. Within this short time span, C sequestration mainly occurred in the biomass of trees while soil C stores were clearly higher in the similar to200-year-old plantation (81 Mg C ha(-1)). The ongoing redistribution of mineral soil C in the young stands and the higher soil C contents in the similar to200-year-old afforested stand suggest that nutrient-rich afforestation soils may become greater sinks for C in long term.

AB  - The influence of prescribed burning on ground beetles was studied in a single 12-ha stand that was partially clear-cut, selectively-cut and retained (= standing forest), and was compared to an unburned stand in 2002 in SE Norway. Thirty-two species were collected using Barber pitfall traps. Carabids were more numerous and more diverse in the burned area, compared to the unburned forest. Overall abundance was highest in the selectively-cut treatment, followed by the clear-cut and standing forest. Species diversity tended to increase in the sequence unburned forest - burned standing forest - burned selectively-cut - burned clearcut. Species composition differed little between the burned treatments. Pterostichus adstrictus, a species associated with open habitats and which frequently colonizes burned areas, was the most abundant species collected. It was most common in the burned area, particularly in the selectively-cut treatment. Our results suggest that burning of a single stand may support some carabid species, even endangered ones, although larger forest fires are probably more effective for conservation purposes.

AB  - Trade-offs exist among the multiple ecosystem services (ES) generated by forests. Generally, wood production conflicts with the provisioning of public-good ES such as the storage of carbon, nutrient retention and conservation of biodiversity. Recognizing that forests generate both private- and public-good ES implies that forestry should be optimized to maximize the contribution of forests to societal welfare. Here we develop an integrated approach for evaluating the contribution of forest ES to welfare. Our approach links the results from dynamic ecosystem modelling to economic valuation and benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the impacts of alternative forestry practices on welfare. We apply the approach to a Norway spruce forest in southern Sweden. We show that current practices are not maximizing societal welfare, because of conflicts in the optimal choice of practices from society's and forest owners' perspectives, and the distribution of welfare between generations. In particular, intensifying biomass production is shown to reduce welfare due to the concomitant degradation of public-good ES, while welfare would improve through expansion of continuous cover forestry. We anticipate that this type of approach will aid the sustainable development of forestry, by informing decision makers of the impacts of alternative forestry practices on societal welfare.

AB  - A chronosequence, representing a successional series, was used for the comparison of a hay meadow site managed in an old traditional way for at least a hundred years, and hay meadow sites abandoned for about 10, 20 and 30 years, respectively. Old traditional management included grazing early and late in the growing season, mowing in August and light or no fertilizing. The tree cover was the most important factor deciding the composition of vegetation. Time since abandonment was not completely correlated to tree cover, as some plots had a dense canopy and others were situated in the open. The total species number decreased with number of years since abandonment in plots > 0.001 m(2) and <100 m(2). The highest species number in I m2 plots was recorded in the managed site, with 38 species of phanerogams. Fourtyeight % of the indicators of traditional management present in the managed site was recorded in the site which had been abandoned for 30 years. Frequency - log area curves made it possible to group species according to persistence in the award. As a result, a group of functional indicators of rare hay meadows in the region was distinguished.

AB  - The beetle fauna of 299 sporocarps of the bracket fungus Fomitopsis pinicola in a 200 ha spruce forest in southeastern Norway was investigated in relation to sporocarp, tree and forest variables. The sporocarps contained 36 species of beetles, of which six species are on the Norwegian Red List. Of 12,373 individual beetles collected, 91% were Cis glabratus. Plots of species accumulation curves suggested that there may be more than 60 beetle species present in F. pinicola in the area, but that probably all the specialist Ciidae were found. The major factor influencing beetle diversity turned out to be the level of dead wood at and in the vicinity of the sampling site, with a higher number of species per unit volume of sporocarps in areas with high levels of dead wood. There were also significantly more red-listed species in those areas. Analysing the species occurrence with stepwise logistic regression, we show preferential habitat selection of the six most abundant species of Ciidae. Conservation of beetles associated with bracket fungi using amount of dead wood as a surrogate measurement is discussed.

AB  - Non-native tree species are widely used in forest plantations. This may have negative consequences for biodiversity. Hitherto, most studies have compared species diversity between native and non-native forest stands, which makes it difficult to separate the impact of tree species per se from stand characteristics. Our study, conducted in the south of Sweden, compares saproxylic beetle diversity across different nutritional groups, in dead wood of two native and four non-native tree species in a block design after one and three seasons. Such an approach allows analysis of the impact of non-native tree species per se. Mean species richness (+/- SD) per log was lower in non-native than in native tree species (non-native trees: lodgepole pine: 10.7 (+/- 5.3); Sitka spruce: 8.5 (+/- 4.3), Douglas fir: 7.1 (+/- 4.3), Japanese larch 9.4 (+/- 4.6); native trees: Norway spruce: 12.0 (+/- 6.0), Scots pine: 12.3 (+/- 5.2)). Sample-based rarefaction revealed that when only native tree species were pooled, the species richness was higher than for all tree species combined. The difference in species composition among tree species was strongly driven by bark and wood consumers in the first season, while for predators and fungivores, the differences were smaller. Species composition differed most in the first season. Dissimilarity in beetle species composition was positively correlated with phylogenetic distances of the tree species. Species richness was lower in non-native tree species that are only remotely related to native trees species. Of the studied non-native tree species, lodgepole pine was more closely related to native tree species and consistently harboured higher species richness. Synthesis and applications. Although non-native tree species also harbour saproxylic beetle communities, the use of non-native tree species, especially those only remotely related to native tree species, reduces local diversity of saproxylic beetles. Thus, for biodiversity conservation, an extensive use of non-native tree species is not recommended as this increases the risk of losing forest biodiversity, especially when they are only distantly related to native tree species.

AB  - Higher tree species richness often increases the diversity of other taxonomic groups and is promoted in many managed forest systems. The reason for the higher diversity is due to, for example, inter-specific differences in resource filtering of the trees. Resource filtering also depends on the total density of the tree layer, but the interaction between tree species composition and density is, so far, unexplored. Likewise, few studies have addressed whether mixtures of tree species host higher diversity, or support higher productivity, of other taxa than monocultures of the same tree species. We use a gradient in overstory tree species composition, ranging from pure Norway spruce (Picea abies) to pure Birch (Betula sp.), combined with a gradient from open to closed forest, to assess the joint effects of tree species mixture and forest density on the understory vegetation. The cover and species richness of understory vascular plants increased with an increasing proportion of birch and decreased with increasing forest density, while the cover of bryophytes decreased with an increasing proportion of birch and increasing forest density. There were clear interactions between tree species composition and forest density; the decrease in vascular plants with forest density was stronger in forest dominated by spruce than in forests dominated by birch, and the positive effect of an increasing proportion of birch was smaller in dense than in open forests. There were no indications of mixed forests supporting a higher species richness or plant cover than any of the two monocultures. Additionally, few species (10%) showed tendencies toward a higher probability of occurrence in mixed forests, and most of these also occurred in open pure stands. Our results indicate a potential conflict between goals for diversified forests and increased biomass production, as the positive effects for understory vegetation from mixtures may be lost to concomitant increases in forest density. Furthermore, the limited number of species benefiting from mixtures per se indicates that similar biodiversity benefits for understory vegetation may be obtained at landscape levels from the increased use of broadleaf and lower-density production stands, as from mixtures.

AB  - Species diversity and interactions vary on a landscape scale and are sensitive to landscape alterations, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat degradation. At the same time, the species position within food webs or mutualistic networks (e. g. generalist or specialist, network hub or peripheral vertex) may affect their ability to persist after perturbations. This study was conducted in a heavily managed boreal forest landscape in southeastern Norway, using study plots situated in forest stands with contrasting disturbance history: old growth forest (least disturbed), young forest (intermediate) and clear cuts (most disturbed). By studying 12 pollination networks with contrasting disturbance history we found that important network descriptors were conserved after perturbation. Link-diversity was higher, both overall and per site, in the more disturbed communities while link-turnover was highest in the least disturbed community. We conclude that despite an increase in diversity in the more degraded habitat, the higher link-turnover in the least degraded, old growth forest, community indicates a homogenization of the plant-pollinator networks as a result of habitat degradation. Finally, we found that the degree (number of interacting partners) and network functional role for particular species changed along the disturbance gradient, though not in any systematic way. We conclude that structural properties of the pollination network are conserved after perturbations, but that particular species' network functional roles may change.

AB  - Land management policies, which emphasize timber production and biodiversity conservation may neglect other important services that these landscapes provide, such as the recreational opportunities that are particularly important in urban forests and woodlands. The quality of recreational opportunities in forested lands is largely dictated by the degree of human influence on the landscape, including forestry, recreational facilities, infrastructure and other man-made constructions. We present a four-part conceptual model based on the recreation opportunity spectrum framework, and tested it by using survey data and automatic counters in urban forests of Oslomarka in Norway. We find empirical support for the four-part planning concept. The pragmatic model may inspire forest landowners, land managers and planners to envision potential contributions to recreational opportunities by identifying four broad categories of suitability for recreational activities labelled: general consideration-, special consideration-, service- and wilderness areas. The conceptual framework can be used as a tool to plan and manage for recreational opportunities at different spatial scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with study site averages ranging from 600 to 1400 km(2) for resident males and from 300 to 800 km(2) for resident females. When home range sizes were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be conserved in the multiuse seminatural forest habitats that cover large areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding, and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest). Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these conflicts, and finding solutions.

AB  - Multi-taxon analyses of ecological assemblages are needed when the effects of forestry on biodiversity are examined. Management usually simplifies the structure of forests, which results in quantitative and qualitative declines in many microhabitats and species associated with them. In Fennoscandia, most forests are managed for industrial use of wood, but relatively little is known about the relationships between structural components and biodiversity in managed forests. Abundance, composition or species number of different species groups reacting similarly to variation in their environment would be a useful tool e.g. in estimating responses of species that are more difficult to sample. Thus far evidence for, or the lack of, such congruence or indicator functioning is not conclusive. We therefore examined the associations between stand structural features and species diversity and congruence between species groups of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, polypores and beetles. Our study was carried out in mature managed Norway spruce dominated forests in Southern Finland in 2009. Our main findings were (1) cross-taxon congruence in species richness was generally low, suggesting that any single taxonomic group performed poorly as an indicator of overall biodiversity; (2) the volume and diversity of dead trees were the most frequently detected significant predictors of species richness of the studied groups; (3) in terms of species composition, only vascular plants co-varied significantly with bryophytes and lichens; in addition, bryophytes and lichens as well as polypores co-varied significantly with stand structural features; (4) species composition of vascular plants, polypores and saproxylic beetles was associated with the volume of living trees, and in polypores it was also associated with the volumes of both dead and living deciduous trees. These results suggest that biodiversity monitoring for management and conservation requires data from several taxa. However, the volume and diversity of dead wood are useful indicators of stand-level species richness of several taxa, whereas the volume of living trees is an important indicator for the stand-level species composition of several groups. Thus, these structural variables have the potential to function as easily attainable indicators of general forest biodiversity.

AB  - Rapid destruction of forest habitats has led to the establishment of protected areas in formerly managed forests with the aim of restoring biodiversity. Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi. We therefore suggest a conservation strategy for preserving old-growth forests and establishing protected forest stands to enhance structural heterogeneity in spruce-dominated forests. For this, a careful screening of protected areas throughout Europe is necessary to provide managers with guidelines for conservation.

AB  - The fauna of surface-active spiders was studied in 12 cereal fields, with two types of subcrop, and in four young (17 months old) perennial leys (grass/clover). The fields were located in the southeastern (A), central (B) and western (C) parts of Norway. In total, 3945 spiders were caught from May to September 2004, using pitfall traps. Linyphidae was the most numerous family, with Erigone atra Blackwall 1833 representing 56% of all trapped individuals. The total numbers of spider species and individuals were significantly higher in leys than in barley at sites where both crops were present (sites A and B), with on average 11 species and 93 specimens in barley, and 20 species and 393 specimens in leys. Thus, young perennial leys appeared to provide a better habitat for spiders than did cereal fields, as has previously been documented for older perennial leys. The use of multi-species crops instead of a single crop species undersown in cereals, tended to result in higher spider species diversity, but it did not influence the total number of specimens. An ordination (DCA) showed a clustering of the spider fauna from the same site, but no clear separation between main crop types (ley vs. barley) was apparent. The main crops, subcrops, and the surrounding environs of the cropped field seem to affect the diversity and abundance of spiders.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the effects of management on the production of timber and energy biomass, and ecosystem carbon balance in Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands, with impacts on carbon neutrality of the use of biomass in energy production. In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the primary environmental causes of biodiversity decline across scales; locally to globally. Ecological restoration is acknowledged as an important tool to counteract this negative trend. The semi-natural calcareous sand dune meadows in south-western Norway are known for their high species diversity, much like similar habitats of high conservation value across Europe today. The recent cessation of grazing has caused a decline in several endangered species associated with these habitats due to the advancement of secondary succession. We conducted a long-term restoration experiment in semi-natural dune meadows over 16 years to examine if current trends in biodiversity loss could be reversed and at what time-scale restoration measures take effect. Three treatments were applied; mowing annually, mowing bi-annually, and a control (no mowing). In fields mown annually species richness increased significantly over time. However, the response was slow and significant effects were first seen after year 10. Fields mown bi-annually also showed a similar trend but the response was more variable. Several characteristic meadow species were favoured by annual mowing while they declined in the control fields. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a compositional shift, indicating the re-arrangement/-establishment of typical meadow vegetation in the mown sites, contrasting the further successional development in the control. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term data in supporting good evidence-based management. Annual mowing is effectively restoring this unique habitat, but restoration efforts need to be sustained over many years to show positive effects.

AB  - In parallel with the current effects and responses to climate change ongoing changes of land use strongly affect alpine areas. The aim of this study was to analyse spider assemblages occurring on farmlands with differing stages of land use intensity. We collected the ground-dwelling spider fauna of semi-natural grasslands in currently farmed and abandoned farmland in the alpine zone of Hardangervidda, Norway, using pitfall traps. Trapping during the whole vegetation period resulted in 1,548 individuals belonging to 39 species of spiders. Linyphiids and lycosids dominated. The total number of species differ little between sites, but there was a general trend of increasing proportions of lycosids, gnaphosids and thomisids individuals and species, and a decrease in the proportion of linyphiids with farmland abandonment. Two main groupings of spider assemblages were found using a principal component analysis: One grouping was characteristic of intensely disturbed sites, mainly dominated by typical pioneer species. The other was characteristic of abandoned and less disturbed sites, dominated by widespread species. The abandonment of summer farms led to a succession in spider assemblages, including a decline in spider species with a high ballooning activity and an increase of species with a larger body size. We suggest that the main reason lies in the absence of disturbance by grazing including differing vegetation architecture and the proportion of bare ground with abandonment. Spider assemblages react quickly to environmental changes that occur in alpine habitats after abandonment. Thus, it is necessary to include spiders and other invertebrate animal indicator groups in field studies and experiments dealing with grazing impacts on alpine habitats.

AB  - Almost all productive Swedish forests have been managed for timber production for a long period of time. More sensitive so-called red-listed species are today restricted to small remnant habitats in a managed landscape matrix. It has been hypothesized that natural biodiversity can be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, blends natural structures and includes natural composition into the production forest. The most important restoration measures in Swedish boreal forests for promoting biodiversity are to increase the number and quality of undisturbed forests, the amounts of coarse woody debris, the number of deciduous trees, and to introduce fire as an ecological process.        On the basis of current knowledge of natural forest dynamics, we here present management options for three major site types in boreal Sweden which mimic natural dynamics better than traditional forestry. In the natural stages, the sites carried (1) Scots pine forest, (2) deciduous or Norway spruce dominated forest, and (3) Norway spruce forest regenerated by so-called gap dynamics, respectively.        The flora and fauna that characterize the first two, fire-influenced sites are considered relatively well-adapted to the kind of large-scale disturbances characterizing forestry. On these sites, therefore, the modifications proposed are within today's approach to applying the clear felling system. Sites that seldom experience fire may host species extremely sensitive to large-scale disturbances. If such sites are to be used for timber production, modified forestry practices using selection or shelterwood systems with relatively dense shelterwoods are suggested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Protected forest areas (PFAs) are key features of biodiversity conservation, and knowledge about long-term development is crucial in evaluating their efficiency and management needs. Longitudinal data on forest structure in PFAs is uncommon and often from small areas. Here we use data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to study changes in more than 750 000 ha of PFAs over 60 years. Structures important for biodiversity, e.g., number of large trees and the volume of hard deadwood, including both standing and down wood, have more than doubled. The initial volume of deadwood, however, was very low. The overall tree species composition was stable over time, and only among the largest trees were there indications of a shift towards the late successional Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Deadwood increased independent of species, size of wood, and site characteristics. This increase was positively related to the volume of living trees and forest age. We conclude that Swedish PFAs, in the absence of active management and under fire suppression at the landscape scale, develop structural components that are crucial for conservation of biodiversity. However, although tree species composition appears stable, present disturbance regimes in the PFAs are considerably different from those in naturally dynamic forests, which may have implications for long-term biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - This study integrates an ecological process-based growth model, economic description of forestry and derivative-free numerical optimization for analysing optimal management of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) stands in fertile southern Finland sites. The process-based growth model is built on fundamental ecological theories of photosynthesis, tree structure and competition between trees. Because of the sound theoretical basis the validity of the optimization results is not restricted to a limited set of states determined by the boundaries of empirical data. The detailed structure of the growth model enables the inclusion of timber quality and its dependence on the size and quality of branches. The optimized variables include the initial stand density, the number, type and intensity of thinnings and the rotation period. The results yield a detailed and coherent picture of optimal stand level management. Comparing the optimal solutions with silvicultural practices suggests that the latter are based on unoptimal thinnings, too low stand density and too long rotation periods. As a consequence a fraction of harvested trees contain too large dry branches and qualify only as low value pulpwood implying that the bare land value remains below 60% of its maximized level.

AB  - We studied the effects of different wood harvesting and utilisation policies on the carbon balance and economic profitability of forestry under the current and changing climate (A1B climate scenario). Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diversity in different groups of obligate saproxylic beetles was related to ecological variables at three levels of spatial scale in mature spruce-dominated forest. The variables were connected to: (i) decaying wood, (ii) wood-inhabiting fungi, (iii) the level of disturbance, (iv) landscape ecology, and (v) vegetational structure. Several strong relationships were found at medium (1 km(2)) and large scales (4 km(2)), while only weak relationships were found at a small scale (0.16 ha; 1 ha = 10(4) m(2)). This may be explained by the local variations in habitat parameters and the high mobilities of many beetle species. Factors connected to decaying wood and wood-inhabiting fungi were clearly the most important factors at all scale levels. In particular, the variables diversity of dead tree parts, number of dead trees of large diameter and number of polypore fungi species increased the species richness of many groups and increased the abundance of many species. Eight species were absent below a certain density of decaying wood per 1 or 4 km(2). Former extensive cutting was a negative factor at large scale, probably because of decreasing recolonization with increasing distance to the source habitats. Thinning reduced the diversity of species associated with birch. The development of guidelines favouring the diversity of saproxylic beetles are discussed below.

AB  - The Norwegain mountains have had a central role in the subsistence agroecosystems by providing vast biological resources for humans and their livestock since 4000-3500 BP as indicated by paleoecological records. Later with the development of the summer farming system the use of the mountains was intensified. This long-term use of the mountains has shaped a montane cultural landscape by livestock grazing, mowing for hay, fuel collection and a variety of other uses. The result is a significant increase of the grassland areas at the expense of the forest. Those semi-natural grasslands and heathlands with specific biological diversity have until recently dominated the mountains but are today decreasing due to forest invasion - which in turn is a result of changes in human land use. The present paper focuses on changes in landscape pattern and differences in landscape development in two mountain valleys with summer farming activities, in Mid-Norway, over the period 1960s-1990s, and seeks to interpret the changes in relation to differential land use and environmental factors. This study contributes examples from human shaped ecosystems in mountains where the fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is addressed. A set of landscape pattern indices commonly used in landscape ecological studies is also used here, and their ecological relevance in the present context is dealt with. The implications of changed land use for biodiversity conservation in those mountains and the relationships to future sustainable agriculture is also briefly discussed.

AB  - Herbivory is one of the most important biotic disturbance types globally and is important for community structure and composition through species filtering. In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Colonisation is often a critical stage in the life history of plants, and recruitment success is expected to have a strong impact on plant frequencies especially among herbs. Several plant traits (seed size, plant height, leaf dry weight and specific leaf area) are suggested to be functionally important in early life stages, and the impact of such traits is expected to increase with habitat harshness. In this comparative study we examine the relative role of different plant traits for herb community patterns on both a local and regional scale in two contrasting alpine ecosystems in southern Norway: (1) a sub-continental region with more dry and productive, base-rich soils (Hol, Hallingdal) and (2) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal). Differences in species richness between regions were mainly due to higher herb richness in the base-rich region (n=55) than in the acidic region (n=13). Among traits, herb species seed weight was higher at the acidic site. The relative importance of traits for explaining herb local abundance and regional distribution tended to be stronger at the acidic site. No trait had a significant effect at the base-rich site, although seed weight and seed number were marginally non-significant. Plant clonality was positively related to local abundance and marginally to regional distribution at the acidic site. Plant frequency-trait correlations were generally higher in the acidic region then in the base-rich region. There was further a (marginal) increase of herbs with large seeds and with a dependence on sexual reproduction with increasing pH levels in Hol. Soil pH was also the most important environmental variable for herb richness in Hol, while no environmental variable was significantly related to herb richness in Setesdal. The study suggests that recruitment through seed is critical for the alpine herb community patterns especially in harsh habitats. Possible explanations for recruitment constraints include both soil acidity (low pH and Ca levels in addition to possible aluminium toxicity) and disturbance through grazing.

AB  - Slope aspect modifies microclimate and influences ecological processes and spatial distribution of species across forest landscapes, but the impact of slope aspect on community responses to disturbance is poorly understood. Such insight is necessary to understand landscape community dynamics and resilience. We compared bryophyte (liverworts and mosses) communities in matched 0.02-ha plots of four boreal stand types in central Sweden: recently clear-felled and mature stands dominated by Norway spruce in south-facing and north-facing slopes. Differences between forests and clear-cuts were interpreted as effects of clear-cutting, and differences between south- and north-facing slopes as effects of aspect. In response to clear-cutting, bryophyte cover and composition changed more in south-facing slopes. Only one out of ten significantly declining species in south- facing slopes also declined significantly in north-facing slopes. North-facing slopes lost fewer bryophyte species, and among those, fewer forest species and fewer species associated with wood and bark. In north-facing slopes, the average proportions of mosses and liverworts shared between the forest and the clear-cut plot were 88% and 74%, respectively. Corresponding numbers for south- facing slopes were 79% and 33%. In addition, more bryophyte species were added in north-than south- facing slopes after clear-cutting, somewhat reducing the difference in compositional change between aspects. South- and north-facing mature forests differed in species composition, mostly due to higher richness of mosses in south- facing slopes. The smaller changes in bryophyte communities on north-facing slopes in response to clear- cutting have implications for ecosystem dynamics and management as high local survival may enhance landscape-level resilience.

AB  - Context The variation in spatial distribution between ecosystem services can be high. Hence, there is a need to spatially identify important sites for conservation planning. The term 'ecosystem service hotspot' has often been used for this purpose, but definitions of this term are ambiguous.        Objectives We review and classify methods to spatially delineate hotspots. We test how spatial configuration of hotspots for a set of ecosystem services differs depending on the applied method. We compare the outcomes to a heuristic site prioritisation approach (Marxan).        Methods The four tested hotspot methods are top richest cells, spatial clustering, intensity, and richness. In a conservation scenario we set a target of conserving 10 % of the quantity of five regulating and cultural services for the forest area of Telemark county, Norway.        Results Spatial configuration of selected areas as retrieved by the four hotspots and Marxan differed considerably. Pairwise comparisons were at the lower end of the scale of the Kappa statistic (0.11-0.27). The outcomes also differed considerably in mean target achievement, cost-effectiveness in terms of land-area needed per unit target achievement and compactness in terms of edge-to-area ratio.        Conclusions An ecosystem service hotspot can refer to either areas containing high values of one service or areas with multiple services. Differences in spatial configuration among hotspot methods can lead to uncertainties for decision-making. This also has consequences for analysing the spatial co-occurrence of hotspots of multiple services and of services and biodiversity.

AB  - An international overview of the extent and type of ecological restoration can offer new perspectives for understanding, planning, and implementation. The Nordic countries, with a great range of natural conditions but historically similar social and political structures, provide an opportunity to compare restoration approaches and efforts across borders. The aim of this study was to explore variation in ecological restoration using the Nordic countries as an example. We used recent national assessments and expert evaluations of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts differed among countries: forest and peatland restoration was most common in Finland, freshwater restoration was most common in Sweden, restoration of natural heathlands and grasslands was most common in Iceland, restoration of natural and semi-cultural heathlands was most common in Norway, and restoration of cultural ecosystems, mainly abandoned agricultural land, was most common in Denmark. Ecological restoration currently does not occur on the Faroe Islands. Economic incentives influence ecological restoration and depend on laws and policies in each country. Our analyses suggest that habitat types determine the methods of ecological restoration, whereas socio-economic drivers are more important for the decisions concerning the timing and location of restoration. To improve the understanding, planning, and implementation of ecological restoration, we advocate increased cooperation and knowledge sharing across disciplines and among countries, both in the Nordic countries and internationally. An obvious advantage of such cooperation is that a wider range of experiences from different habitats and different socio-economic conditions becomes available and thus provides a more solid basis for developing practical solutions for restoration methods and policies.

AB  - Forestry practices that aim to increase biomass production may mitigate climate change through increased carbon sequestration and the potential of substituting fossil fuels with renewable biofuels. Fertilising young stands of Norway spruce in Sweden have shown to increase tree growth by more than 200%. Fertilisation, however, also has other effects on forest ecosystems. Here, we studied the response of the species composition of forest-floor vegetation to three different frequencies of fertilisation in young stands of Norway spruce. Fertiliser was applied every year, every second year or every third year. The total amount of N ranged from 425 kg ha(-1) to 625 kg ha(-1), in combination with P, K. Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Zi, B and Cu. The largest effects of the fertilisation were found among bryophytes and lichens, which lost substantial cover. Unexpectedly, Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly known to be favoured by fertilisation, was negatively affected. Species that increased in frequency were Oxalis acetosella, Brachythecium sp. and Plagiothecium sp. Decreased availability of light, as an indirect effect of fertilisation through increased tree canopy cover, was found to be the most important factor behind the change in species composition of vascular plants. The total cover of bryophytes, however, did not show any significant response to the changes in canopy cover, indicating that the effects seen in this group may be a result of more direct effects of the fertiliser. Few significant differences were found between the two most intensive fertilisation frequencies, although fertilisation every third year was often distinguished from both the control and the other fertilised treatments. Even though the effects at the stand level were substantial, the effects on biodiversity and function of ecosystems on a landscape or regional level need further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European pine marten Martes martes is often associated with late seral stage coniferous forest stands. Earlier research has indicated that this species may be negatively influenced by clearcutting practices. However, the effects of current clearcutting methods on pine marten occurrence in conjunction with changing environmental conditions are not well known. In this study, we combined four complete years of nationwide data collected during a long-term camera trap (CT) monitoring program in Norway. We employed a multi-scale occupancy model to investigate the relationship of pine marten occurrence to clearcuts (regenerating stands & LE; 10 years old) and forests & GE; 120 years old. We also examined pine marten detection in relation to habitat features (i.e. dominant microsite characteristics) and to varying snow depths and temperatures. We found no relationship between pine marten occurrence and the proportions of old forest and clearcuts at the landscape scale. At the habitat-patch scale, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with the presence of old forest patches and terrain ruggedness, but not with clearcuts & LE; 100 m from sites. At CT sites near clearcuts, the detection probability was negatively correlated with snow depth. In contrast, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with snow depth at CT sites > 100 m from clearcuts. Furthermore, the detection probability increased with temperature and the presence of boulders at CT sites. Boulders may provide important access points for foraging, and cover for resting and predator avoidance. While previous studies indicate that pine martens prefer older forest and avoid clearcuts, the current level and scale of clearcutting in Norway does not appear to influence its occurrence at the landscape scale.

AB  - Power line clearings are edge-creating disturbances in landscapes world-wide, but there have been few studies on their bordering vegetation. Our aim was to quantify edge effects on plant communities along such clearings in Norway and to identify factors that influence these edge effects. We surveyed understorey plant communities on either side of the power line clearing-forest edge at 51 sites, along four parallel transects at each site. Each transect had four plots located, respectively, in the clearing centre, clearing edge, forest edge and forest. We quantified the magnitude of edge effects (MEE) on either side by comparing edges with their corresponding non-edge' reference habitats. We also measured differences in species composition across the edge (clearing edge vs. forest edge). Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. Differences in species composition were greater between clearing centres and clearing edges than between forests and forest edges. Differences in species composition across the edge increased with edge contrast and forest productivity. Edge effects on species composition into the forest were smallest along north-facing edges, whereas those in the clearings increased with power line age. Species richness increased slightly towards the edge in forests but decreased considerably towards the edge in clearings. The direction and MEE on either side differed among functional groups. Edge contrast and edge aspect were the prime factors influencing the MEE into forests, whereas in clearings, these were influenced principally by tree regrowth in the clearings and by forest productivity.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects on plant communities bordering power line clearings were determined by factors that can be influenced by planners and managers. For existing power lines, management plans should differentiate between the following: (i) clearings through high conservation value forests, where edge effects into the adjacent forest should be limited; (ii) clearings that can act as replacement habitat for cultural landscape species, where maintaining open-canopy habitats should be prioritized; and (iii) business-as-usual' clearings, where continuing the current practice of cutting every 5-10years is recommended.

AB  - The greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of European grasslands (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland), including CO2, CH4 and N2O, is estimated using the new process-based biogeochemical model ORCHIDEE-GM over the period 1961-2010. The model includes the following: (1) a mechanistic representation of the spatial distribution of management practice; (2) management intensity, going from intensively to extensively managed; (3) gridded simulation of the carbon balance at ecosystem and farm scale; and (4) gridded simulation of N2O and CH4 emissions by fertilized grassland soils and livestock. The external drivers of the model are changing animal numbers, nitrogen fertilization and deposition, land-use change, and variable CO2 and climate. The carbon balance of European grassland (NBP) is estimated to be a net sink of 15 +/- 7gCm(-2)year(-1) during 1961-2010, equivalent to a 50-year continental cumulative soil carbon sequestration of 1.0 +/- 0.4PgC. At the farm scale, which includes both ecosystem CO2 fluxes and CO2 emissions from the digestion of harvested forage, the net C balance is roughly halved, down to a small sink, or nearly neutral flux of 8gCm(-2)year(-1). Adding CH4 and N2O emissions to net ecosystem exchange to define the ecosystem-scale GHG balance, we found that grasslands remain a net GHG sink of 19 +/- 10g C-CO2 equiv. m(-2)year(-1), because the CO2 sink offsets N2O and grazing animal CH4 emissions. However, when considering the farm scale, the GHG balance (NGB) becomes a net GHG source of -50gC-CO2 equiv. m(-2)year(-1). ORCHIDEE-GM simulated an increase in European grassland NBP during the last five decades. This enhanced NBP reflects the combination of a positive trend of net primary production due to CO2, climate and nitrogen fertilization and the diminishing requirement for grass forage due to the Europe-wide reduction in livestock numbers.

AB  - During the last century the boreal forests of south-eastern Norway have been converted into patchworks of agricultural areas, clear-cuts and even-aged conifer monocultures. Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics.        At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals.        Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity.        Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals.        Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are often defined by their dominant foundation tree species, which dictate forest structure and ecosystem processes. In southern Sweden, concerns are being raised because production stands of a foundation tree species, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), are being converted to Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Such conversions may lead to biodiversity loss, though the specific nature and extent of such losses remain unknown. Here, we assess the potential biodiversity impacts by contrasting the bird communities of 55- and 80-year-old Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. We also determine the extent to which these production stands capture the available species pool by surveying conifer-dominated reserves. Our results indicate that Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests support overlapping but nevertheless distinct bird communities, though only few recordings were made of the species unique to either stand type. Among the production stands, the 80-year spruce stands had the highest average bird species richness, and largest total number of species recorded. We suggest that the higher diversity can be explained by a higher proportion of broadleaves and higher volumes of dead wood. Although the bird diversity found in the reserves was lower than expected, they benefit gamma diversity at landscape scales as they collectively supported a higher diversity of bird species than the production forests. In summary, the conversion of Scots pine to Norway spruce is likely to increase the homogeneity of the bird communities in this region.

AB  - 290 lichen taxa were recorded in 110 spruce forest stands of different successional stages in a suboceanic area of central Norway. Mean species number increased from young to older stands, but with no difference between the two oldest cutting classes. A positive correlation was found between species number and forest stand area, less pronounced for the oldest cutting class. Several species were found to be consistently most frequent in the old growth stands and were considered old growth or mature forest species. Old growth species could be grouped in ecological entities of which 'dry bark species' (on old Picea trunks) and 'snag species' were the most important. A number of species showed preference for specific vegetation types with more species preferring nutrient poor stands compared to nutrient rich stands. Cyanobacterial lichens were generally less common in the old growth stands compared to intermediate stands and preferred the nutrient rich vegetation types. Some considerations for conservation and management of lichens are presented. Floristic and/or taxonomic notes on a number of species are given. Ochrolechia juvenalis and Xylographa trunciseda are reported as new to Europe and Norway respectively.

AB  - This study investigated the importance of habitat quality and habitat heterogeneity for the abundance and diversity of breeding birds in continuous forest and in forest fragments surrounded by farmland in central Sweden. Positive correlations were found between species number and area, volume of Aspen Populus tremula and habitat heterogeneity. Spatial segregation of habitats at a relatively fine-grained scale is suggested to allow for the co-occurrence of more species. The abundance of at least 18 of the species in this study was influenced by fragmentation, and nine of these species preferred fragments to forest sites. The total density of virus was higher in fragments than in forest sites, probably because several fragment species forage in farmland surrounding the sites and a few also forage at edges. Nine species were more common in forest sites than in fragments, but only one species was restricted to continuous forest. However, several fragments were relatively close to forests (150 m) and forest was common in larger scale contexts. The abundance of most species (25 of 33 species) in this study was correlated with habitat quality variables (i.e. variables measuring the size, volume and diversity of 'tree species'). Among these habitat variables the most important tons the occurrence of deciduous trees which seemed to be important for 14 species. The second most important habitat factor seemed to be the diameter of trees, which was positively correlated with the abundance of eight species of which five are hole-nesters. Among coniferous trees, six species were positively correlated with the volume of Norway Spruce Picea abies, whereas no species seemed to be correlated with the volume of Pine Pinus sylvestris.

AB  - Whereas there is evidence that mixed-species approaches to production forestry in general can provide positive outcomes relative to monocultures, it is less clear to what extent multiple benefits can be derived from specific mixed-species alternatives. To provide such insights requires evaluations of an encompassing suite of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and forest management considerations provided by specific mixtures and monocultures within a region. Here, we conduct such an assessment in Sweden by contrasting even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies)-dominated stands, with mixed-species stands of spruce and birch (Betula pendula or B. pubescens), or spruce and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). By synthesizing the available evidence, we identify positive outcomes from mixtures including increased biodiversity, water quality, esthetic and recreational values, as well as reduced stand vulnerability to pest and pathogen damage. However, some uncertainties and risks were projected to increase, highlighting the importance of conducting comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluations when assessing the pros and cons of mixtures.

AB  - 1. Population-level management is difficult to achieve if wildlife routinely crosses administrative boundaries, as is particularly frequent for migratory populations. However, the degree of mismatch between management units and scales at which ecological processes operate has rarely been quantified. Such insight is vital for delimiting functional population units of partially migratory species common in northern forest ecosystems.        2. We combined an extensive dataset of 412 GPS-marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) across Norway with information on the size and borders of two administrative levels, the governmental level (municipality) and landowner level (local management units, LMUs), to determine the timing and scale of mismatch between animal space use and management units. We analysed how landscape characteristics affected the use of management units and the timing and likelihood of crossing borders between them, in an effort to delineate more appropriate units in various landscapes.        3. Median municipality size could potentially cover 70% of female and 62% of male annual ranges, while only 12% and 4% of LMUs were expansive enough to accommodate migratory routes in females and males, respectively. Red deer migrate along elevational gradients and are more likely to find both suitable lowland winter habitat and higher summer habitat within management units with variable topography. Consistent with this, the likelihood of border crossing decreased with increasing diversity of elevations.        4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a considerable mismatch between animal space use and management units. Far-ranging movements and frequent administrative border crossings during autumn migration coincides with the period of active management (hunting season). Our study also highlights that, due to extensive movements of males, coordination of management aims may provide a more realistic avenue than increasing sizes of local management units. A more general insight is that the degree of mismatch between range use and management units depends on the season and landscape type. This needs to be accounted for when delimitating functional population units of migratory populations.        We demonstrate a considerable mismatch between animal space use and management units.

AB  - We studied four south-facing and three north-facing boreal spruce forest stands (ca. 0.1 ha each) in SE Norway with the aim of testing the hypothesis that former logging has long-term effects on boreal forest-floor vegetation. The stand series comprised unlogged natural forests and forests that were selectively or clear cut 60-70 years prior to our study. Each stand was described with respect to history of forestry impact and tree-stand structure. Environmental, species number, species abundance and species composition (vegetation gradients obtained as ordination axes) variables obtained for 25 m x 1 m plots in each stand were tested for among-stand differences.        Significant among-stand differences were found, partly related to former forest management and partly,due to among-stand differences in topography. Differences among stands related,to management were found for tree stand density, highest in managed stands, and for Dryopteris expansa agg. and Luzula pilosa abundances, peaking in formerly clear-cut stands. Species number (at plot or stand scales) was weakly related to former management. On southerly as well as northerly aspects, gradients in species composition were found that separated plots according to former management. Differences among stand conditioned on topography resulted in opposite patterns in the two series of stands because among southerly stands the clear cut was the least while among northerly the clear cut was the most strongly sloping. Low-inclination sites tended more strongly to be paludified and to have high Sphagnum cover, and to have low abundance of specific microsites with small mosses and hepatics. Vegetation gradients related to soil moisture and microtopography were found for both aspects.        A strong gradient in species composition related to tree influence at within-stand scales was found, with variation in species number. Existence of such a gradient should provide for significant biotic effects (of short or long duration) of the environmental changes that take place during forest re-growth: (1) the immediate creation of small or large tree-layer gaps by tree felling; and (2) the closing of the tree layer during the regeneration phase. Most notably, the phases at which the tree layer reaches minimum and maximum cover, respectively, may act as 'bottlenecks' for survival of forest-floor species.        We conclude that forestry impacts understorey vegetation by way of changes. in tree-layer structure and, to a lesser extent, substrate availability and the local environment, during forest regrowth. The extent and duration of this impact will depend on a complex set of factors. Our results are consistent with the view that if maintenance of species diversity is aimed at, environmental considerations should be built into forest management practices, preferably by mimicking the natural structural dynamics of the tree layer.

AB  - Supplementary, or diversionary feeding of wildlife is a common management practice, increasingly used to reduce or divert herbivore impact from sensitive habitats, forestry or agriculture. The landscape-scale spatial distribution of herbivory in relation to diversionary feeding is relevant to wildlife and land management, yet has never been quantified. We considered multiple hypotheses, based on central-place foraging theory, to investigate how landscape-scale browsing impact changed as a function of distance from feeding stations and thereby test the effectiveness of diversionary feeding. We assessed the landscape-scale browsing impact of moose by quantifying browsing patterns and moose density in commercially-valuable young Scots pine stands in an area of South-East Norway with a long history of winter feeding. We also used positions from GPS-collared female moose to investigate the spatial distribution of individuals across the landscape. Moose density and browsing impact at the local spatial scale (<1 km) followed an exponential decrease with distance from diversionary feeding stations. However, at the landscape scale (1-10 km), browsing impact did not show any relationship with distance to feeding stations. Leader stem browsing on Scots pine trees was high at both the local (68 +/- 12%) and landscape (59 +/- 8%) scales. In addition, browsing on commercially valuable Norway spruce, which is normally avoided by moose, was locally high around feeding stations. Long-term diversionary feeding of moose is ineffective in diverting browsing impact from young pine stands at the landscape scale, as currently practiced. Browsing on commercially-important tree species was sufficiently high that economic consequences could be expected. To avoid further conflict, we suggest a combination of reducing moose density and increasing the availability of natural or higher quality supplementary forage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An ecosystem model (Sima) was utilised to investigate the impact of forest management (by changing both the initial stand density and basal area thinning thresholds from current recommendations) on energy wood production (at energy wood thinning and final felling) and management-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy wood production in Finnish boreal conditions (62A degrees 39' N, 29A degrees 37' E). The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).

AB  - In Finland, over 220,000 ha of arable land has been afforested in recent decades. To meet the goals of forest management on afforested fields, information on the effects of former agricultural land use on soil fertility is needed. In this study, we examine the soil fertility of 12 former arable fields afforested either 10 or 60-70 years ago with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and adjacent sites that have been forested continuously. Volumetric soil samples were collected from the organic soil layer and from mineral soil to a depth of 40 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for pH, bulk density, organic matter content and amounts of nutrients (Kjeldahl N, extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and B). On afforested fields, amounts of nutrients in the mineral soil, especially in 10-year-old afforestations, were higher than on continuously forested sites. In the organic layer plus the 0-40 cm soil layer, the 10-year-old afforestations had 68% more N, 41% more P, 83% more K, 252% more Ca, 6% more Mg, 61% more Zn and 33% more B than the continuously forested sites at a comparable soil depth. In the 60-70-year-old afforestations, the differences were significant only for N, Ca and Zn (20% more N, 121% more Ca and 115% more Zn than on the continuously forested sites). The effects of agriculture on amounts of nutrients were most clearly detected in the former plough layer (0-20 cm) of the 10-year-old afforestations and in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the older afforestations. Amounts of nutrients in the organic layer of the afforested sites were lower, but their concentrations were higher than in the continuously forested sites. On the 10-year-old afforestations, the bulk density of the mineral soil tended to be lower and the organic matter content higher than on the continuously forested sites. On both young and old afforestations, soil pH was higher than on the continuously forest sites. According to these results, changes in soil properties caused by agriculture have increased the soil fertility and therefore probably also the site index. The results also suggest that changes in soil properties due to agricultural land use are quite long lasting.

AB  - 1. Species richness of plants generally decreases along elevational gradients or peaks at intermediate elevations. Land use including grazing by wild and domestic herbivores also affects plant communities and diversity, but how grazing affects plant diversity along elevational gradients is less clear.        2. Using a field experiment along an elevational gradient in Norway, we tested whether the impact of grazing on plant diversity interacts with elevation. Vascular plant communities were sampled following 10years of experimental sheep grazing (decreased/ceased, maintained and increased densities of 0, 25 and 80sheepkm(-2)) and compared with pre-experimental baseline data.        3. The impact of grazing on species richness (alpha diversity) was investigated at the species level, and temporal community variance was used to investigate community stability (temporal beta diversity). Spatial community variance (spatial beta diversity) at the enclosure level was used to test whether community homogenization differed between treatments.        4. Species richness and temporal stability varied between treatments and along the elevational gradient. Where grazing was ceased, species richness declined by up 3.7 species at low elevations and increased by up to 3.5 species at high elevations, whilst where grazing was maintained or increased, changes were less extreme along the elevational gradient.        5. Temporal stability of plant communities was highest at low elevations and lowest at high elevations where grazing was reduced. There were no clear differences in spatial homogenization between grazing treatments, although spatial species turnover increased in heathlands where grazing decreased.        6. Synthesis. This study shows that the effect of grazing on plant diversity varies with elevation, and grazing herbivores can thus directly affect elevational patterns of plant diversity. Grazing can buffer changes in plant communities and species richness, even in the face of other environmental drivers such as climatic warming.

AB  - Norwegian wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus are divided into 23 virtually isolated populations, primarily due to the abandonment of traditional migration and movement corridors caused by the development of infrastructures. By conducting a nation-wide, interdisciplinary pre-post study on a temporal scale spanning centuries, we modelled current reindeer movements with respect to archaeological findings to quantify long-term changes in area use related to anthropogenic disturbance. The location of 3,113 pitfall traps and hunting blinds, built 600-2000 years ago and used until 350-400 years ago, testified the location of traditional movement corridors. Current movement routes were delineated using Brownian Bridge Movement Models based on 147 reindeer GPS-monitored during 10 years. Using Path Analysis we quantified direct, indirect and total effects of different infrastructures within multiple scales (1, 5, and 10 km-radius buffers) on the current probability of use of ancient movement corridors. Tourist cabins and roads had the strongest long-term direct effects at most scales: 1 tourist cabin and 1 km road within a 1 km-radius buffer would lead, respectively, to complete area abandonment, and to a 46 % decrease in the probability of use. Power lines and private cabins had significant indirect effects on area use through their effect on roads, while hiking trails and, in particular, hydroelectric dams had highly variable effects, not significant at a nation-wide scale. Finally, we provide a flexible tool to estimate the potential long-term direct and cumulative effects of different types of infrastructures at the desired spatial scale to be used for the development of future sustainable land management plans.

AB  - Prior research has examined the relationship between physical landscapes and ecosystem services, but the distribution of ecosystem services by land tenure and protected areas is less developed. We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

AB  - 1. Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored.        2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way.        3. At the site where relative reindeer numbers and trampling intensity had increased the most, graminoid-dominated vegetation was now also found in the moderately grazed area. At the other site, the dominant vegetation types under all grazing intensities were the same as 14 years earlier.        4. We show that the heavily grazed, graminoid-dominated areas stored less C above-ground than the lightly grazed, shrub-dominated areas. Yet, the below-ground consequences of grazing-induced grassification varied between the sites: Grazing did not alter organic soil C stocks at the site where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs were abundant in the lightly grazed area, whereas heavy grazing increased organic soil C stocks at the site where the deciduous shrub Betula nana was dominant.        5. Our results indicate that, despite the negative impacts of grazers on above-ground C storage, their impact on below-ground C may even be positive. We suggest that the site-specific responses of organic soil C stocks to grazing could be explained by the differences in vegetation under light grazing. This would imply that the replacement of deciduous shrubs by graminoids, as a consequence of grazing could be beneficial for C sequestration in tundra soils.

AB  - Even-aged forests usually act as carbon sinks during most of their rotation. However, after clearcut they become sources of carbon for a period of several years. Applying uneven-aged forest management with selective cuttings will maintain tree cover and reduce the environmental impact on forest floor. The aim of this study was to compare the soil CO2 efflux between uneven-aged and even-aged Norway spruce stands with similar site properties, to investigate the effect of management practices on soil CO2 efflux and its possible correlation with soil environmental and chemical properties. We measured soil CO2 efflux in even- and uneven-aged Norway spruce stands (Picea abies [L.] Karst) in southern Finland during the summer of 2013 using closed chamber method on fixed measuring points. The study included two uneven-aged stands and two even-aged stands (a clearcut site and a mature even-aged stand). Soil moisture and soil temperature were measured at the same time as soil CO2 efflux. Soil cores were collected from the topsoil of each study plot to determine soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Mean soil CO2 efflux through the summer was highest in the clearcut plot (0.367 mg m(-2) s(-1)) followed by the uneven-aged stands (0.298 and 0.257 mg m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and the smallest fluxes were measured in the mature even-aged stand (0.224 mg m(-1)s(-1)). There was no statistically significant difference in soil CO2 efflux between the even-and uneven-aged stands of the same site fertility. Even- and uneven-aged stands did not differ significantly in soil moisture or soil temperature. Soil CO2 efflux increased steadily with soil temperature, whereas increasing soil moisture considerably increased soil CO2 efflux at lower moisture levels but only moderately at higher soil moisture levels. Soil carbon and nitrogen concentration did not differ between the study plots of the same fertility. Uneven-aged structure forestry did not prevent the increase in soil CO2 efflux after cuttings. However, the large variation in soil CO2 efflux rates within the uneven-aged stands suggests that the stand level CO2 efflux can be controlled with the intensity of the cutting.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry in northern Sweden, Norway, and Finland is an extensive agroforestry system, and the management of reindeer occurs alongside other land uses such as forestry, hunting, and tourism. The economic, social, and environmental impact of using GPS collars to track the reindeer was evaluated in the Sami village of Njaarke in boreal Sweden. A second objective was to evaluate how adapted forest management influenced reindeer husbandry. The results show that the use of GPS tracking enables the improved monitoring of the reindeer but the financial costs were greater than the financial benefits. The increased income did not cover the costs of depreciation and maintenance. Whilst the labour inputs associated with reindeer husbandry were high, 30-40% of the gross value added by village activities were related to hunting, tourism, and the renting of fishing rights. The use of adaptive forest management was assumed to increase the number of reindeer that could be reared through to slaughter and it was calculated to increase the gross value added by reindeer husbandry by more than 30%.

AB  - Coastal areas are especially important to human well-being with half the world's population living within 60 km of the sea and three-quarters of all large cities located in the coastal zone. Supporting and regulatory ecosystem services in coastal areas have received considerable research attention given human vulnerability to climate change, but cultural ecosystem services in the coastal zone are less understood. This study describes and analyzes the distribution of cultural ecosystem values found in coastal areas in multiple countries (n = 5) and compares the results with non-coastal areas. Mapped cultural ecosystem values were collected from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Malaysia and analyzed to identify the type and intensity of ecosystem values located in coastal areas. Mapped ecosystem values were significantly more abundant in all coastal zones, regardless of ecosystem value category, country, population, or dominant land use. Compared to cultural ecosystem values, biological and life-sustaining values were mapped less frequently in the coastal zone. Economic and social values were significantly associated with developed (built) coastal zones, while aesthetic and recreation values were more strongly associated with natural coastal zones. Coastal access, especially by road, influences the mix of perceived values from nature-based values to anthropocentric values. Coastal zones will continue to be the principle location for potential future land use conflict given their high social and cultural value relative to other ecological values. Understanding trade-offs in coastal zone planning and management requires a systematic inventory of the full range of ecosystem services, including cultural services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Management of boreal forests with clear-cutting has a marked effect on forest biodiversity. One directly and severely affected group of species is ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), because of their dependence on living host trees. Key questions in nature conservation and potentially for fungal ecosystem services are whether EMF communities as regenerated stands age will develop into a similar composition as in natural stands, and whether forest regeneration method matters. We addressed these questions by analyzing EMF communities in (1) 157-174 year-old natural and about 50-year-old Scots pine forest stands regenerated by (2) clear-cutting and planting, or (3) shelterwood regeneration with naturally established seedlings. We identified 98 EMF species hypotheses (SHs) using IonTorrent sequencing of soil cores from nine forest stands. We compared these results with a sporocarp survey and an RFLP-analysis of ectomycorrhizal roots performed 18 years earlier.        When testing individual SHs (in the sequencing data 2013) 13 of the 20 most frequent EMF SHs in natural forest stands were present in similar frequencies in 50-year-old managed stands whereas 7 SHs were observed at different frequencies. The overall EMF community composition differed between natural and 50-year-old managed stands both when assessing sporocarp data from 1995 to 1998 and sequencing data from 2013. One individually tested SH was found to differ between 50-year-old shelterwood and clear-cut stands and no difference in EMF overall community composition was found between the two regeneration methods. Species richness was similar in all stands. The RFLP-analysis largely identified the same common species as the current study.        Our result suggests that timber harvest has a minor effect on frequent EMF in a 30-50 year perspective. However, both the current study of soil mycelia and the sporocarp survey imply the overall composition of EMF communities to be affected. A contributing factor is the higher presence of Norway spruce in the natural stands. Moreover, the majority of species were not sufficiently frequent to be statistically tested. The importance of surviving mycelia, spore bank and new spore deposition is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of reindeer pasturing on high mountain ecosystems in northern Norway was investigated using a landscape-ecological analysis. The most visible impacts of overgrazing are On the vegetation. In addition, soils and humus have been changed due to morphodynamic processes induced to a large extent by reindeer pasturing. Degradation of the high mountain landscapes within the last 30 years is described on 3 spatial levels: large-scale effects at specific localities, linear effects along reindeer fences, and small-scale effects on the altitudinal zonation of entire mountain systems. The structure of the ecosystem ha changed completely due to reindeer pasturing, which has resulted in landscape degradation under great pasturing pressure. The processes that influence the ecosystem as a function of different pasture intensities are described and show a complex correlation and interaction between the ecofactors. These include destruction of vegetation cover, reduction of roof density, erosion of humus and mineral soil horizons, reduction of soil moisture and soil stability, and changes in plant species composition. On the whole, degradation leads to a depression of the altitudinal belts, indicated by the new organization of the ecosystems. It can be concluded that reindeer herding at current levels is a destructive form of land use in the northern Norwegian high mountains and hence is not sustainable. The author believes that destruction of the natural environment could be reversed, although this is not to be expected.

AB  - The arctic forest-tundra ecotone (FTE) represents a major transition zone between contrasting ecosystems, which can be strongly affected by climatic and biotic factors. Expected northward expansion and encroachment on arctic tundra in response to climate warming may be counteracted by natural and anthropogenic processes such as defoliating insect outbreaks and grazing/browsing regimes. Such natural and anthropogenic changes in land cover can substantially affect FTE dynamics, alter ground albedo (index of the amount of solar energy reflected back into the atmosphere) and provide important feedbacks into the climate system. We took advantage of a naturally occurring contrast between reindeer grazing regimes in a border region between northern Finland and Norway which was recently defoliated by an outbreak of the geometrid moth. We examined ecosystem-wide contrasts between potentially year-round (but mainly summer) grazed (YRG) regions in Finland and mainly winter grazed (WG) regions in Norway. We also used a remotely sensed vegetation index and albedo to quantify effects on local energy balance and potential climate feedbacks. Although differences in soil characteristics and ground vegetation cover were small, we found dramatic differences in the tree layer component of the ecosystem. Regeneration of mountain birch stands appears to have been severely hampered in the YRG regime, by limiting regeneration from basal shoots and reestablishment of individual trees from saplings. This has led to a more open forest structure and a significant 5% increase in spring albedo in the summer grazed compared to the winter grazed regions. This supports recent suggestions that ecosystem processes in the Arctic can significantly influence the climate system, and that such processes must be taken into account when developing climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies.

AB  - We studied reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) distribution in relation to possible travel barriers (roads and power lines) in south-central Norway, 1997-2000, using lichen biomass as an indicator of reindeer use. We recorded lichen cover on both sides of potential barriers within comparable habitat in 42 sites for 3 different reindeer herds. We used cover-biomass regressions to assess the relationship between lichen cover and biomass. In 2 of the regions, lichen biomass was 5.3 times and 2.8 times higher in areas isolated by 2 parallel power lines and an adjacent winter-closed road compared to biomass on the other side of the potential barrier. In a third region, lichen biomass did not vary significantly between areas on either side of a single "inter-closed road. Lichen biomass data suggested that wild reindeer used both sides of a closed road in winter, whereas 2 parallel power lines and a winter-closed road in combination reduced reindeer migration and resulted in very different grazing pressures on either side of the power lines, even 30 years after the power lines were constructed. Construction of power lines, and particularly parallel power lines, should thus be avoided in wild reindeer habitat. Fragmentation of wild reindeer ranges in Norway results in a substantial reduction in available ranges and traditional migration routes between important seasonal ranges, with a likely overall reduction in carrying capacity.

AB  - The tree species used in production forests can have direct implications for the understory vegetation, due to species-specific differences in the environmental conditions provided, and silviculture applied. In southern Sweden, there is an ongoing shift from even-aged managed stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) to even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies). Here we evaluate the potential ecological consequences of these conversions by surveying the understory vascular plants, stand structural characteristics, and associated understory light levels in three age categories of Scots pine and Norway spruce stands. We quantify the extent of difference in light transmittance between the two stand types, and find large differences in understory abundance, especially among the dwarf shrubs species. Whereas bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) generally dominated Scots pine stand understory, the understory of Norway spruce stands was comparably sparse. Differences in vascular plant community composition indicate associated differences between the two stand types in the conditions prior to stand establishment, and subsequent understory development. In Scots pine stands the high abundance of dwarf shrubs may be outcompeting other species of vascular plants, causing a decline in species richness. In Norway spruce stands, species richness and abundance was instead apparently inhibited by limited light transmittance. In these stands generalist ruderal species and remnants from previous land use constituted a considerable part of plant species composition. Our findings suggest that the regional replacement of Scots pine with Norway spruce will lead to a noticeable loss of understory diversity, for which the decline in Vaccinium species will be the most prominent. We discuss the associated implications of our results for forest ecosystem services, and how shortened rotation lengths in Norway spruce stands would compound these impacts.

AB  - Understanding how drivers of change affect ecosystem services (ES) is of great importance. Indicators of ES can be developed based on biophysical measures and be used to investigate the service flow from ecosystems to socio-ecological systems. However, the ES concept is multivariate and the use of normalized composite indicators reduces complexity and facilitates communication between science and policy. The aim of this study is to analyze how land use change affects ES and species richness and how the effects are modified by environmental factors by using composite indicators based on biophysical indicators. Using multivariate and regression analyses, we analyze the effect of grazing management abandonment in semi-natural grasslands in Norway on six ES: nutrient cycling, pollination, forage quality, aesthetics and global and regional climate regulation in addition to species richness along soil and climate gradients. Nutrient cycling, forage quality, regional climate regulation, aesthetics and species richness are larger in managed compared to abandoned grasslands. There are trade-offs among ES as different management strategies provide various ES and these trade-offs vary along environmental gradients. Management policies that aim to conserve ES need to have conservation goals that are context dependent, should recognize ES trade-offs and be adapted to local conditions.

AB  - Mesocarnivores increase in number and geographic range in human-disturbed ecosystems with cascading negative impact on biodiversity. To mitigate such impacts, it is essential to identify the proximate causes of such mesocarnivore releases. Here, we assess to what extent increased partial migration in semi-domesticated tundra reindeer induce a response in boreal and arctic mesocarnivores. We used a large-scale and multiyear quasi-experimental study design with camera traps deployed on coastal tundra peninsulas in northern Norway to estimate area occupancy of the whole carnivore community. These peninsulas represent summer pastures for separate semi-domestic reindeer herds that, owing to different degrees of partial migration, now display spatially and temporally variable densities of year-round resident reindeer. We estimated resident reindeer density by means of aerial surveys. Area occupancy of all the recorded carnivore species increased strongly when resident reindeer densities exceeded 15deerkm(-2). Most of the increasing carnivore species were typical boreal forest species, implying range expansions into tundra when provided with stable food resources (prey and carrion) in terms of resident reindeer.Synthesis and applications. We found that boreal mesocarnivores, known to negatively impact the productivity of reindeer and arctic wildlife of conservation concern, steeply increased in tundra areas with many year-round resident reindeer due to increased partial migration. To avoid such negative impacts, actions should be taken to minimize residency in tundra reindeer.

AB  - Southern Norway holds the last remaining population of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Roads, railroads, and power lines have fragmented the original population into 26 separate herds. The reindeer populations are regulated directly according to availability of winter forage. These winter ranges, generally at lower elevations, are however, often subjected to development. Effects of infrastructure and associated human activity on the distribution of wild reindeer during winter were investigated in the Nordfjella mountain region of western Norway. Systematic aerial surveys of the distribution of ca. 2500 reindeer were conducted during late winter 1986-1998. Areas within 2.5 km from power lines were used less than available in 6 of the 8 sampling years, and areas beyond this zone more than expected. Density of reindeer was 79% lower within 2.5 km from power lines compared with background areas, and increased with increasing distance from infrastructure for comparable habitat. Available forage in terms of lichen cover declined 15-30-fold with distance, and was lowest in the undisturbed areas with the highest density of grazing animals. Areas within 5 kni from resorts or from roads and power lines in combination were avoided in all years. Continued construction of roads, power lines and cabin resorts endanger these available winter ranges, and hence the long term survival of the population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - During the last 25 yr, Sami reindeer husbandry in parts of Finnmarksvidda in the Norwegian Arctic has been in a critical state because of overexploitation of lichen-dominated tundra, which serves as winter forage. To better understand the ecosystem's capabilities for recovery we investigated vegetation cover changes over a 7-yr period, starting in 1998, at 52 sites dispersed over a large area at Finnmarksvidda. Two types of plots were established: one fenced from reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period. Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083 +/- 0.011 per year in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time, fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition, lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz, shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were repairable. The vegetation transitions which have taken place in the study area are considered to be reversible with fewer persistent effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB  - One of the largest threats to biodiversity is land use change and habitat loss. Hollow oaks (Quercus spp. L.) are well-defined patches that are hotspots for biodiversity and red-listed species, but they are often rare and fragmented in the landscape. We investigated the effect of patch size, habitat quality, and isolation on functional groups and red-listed saproxylic beetles in hollow oaks (n = 40) in Norway. The groups were defined by host tree association, trophic grouping, and red-listed status. Habitat quality, represented by tree form was most important in explaining species richness for most groups. Patch size, represented by circumference and amount of dead branches, was most important in explaining abundance. Isolation, that is single oaks compared with oaks in groups, had a negative effect on the abundance of beetles feeding both on wood and fungi (xylomycethopagous), as well as on species associated with broadleaved trees (oak semi-specialists), but did not affect species richness. This indicates that at this scale and in this landscape, isolated oaks are as species rich and valuable for conservation as other oaks, although some functional groups may be more vulnerable to isolation than others. The red-listed species only responded to patch size, indicating that oaks with large circumference and many dead branches are especially important for red-listed species and for conservation.

AB  - There is consensus that land-use change is a main driver behind the recent declines of many pollinator populations in Europe. However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

AB  - Declining populations of wild pollinators have increased the interest in the management of human-modified landscapes for pollinator conservation. Modified landscape features, such as power-line clearings, may provide valuable habitats with increased floral resources for insect pollinators and solitary bees in particular. However, whether the effects of costly habitat interventions on bee communities in power-line clearings are sustained over time, is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment in 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was; 1) cut and left to decay, 2) cut and removed, or 3) uncut. We assessed the temporal effects of habitat interventions and environmental factors on species richness, abundance, functional groups of nesting preference, body size, tongue-length, and species composition. Species richness and abundance of solitary bees increased substantially with time in both the cleared treatments. But compared to leaving the woody debris to decay, woody debris removal more than doubled estimated bee richness and abundance in areas with a higher forb richness and increased the trait variation in areas with high functional trait variation of forbs, dead wood, and available source habitats. The positive effect of woody debris removal on the species and functional trait diversity of bees was sustained during three years post-treatment, but the effect was dependent on abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Over time the sites increasingly attracted bees from the regional species pool, showing how power-lines may benefit bee populations at a regional scale, through maintenance of temporary refugia in a forested landscape. The current routine practice (cut and left to decay) improves habitat quality for many bee species through alterations to early succession. However, our results indicate that the more costly woody debris removal is a more effective conservation measure for solitary bee communities over time and is to be recommended when funds are available. Removing the woody debris after routine maintenance clearing at specific sites may further enhance the diversity and persistence of bee populations over time, contributing to more diverse and stable bee communities.

AB  - Due to pressure to raise forest productivity in Sweden, there are proposals to apply more intensive forestry methods, but they could have potentially large effects on biodiversity. Here we report a compilation and evaluation of the extent and significance of such effects. We evaluated potential effects on biodiversity by introducing intensively fertilized Norway spruce plantations as a management option in Swedish forests with low conservation values on insects, vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes, and red-listed species. Due to a lack of specific studies addressing this question, we based the evaluation on a combination of available and appropriate empiric and anecdotic knowledge; literature data, and expert judgments largely available in species data bases. Our evaluations suggest that such forests will only harbor species that are common and widespread in conventionally managed stands and that species of conservation interest will be lacking, due to the low heterogeneity and light intensity of even-aged monocultures with dense canopies, short rotation times and low availability of coarse woody debris. Effects at the landscape scale are more difficult to evaluate, but will be dependent on the area utilized and the conservation value of sites used. We conclude that negative effects on biodiversity can be reduced if: (1) only land with the lowest conservational value is utilized; (2) plantations are spatially arranged to minimize fragmentation of the landscape; (3) the quality and quantity of key structural elements (e.g., coarse woody debris, old living trees and snags) are maintained at the landscape level; and (4) management intensity is relaxed on other land. For effective implementation of these measures, legislative frameworks and policy instruments need to be adjusted and new models for planning and monitoring need to be developed.

AB  - It is important that measures to maintain biodiversity are taken in a way that is cost-effective for the landowner. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures that aim at increasing the substrate availability for red-listed (species that are threatened, near threatened or where species probably are threatened but data is deficient) saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) organisms. We modelled stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three regions of Sweden by using computer simulations and a database with substrate requirements of saproxylic beetles and cryptogams on the Swedish Red-List. Conclusions concerning cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures depend on the extinction thresholds of the species they are intended to conserve; measures that generate only small amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD) may provide too little substrate to be useful for species with high extinction thresholds. In northern Sweden, forestland is relatively inexpensive, so a cost-effective strategy to increase the amount of spruce CWD was to set aside more forests as reserves. In central and southern Sweden, more emphasis should instead be given to increasing the amount of CWD in the managed forest. The regulations by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) could be made more cost-effective by prescribing creation of more high stumps and retention of larger amounts of naturally dying trees. Large-sized CWD, CWD from slow-growing trees, and CWD in late decay stages are substrate types that were particularly rare in managed forest in relation to unmanaged forests. Manual soil scarification and retention of living trees are measures that can increase the proportion of these underrepresented CWD types. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we investigated hollow oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petrea) situated in open landscapes and in forests in Norway in northern Europe, and compared their importance for rare and threatened beetles (Coleoptera). Old, hollow oak trees, both in parks and in forests, were extremely rich in red-listed beetles, and hosted a high proportion of threatened species. The proportion of oak associated species and the mean number of red-listed beetle species per tree was similar in the two site types, but rarefaction showed that for a certain number of individuals, oaks in forests had more threatened and near-threatened species than oaks in parks. The species composition also differed between site types: Park oaks had a higher proportion of species associated with hollows and animal nests, whereas in forests, there was a higher proportion of species depending on dead oak wood in general. Four factors were significant in explaining the richness of red-listed beetles in our study: Tree circumference, cavity decay stage, proportion of oak in the surroundings, and coarse woody debris (CWD) in the surroundings. Forest oaks were smaller, but they still trapped a species richness comparable to that of the larger park oaks-probably a result of high amounts of CWD in the surroundings. We show that oaks in open landscapes and oaks in forest have only partly overlapping beetle assemblages and, thus, cannot be substituted in conservation. Planning for conservation of red-listed beetles associated with this key habitat demands a large scale perspective, both in space and time, as the surroundings have important effects on associated threatened and near threatened species.

AB  - The availability of habitat for wood-dependent species has been greatly reduced in Fennoscandian boreal forests and hence the setting aside of forest land for conservation purposes is a common strategy. Here, we explore the biodiversity quality and conservation relevance of three categories of set-asides dominated by Norway spruce (nature reserves, woodland key habitats and retention patches, i.e. groups of living trees left on clear-cut areas) and a non set-aside forest category (old managed spruce forests) in a boreal forest region in central Sweden. The comparisons are based on surveys of (1) dead wood volumes, (2) diversity of dead wood types in terms of tree species, decomposition stage, diameter and presence of bark and (3) occurrence of saproxylic (i.e. wood dependent) beetles in Norway spruce, Picea abies. For saproxylic beetles, species richness, species composition and occurrence of red-listed species were compared. In total 180 dead wood types and 129 beetle species were found, 12 of which were red-listed. We found no significant difference between the forest categories in terms of total dead wood volume. However, the rarefied number of dead wood types was significantly greater in reserves and key habitats compared to retention patches. Woodland key habitats had significantly more beetle species than retention patches and old managed forests, as well as significantly more red-listed species than the retention patches. The species composition of retention patches, differed significantly from that of old managed forests and reserves, probably due to higher degrees of sun-exposure. We conclude that the conservation strategies explored in this study, provide valuable habitats and contribute differently to the preservation of old forests and saproxylic beetles. We would add that inventories, to identify conservation values, should be carried out prior to harvest of old stands and that measures should be taken accordingly to set-aside the parts of forest stands with the highest biodiversity values.

AB  - Management of ancient trees constitutes a major dilemma in the conservation of associated biodiversity. While traditional methods are often advocated, such practices may incur considerable costs and their effects have rarely been scientifically evaluated. We compared the communities of lichenized fungi, non-lichenized fungi, and bryophytes among equal number of coarse previously pollarded and unmanaged trees (n = 340). On 400 Ulmus glabra and 280 Fraxinus excelsior trees at 62 sites in Norway, we found 209 lichenized fungi, 128 non-lichenized fungi, and 115 bryophytes. Pollarded trees were richer in microhabitats than unmanaged trees and had significantly higher richness of bryophytes (ash) and non-lichenized fungi (ash and elm), the latter increasing with the availability of dead wood, cavities and coarse bark structure in pollarded trees. Further, the average total number of red-listed species, and red-listed lichenized fungi separately, were significantly higher on pollarded versus unmanaged trees, with diversity related to trunk circumference, depth of bark fissures and number of cavities. Our results underline the importance of microhabitats associated with old trees, but we cannot establish with certainty the importance of pollarding per se. Since we did not find any negative effect of canopy cover for community diversity, we assume that old trees with rich epiphytic communities can develop without management intervention. The high share (37 out of 49) of red-listed species occurring on unmanaged trees, and the fact that 11 red-listed species were found exclusively on unmanaged trees, may further indicate that unmanaged trees can with time replace the ancient pollarded trees as habitats for rich cryptogamic communities.

AB  - Herbivores are often drivers of ecosystem states and dynamics and in many situations are managed either as livestock or through controlled or exploitative hunting of wild populations. Changes in herbivore density can affect the composition of plant communities. Management of herbivore densities could therefore be regulated to benefit plant species of conservation concern. In this study we use a unique spatial dataset of large herbivores in Norway to test whether herbivore density affects the distribution of rare red-listed plant species in tundra ecosystems, and to identify regions where herbivore density is the most important factor in determining the habitat suitability for the plant species. For all selected species a climatic variable was the most important determinant of the distribution, but herbivore density was an important determinant of some species notably Primula scandinavica. Herbivore density was the most important factor determining habitat suitability for this species in 13% of mainland Norway. Regions of Norway where the management of herbivore densities is most strongly linked to the habitat suitability of red-listed plant species are mapped. However, there was very low concordance in the localities of these areas; at any individual locality, habitat suitability was limited by herbivore density for only a small subset of the species. This suggests that management of herbivores for the benefit of rare plant species needs to be tailored for individual locations or species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emulation of natural disturbances in harvesting has become a widely accepted approach to reach ecologically sustainable forest management. The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of polypore fungi (species richness and composition) on four different cutting methods (selection, gap, patch, and clear-cutting) plus uncut controls, and the creation of high stumps and cut logs in combination with harvesting. Polypores were inventoried one year before, and two and seven years after cutting. A total of 71 polypore species were found, but no red-listed species were recorded seven years after cutting. Irrespective of the treatment, the variation in polypore richness was best explained by the number of deadwood objects in the stands. Species richness per deadwood object was the highest on natural logs. Species richness per volume of spruce deadwood was the highest on small-diameter deadwood and stumps, intermediate on natural logs and lower on cut logs and high stumps. These results indicate that cut logs created in harvesting cannot compensate the loss of deadwood in cutting and energy wood harvesting. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in rapidly creating habitats for red-listed polypores in commercially managed forests.

AB  - We surveyed the quantity and quality of dead Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees and wood-inhabiting cryptogams in a managed boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. Size and decay of dead trees was related to substrate utilization by wood-inhabiting species. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was surveyed along 34 strip transects. CWD and wood-inhabiting cryptogams were surveyed in eight circular plots at each site. A total of 6195 spruce CWD units occurred along strip transects and 809 spruce CWD units in circular plots. On average 2.2 m(3)/ha spruce CWD was found on the plots. The majority (63%) of the transect CWD units were <10 cm diameter and in early to intermediate decay stages. Sixty-eight wood-specific species of fungi, lichens, mosses, and hepatics occurred on the plots. Of these, 13 occurred on greater than or equal to 5% of the 809 CWD units surveyed for wood-inhabiting species. Eight species occur on the Swedish red lists, indicating that such species are indeed uncommon in managed forests. Red-listed species showed strong preferences for large diameter CWD and CWD in late decay stages, i.e., substrates that are poorly represented in managed forests. Frequently occurring species, however showed utilization patterns that correspond with the distribution of the substrate types.

AB  - Understanding what determines wildlife species richness and community composition in urban green spaces is important for wildlife management and urban planning. Numerous studies have assessed the relationships between attributes of urban green spaces (size, vegetation, isolation, urbanization) and bird species richness, but little is known about how these factors influence community composition. I censused breeding land birds in 93 urban green spaces in Oslo, Norway, and species were grouped according to ecology (habitat preference, nest site, migration, diet, and red-list status). I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city.

AB  - Decline in the amount of coarse woody debris is a major factor resulting in habitat deterioration for saproxylic organisms in forests. This study assessed the effects of forest restoration (increasing the amount of decaying wood) on dead wood and wood-decaying fungi. The data were collected from Norway spruce and Scots pine dominated forest stands in Finland that had been used for timber production until they were set aside as reserves. Dead trees and polypore fungi were inventoried five years after restoration and compared with control forests. Altogether, 50 polypore species were found from the study area. Restoration clearly increased the amount of dead wood (11.5 vs. 1.1 m(3)/site) as well as the average number of common polypores (6.6 vs. 2.9 species/site) but no threatened species were found. Variation in the dead wood types (decay stages) was low in the restored sites which probably hinders the occurrence of rare species. Thus, our results suggest that restoring dead wood does not immediately benefit the populations of red-listed and rare polypores, although restoration clearly alters the fungal assemblages. A longer time span is needed until the restored substrates become suitable for most red-listed species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates how the placement and the different possible outcomes of a spruce retention tree affected species richness and assemblages of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles. In a field experiment in the boreal zone of central Norway, high stumps were created and compared with residual wood pieces (i.e. top boles with branches), in clear-cuts versus in forest edges. Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge. To cater for the variety of habitat preferences among forest beetles in managed forest, managers should leave both standing spruce trees (many of which will end up as windthrown, downed holes) and some high stumps (to secure some upright dead wood), in both exposed clear-cut and semi-shaded forest edge.

AB  - In production forests, a common silvicultural objective is enhancing tree growth rates. The growth rate influences both mechanical and biochemical properties of wood, which may have an impact on dead wood inhabiting (i.e. saproxylic) species. In this study, we tested for the first time whether tree growth rates affect dead-wood associated assemblages in general and the occurrence of red-listed species in particular. We sampled saproxylic beetles (eclector traps) and fungi (DNA metabarcoding of wood samples) in dead trunks of Norway spruce (Picea abies), which had different growth rates within the same hemiboreal forests in Sweden. A high proportion of fungi showed a positive association to increasing tree growth. This resulted in higher fungal richness in fast-grown trees both at the trunk scale and across multiple studied trunks. Such patterns were not observed for saproxylic beetles. However, a set of species (both beetles and fungi) preferred slow-grown wood. Moreover, the total number of red-listed species was highest in slow-grown trunks. We conclude that dead wood from slow-grown trees hosts relatively fewer saproxylic species, but a part of these may be vulnerable to production forestry. It implies that slow-grown trees should be a target in nature conservation. However, where slow-grown trees are absent, for instance in forests managed for a high biomass production, increasing the volumes of dead wood from fast-grown trees may support many species.

AB  - In an effort to understand processes accompanying aging of forest stands and to support management of commercial forests, population characteristics of epigeic arthropod assemblages (spiders, ground beetles, centipedes, millipedes and woodlice - suborder Oniscidea) were studied in spruce monoculture stands and compared with local environmental factors (litter, coarse and fine woody debris, canopy closure, and moss, herb and shrub cover). Arthropod sampling was conducted in 15 differently aged stands using pitfall traps, with environmental variables monitored concurrently. A total of 66 spider, 29 ground beetle, 12 centipede, 8 millipede and 3 woodlice species were determined. In general, litter depth, herb cover, canopy closure and the amount of coarse woody debris had the greatest influence on assemblage composition in all groups. Spider community composition, being more stenotopic than other arthropod groups, was affected by the highest number of factors. A closer association with site conditions in spiders and ground beetles was manifested by a marked differentiation in the occurrence of forest and open-habitat species in the youngest (open) and oldest (closed) stands, though neither the total species number nor abundance differed significantly throughout stand development. Contrary to arthropod assemblages, significant relationships between ecological groups and environmental variables were identified only in several cases. Centipede diversity (as defined by biodiversity indices) was significantly higher in 30-35-year-old stands. Appropriate intervention in homogenous spruce stands may help increase habitat availability for most epigeic arthropods, thus enhancing, or at least maintaining, biodiversity within such habitats.

AB  - Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) has been recognized for the production of multiple ecosystem services, and is seen as an alternative to clear-cut forestry (CF). Despite the increasing interest, it is still not well described how CCF would affect the carbon balance and the resulting climate benefit from the forest in relation to CF. This study compares carbon balances of CF and CCF, applied as two alternative land-use strategies for a heterogeneous Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand. We use a set of models to analyze the long-term effects of different forest management and wood use strategies in Sweden on carbon dioxide emissions and carbon stock changes. The results show that biomass growth and yield is more important than the choice of silvicultural system per se. When comparing CF and CCF assuming similar growth, extraction and product use, only minor differences in long-term climate benefit were found between the two principally different silvicultural systems.

AB  - Swedish forest and environmental policies imply that forests should be managed so that all naturally occurring species are maintained in viable populations. This requires maintenance of functional networks of representative natural forest and cultural woodland habitats. We first review the policy implementation process regarding protected areas in Sweden 1991-2010, how ecological knowledge was used to formulate interim short-term and strategic long-term biodiversity conservation goals, and the development of a hierarchical spatial planning approach. Second, we present data about the amount of formally protected and voluntarily set aside forest stands, and evaluate how much remains in terms of additional forest protection, conservation management and habitat restoration to achieve forest and environmental policy objectives in the long-term. Third, a case study in central Sweden was made to estimate the functionality of old Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous forest habitats, as well as cultural woodland, in different forest regions. Finally, we assess operational biodiversity conservation planning processes. We conclude that Swedish policy pronouncements capture the contemporary knowledge about biodiversity and conservation planning well. However, the existing area of protected and set-aside forests is presently too small and with too poor connectivity. To bridge this gap, spatial planning, management and restoration of habitat, as well as collaboration among forest and conservation planners need to be improved.

AB  - Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry.

AB  - This study investigated the forest history, structural characteristics, the presence of fungal species suggested to indicate ecological continuity in old-growth forest, and the species composition of saproxylic beetles in 30 old forest "woodland key habitats" (WKHs). and compared them with production forest in the same age-class in south-eastern Norway. No statistically significant differences in forest characteristics, community of saproxylic beetles or number of red-listed beetles were found between the WKHs and the production forest, probably owing to a combination of profound long-term logging and a lack of will to delineate sufficiently large WKHs in the one area with significantly less forestry impact. The study indicates the advantage of including forest history information in WKH selection where such data exist, and the importance of restoring habitats in heavily exploited forest landscapes.

AB  - Forest restoration measures, such as dead wood retention and creation at the time of final felling, increase the amount of dead trees and should benefit a large proportion of species dependent on sun-exposed dead wood. In this study, the value of retained dead wood and high-cut stumps was evaluated in terms of how much they contribute to the population of the red-listed beetle Peltis grossa in a forest landscape. The evaluation was based on a population estimate before and after restoration started in the study landscape. The restoration started in 1994 with 425 high-cut stumps of Norway spruce on six experimental clear-cuts and continued 4 years later with high-cutting and retention of dead trees becoming a standard measure in the 10 000-ha forest landscape. Ten years after high-cutting, adults of P. grossa started to emerge from the stumps on the experimental clear-cuts and the number of emergence holes was counted each year during the following eight years (2003-2010). During this period, the average yearly recruitment of P. grossa from these stumps were c. 300 individuals, adding up to a total of c. 2250 emergence holes. In 2005, all clear-cuts made during 1990-2000 and random samples of young and old forest stands were inventoried in transects across the landscape. In total, 1219 emergence holes were found in 2005; all of them on the clear-cuts and none in the forest stands. Our study is the first to show that habitat restoration can increase population growth of a threatened saproxylic species on a landscape scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Isolation of habitats in space and time affects species globally and in a multitude of ecosystems. It is however often difficult to assess the level of isolation from the point of view of the focal species. Indicator species are often used to assess 'conservation value' of habitats. One such approach involves the use of wood-decaying fungal species as indicators of near-natural forests, continuity in old-forest characteristics over time, and/or presence of red-listed species, but not of spatial connectivity. The indicator species were commonly assigned based on expert opinions, but few scientific evaluations have been performed of what these species actually indicate. Building on previous classifications of wood-decaying fungal indicator species on Norway spruce, we hypothesized that indicator species would differ from non-indicator species in how they respond to local temporal connectivity (forest age, the intensity of historical selective logging and the presence of well-decomposed large logs), and to local and landscape-scale spatial connectivity (local forest area, local amount of deadwood and the connectivity to old forest in the surrounding landscape). Based on fungal occurrence data from a fixed number of spruce logs at 28 sites distributed across the Scandinavian Peninsula, we explored the spatiotemporal scales at which the local communities were affected by connectivity. Indicator species showed the strongest response to connectivity of old forest (>= 80 years) within 100 km, while non-indicator species depended on connectivity of younger forest (>= 40 years) at a smaller spatial scale (>= 25 km). Indicator species increased and non-indicator species decreased in total abundance with the increasing age of the local forest stand. Landscape-scale old-forest connectivity was beneficial for indicator species in all sites except those with relatively low amount of deadwood, while non-indicator species showed the opposite pattern. We identify a threshold of around 29 m(3) ha(-1) in the amount of spruce logs where indicator species become abundant enough to influence non-indicator species through competitive interactions. There was a pronounced uniformity within each species group in the connectivity responses. We conclude that the studied indicator species indicate high forest age, high amount of resources and, given that the resources are plentiful, also high old-forest connectivity, but they do not indicate a long history without any logging operations or local deadwood continuity. The studied non-indicator species did not indicate any of the studied spatiotemporal connectivity variables. Indicator species are usually red-listed and may continue to decline in the future without habitat restoration efforts.

AB  - Forests used for timber production provide essential ecosystem services to society, as well as potential breeding habitat for bird communities. In southern Sweden, 90% of productive forest land is used for timber production and stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) constitute approximately 40% of the forested area. Due to their homogeneous structure, these spruce production forests are often regarded as depauperate. Despite this perception, knowledge about the biodiversity found in these stands is scarce. Here we synthesize the results of four separate bird surveys conducted within 35 spruce production stands of southern Sweden. The results are compared to recent population trends within the general study area. In total 49 bird species were recorded, with a strong difference in species composition between newly planted clear-cuts (forest age <15 years) and forests older than 15 years. The majority of species encountered in the older forest category were common forest birds, with a single red-listed species among the regularly occurring species. In contrast, three red-listed "farmland species" were frequently encountered in the newly planted forests, revealing the capacity of those birds preferring open and recently disturbed habitats to utilize clear-cuts. A higher diversity of tree sizes and the inclusion of even relatively small proportions (<15%) of broadleaved tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness. Several species encountered in spruce production forests are declining in numbers, but it is not clear whether these stands are acting as source or sink environments for their populations. However, our results indicate that relatively small adjustments to spruce forest management should improve the quality of this widespread habitat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decaying wood plays an important role in forest biodiversity, nutrient cycling and carbon balance. Community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi changes with mass loss of wood, but the relationship between substrate quality and decomposers is poorly understood. This limits the extent to which these ecosystem services can be effectively managed. We studied the fungal community and physico-chemical quality (stage of decay, dimensions, density, moisture, C similar to:similar to N ratio, lignin and water or ethanol extractives) of 543 Norway spruce logs in five unmanaged boreal forest sites of southern Finland. Fungi were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of DNA extracted directly from wood samples. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were also recorded. Results showed a fungal community succession with decreasing wood density and C similar to:similar to N ratio, and increasing moisture and lignin content. Fungal diversity peaked in the most decayed substrates. Ascomycetes typically colonized recently fallen wood. Brown-rot fungi preferred the intermediate decay stages. White-rot fungi represented approximately one-fifth of sequenced species in all decay phases excluding the final phase, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi became dominant. Lignin content of logs with white-rot fungi was low, and ECM fungi were associated with substrates containing abundant nitrogen. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were observed for only a small number of species detected with molecular techniques.

AB  - This paper reports on the performance of the red-listed Primula scandinavica, endemic to Scandinavia. The study took place in Jotunheimen, Norway. We evaluated occurrence, density and sexual reproduction variables (number of fertile individuals and number of seed capsules). Habitats were registered as land-cover categories (historical and current; broad habitat types) and habitat patch classes (semi-natural and natural; fine-grained habitat types). Spatial overlay analyses and maximum likelihood tests of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to assess the habitat quality of the land-cover categories and the habitat patch classes. In most (96%) of the observed occurrences the species was located at a site that had open vegetation 40 years ago but is now becoming forested or covered by shrubs. The highest densities of P. scandinavica were found in "heathland" and "grassland in transition into woodland", while the potential for sexual reproduction was highest in "grassland" and lowest in "grassland in transition into woodland". The results indicate that many of the populations in the study area are remnants and that the habitats of highest quality are semi-natural habitat patches. The changed land use practices in mountain areas have resulted and will result in fewer and smaller populations. However, as also climatic conditions will change it is not straightforward to predict the future performance of P. scandinavica.

AB  - In this study of bryophyte diversity in 110 patches of spruce forests of bilberry, small fern, low herb, tall fern and tall herb type in Sor-Trondelag, central Norway, each patch (from 0.24 to 9.33 ha) was classified as one main vegetation type and one successional stage or cutting class. The bryophytes in each patch were censused in randomly established squares of 10 x 10 m, supplemented by complete sampling in the rest of the patch. A number of environmental variables was sampled, and the data sets treated with DCA and CCA. Altogether 210 bryophytes (71 liverworts and 139 mosses) were found in the squares, and 285 (96 liverworts and 189 mosses) in the forest patches. The average number of liverworts, mosses and bryophytes in forest patches increased gradually from the dry and poor to the moist and rich forest types.

AB  - A main objective of game management on public lands in Norway is to ensure that harvest levels are sustainable while securing hunting access to the public. The willow ptarmigan is a popular but red-listed small game species, and it is challenging for managers to optimize harvest levels based on uncertain population estimates and limited knowledge of the factors influencing hunting impact. We studied how willow ptarmigan hunting effort, catch per unit effort, and harvest rates were influenced by ptarmigan density, topography, vegetation, and infrastructure. Data were collected during 2013-2016 from 162 hunting blocks covering 26,828km(2) state-owned land in the counties Nordland and Troms, northern Norway. Hunting effort averaged 1.27days/km(2) (SD=2.08), and it was the highest in areas close to roads and cabins. We found an opposite effect on the catch per unit effort (CPUE, mean=0.77 ptarmigan/day, SD=0.48), which was lower close to roads. There was a marked positive effect of density on CPUE, whereas terrain steepness (slope) had a negative effect. On average, harvest removed <10% of the autumn population in the hunting areas during the study period. This indicates a relatively low and partially compensatory hunting mortality in most years and areas. Although this study shows a low harvest rate, we recommend managers to survey ptarmigan populations, hunting effort, and harvest, especially in easily accessible areas close to infrastructure and in periods of low population density.

AB  - The increasing demand for biofuels from logging residues require serious attention on the importance of dead wood substrates on clear-cuts for the many forestry-intolerant saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) species. In particular, the emerging harvest of low stumps motivates further study of these substrates. On ten clear-cuts we compared the species richness, abundance and species composition of saproxylic beetles hatching from four to nine year old low stumps, high stumps and logs of Norway spruce. By using emergence traps we collected a total of 2,670 saproxylic beetles among 195 species during the summers of 2006, 2007 and 2009. We found that the species assemblages differed significantly between high stumps and logs all three years. The species assemblages of low stumps, on the other hand, were intermediate to those found in logs and high stumps. There were also significant difference in species richness between the three examined years, and we found significant effect of substrate type on richness of predators and fungivores. As shown in previous studies of low stumps on clear-cuts they can sustain large numbers of different saproxylic beetles, including red-listed species. Our study does, in addition to this fact, highlight a possible problem in creating just one type of substrate as a tool for conservation in forestry. Species assemblages in high stumps did not differ significantly from those found in low stumps. Instead logs, which constitute a scarcer substrate type on clear-cuts, provided habitat for a more distinct assemblage of saproxylic species than high stumps. It can therefore be questioned whether high stumps are an optimal tool for nature conservation in clear-cutting forestry. Our results also indicate that low stumps constitute an equally important substrate as high stumps and logs, and we therefore suggest that stump harvesting is done after carefully evaluating measures to provide habitat for saproxylic organisms.

AB  - Loss of natural forests and decline in forest biodiversity has led to several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for conservation measures is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based conservation measures commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags.        Eight replicated sites for each of the three conservation measures were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species.        We found larger differences in species composition between conservation measures for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the conservation measures. There was considerable variation in response to conservation measures between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides.        Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the conservation measures, while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all conservation measures. We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies.

AB  - Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most species-rich habitats in Norway as well as in Europe. To maintain the biodiversity of hay meadows, it is important to understand local management regimes and the land use history that has shaped them and their biodiversity. There is however a general erosion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), related to hay meadows and other semi-natural habitats. This review aims to examine historical and written sources of land use practices related to hay meadows and to discuss the implications of a reintroduction of TEK in present and future management practices. Traditional land use practices and TEK obtained from written sources from four Norwegian regions and for the country as a whole are compared with present management practices. Written sources show that hay meadows have been managed in a complex but flexible way. Today's management regimes of hay meadows in Norway are streamlined and strongly simplified, most often involving only one late mowing and in some cases grazing. This simplification may result in loss of biodiversity. The potential to include more variety of management practices in hay meadows, by utilizing knowledge from written sources more systematically in combination with farmers' experienced knowledge (TEK) should be better utilized. Such an approach may secure both the biodiversity in hay meadows and TEK for the future. Former and present landscape ecological contexts in the infield-outlying land system show that management should be done for larger landscapes rather than small, isolated hay meadows, to optimize biodiversity conservation. For this study, we conducted a Norwegian literature review, based on ethnographical and ethnobotanical sources, as well as historical and present agricultural statistics, historical maps, results from research projects, and other sources. Our findings are discussed with similar European studies focusing on the historical management of hay meadows.

AB  - This paper looks at the strategies needed for the conservation and sustainable use of some of Europe's most fragile ecosystems: mountain habitats. Despite their appearance as wildscape, many traditional mountain ecosystems are semi-natural habitats whose character has been shaped by past forms of land use management. In some cases, this symbiosis has evolved over many centuries, even millennia, giving a deceptive natural stability to the ecosystems involved. However, as mountain areas across Europe have been drawn into more specialised forms of farm production, the progressive abandonment of traditional husbandry practices, including range grazing by livestock, has led to a reduction and fragmentation of those ecosystems and to the loss of key species within them. Using two sample mountain areas, the Scottish Highlands and Jotunheimen of Norway, this paper focuses on how the presence of particular ecosystems and species needs to be seen within a specific rather than generalised framework of traditional land use management. It will reconstruct this framework, highlighting the differences between the two sample areas and showing how their traditional resource management has contributed to the ecological dynamics of traditional mountain habitats. Drawing on detailed field data at both a community and species level, it will highlight the effect that changes to this traditional resource management have had on mountain habitats.

AB  - In this study, we document the habitat (substrate) requirements of the red-listed fungus Phellinus nigrolimitatus and assess the effect of forest management (forest age, amount of dead wood), climatic zone, topography, forest type, and site productivity on the occurrence of this fungus. We investigated 159 sample sites with different histories of logging activity, in four climatic zones in SE Norway and recorded the fungus on 93 out of 4146 inspected logs in 33 of the 159 sites. The fungus was clearly most frequent on Picea abies (5.8%) but we also found it on five Pinus sylvestris logs (0.4%). The frequency of the species depended highly upon the decay class and diameter of the logs. We never found P. nigrolimitatus on recently dead logs and only once on a weakly decayed log. The frequency increased sharply on moderately decayed logs and even further on very decayed logs. We rarely found the species on small spruce logs, but found it on nearly a quarter of spruce logs in the diameter class >40 cm. P. nigrolimitatus exhibited a clear trend in being more frequent on spruce logs in highly productive sites compared to logs in sites of medium and low productivity. Furthermore, R nigrolimitatus showed a clear trend in being systematically more frequent from young to old-growth forest. When we related the frequency directly to the forest management history, as defined by the coarse woody debris profile, it turned out that the fungus was found on 35% of the suitable logs in the stands that had been unmanaged for several tree generations, while it was found on 4-9% of the suitable logs in managed forests. We found an average frequency reduction of 82% from natural forests to managed forests when we compared similar substrates. This frequency reduction in combination with reduced substrate availability suggests a population decline larger than 95% from the period before widespread logging, several centuries ago, until today.

AB  - Northern European peatlands are important habitats for biological conservation because they support rich biodiversity and unique species compositions. However, historical management of peatland habitats has had negative consequences for biodiversity and their degradation remains a major conservation concern. Despite increasing awareness of the conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peat land species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40% in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981-2014 (speed of decline 1.5%/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50% (2.0% annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20% during 1997-2014 (1.0% annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, where the majority of open peatlands are protected, showed a 40% increase during 1981-2014 (1.0% annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of rustic bunting, which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity.

AB  - There is increasing pressure to manage forests for multiple objectives, including ecosystem services and biodiversity, alongside timber production. However, few forests are currently co-managed for timber and wildlife, despite potential economic and conservation benefits. We present empirical data from a commercial Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) production system in southern Norway in which moose (Alces alces) are an important secondary product. Combining long-term hunting and forestry records, we identified temporal variation in clear-felling over the past five decades, peaking in the 1970s. Herbicide treatment of regenerating stands and a fivefold increase in moose harvest has lead to a reduction in availability of successional forest per moose of > 90 % since the 1960s. Field estimates showed that spraying with the herbicide glyphosate reduced forage availability by 60 and 96 % in summer and winter, respectively, 4 years after treatment. It also reduced moose use and habitat selection of young spruce stands compared with unsprayed stands. Together these lines of evidence suggest that forest management led to an increase in moose carrying capacity during the 1970s and a subsequent decline thereafter. This is likely to have contributed to observed reductions in moose population productivity in southern Norway and is counter to sustainable resource management. We therefore call for better integration and long-term planning between forestry and wildlife management to minimise forest damage and the development of large fluctuations in ungulate populations.

AB  - The making of high-stumps to benefit wood living organisms is a common practice in Scandinavian forestry. To minimise the cost of this action trees of low quality, e.g. rotten trees, are chosen if possible. In this study we investigated if the wood decay fungi Heterobasidion spp. affects saproxylic beetles assemblages in Norway spruce (Picea abies) high-stumps. In total we caught 43 species of saproxylic beetles (Coleoptera) of which one was red-listed. Associations with the fungi were tested on 13 beetle species and three of them showed negative associations with the occurrence of Heterobasidion, while none of the tested species showed a positive association with Heterobasidion. Species richness did not differ between infected (30) and non-infected (33) stumps, but the beetle assemblages differed to some extent. Two additional bracket fungi species were found on some of the high-stumps, Fomitopsis pinicola and Trichaptum spp. Both these fungi had beetle species significantly associated with them. Interestingly, we found that F pinicola and Trichaptum spp. never occurred together in the same stumps. None of them, however, seemed to be affected by presence of Heterobasidion spp. In conclusion, Heterobasidion spp. infections influence the beetle fauna by disfavouring some beetle species but we did not find any species positively associated with Heterobasidion spp. This suggests that increasing the proportion of pre-rotten high-stumps could have a negative effect on beetle diversity on clear-cuts.

AB  - Large herbivores are capable of modifying entire ecosystems with a combination of direct (for example browsing/grazing, trampling, defecation) and indirect (for example affecting plant species composition that then alters soil properties) effects. With many ungulate populations increasing across the northern hemisphere it is important to develop a general theory for how these animals can be expected to impact their habitats. Here we present the results of an 8-year experimental exclusion of moose (Alces alces) from 15 recent boreal forest clear-cut sites in Central Norway. We used standard univariate techniques to describe the treatment effect on multiple forest and soil properties and combined this with a multivariate Bayesian network structure learning approach to objectively assess the potential mechanistic pathways for indirect effects on soils and soil fertility. We found that excluding moose had predictable direct effects, such as increasing the ratio of deciduous to coniferous tree biomass and the canopy cover and decreasing soil bulk density and temperature. However, we found no treatment effects on any measures of soil processes or quality (decomposition, nitrogen availability, C/N ratio, pH, nutrient stocks), and furthermore, we found only limited evidence that the direct effects had cascading (indirect) effects on soils. These findings oppose the commonly held belief that moose exclusion will increase soil fertility, but still highlights the strong ability of moose to directly modify forested ecosystems.

AB  - During the last decade, several well-publicized grazing-related incidents of vegetation degradation have helped to form an official opinion of overutilization of some mountain areas and a concern that Swedish reindeer husbandry may not be ecologically sustainable. We examine these examples in a temporal and management perspective to assess the scale of impact on summer grazing grounds in the Swedish mountains. Long-term data on population dynamics of reindeer show no trend with fluctuations around 225 000 animals for the last century. Data on grazing effects from Langfjallet (Dalarna) and Mittaklappen (Harjedalen) are discussed in detail. We compare these data to the situation in Finnmark, Norway, and in northern Finland where reindeer husbandry in recent decades does not seem to have been ecologically sustainable. We conclude that large-scale overexploitation by reindeer in the Swedish mountains is not evident. However, strong grazing and trampling effects may be found around enclosures and fences.

AB  - This paper addresses the perceptions of actors of protected areas in Norway about a co-management regime at the local level. The analysis is based on quantitative data from surveys of actors of eight protected areas in northern Norway. The surveys were undertaken just before a change to co-management in 2010. The results show that the two strongest determinants that explain actors' initial support of the governance change as a means to alleviate conflict are (i) the relationship of actors to the protected areas in terms of knowledge of the protected areas and mental models on conservation and (ii) the economic relevance of the areas for them. Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sami), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives. We build on the quantitative findings on actors' perceptions to develop a broader discussion on the relationship of the new management model for protected areas implemented and conflict resolution on land conservation in the country.

AB  - Forest ecosystems provide a variety of services, from climate regulation to biodiversity conservation. Temporary land cover variations such as those related to forest management can contribute to climate change through both biogeochemical (carbon, warming) and biophysical (albedo, cooling) mechanisms. As global rising demand for biomass for energy and materials can contribute to biodiversity losses, there is an evident need for integrated assessments of climate and biodiversity impacts to investigate possible trade-offs and synergies. We explore the integration of impacts on climate change and biodiversity from forest harvest for three case studies based on forest plantations in Norway. We focus on impacts from land disturbance after clear-cutting using three plots of one ha each of homogeneous forest in two ecoregions in Norway involving three different tree species: spruce, pine and birch. We use existing ecoregion specific characterization factors (CFs) to quantify occupation, short-term and long-term transformation impacts of land use on biodiversity loss for five taxonomic groups: mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants at regional and global level. For climate change impacts, we quantify the contributions of CO2 fluxes and changes in albedo. We estimate CFs for two complementary climate metrics, namely global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP) for time horizons of 20 and 100 years and quantify impacts in CO2 equivalents. We pursue the integration of impacts on climate and biodiversity from a time perspective: very short (GVVP20 and land occupation), medium (GWP100 and land transformation within 100 years) and long (GTP100 and land transformation after 100 years). We find CFs from -0.21 to 1.6 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for carbon emissions, and from -0.03 to -1.4 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for albedo changes, while net characterized impacts range from -44.8 t CO2-eq./ha (GTP100, spruce) to 93.25 t CO2-eq./ha (GWP20, spruce). Damages to biodiversity range from 4.76 * 10(-13) to 6.24 *10(-8) global species eq. lost per ton of carbon harvested. Our results reinforce the notion that spatially and temporally explicit analyses are vital when assessing life-cycle impacts from land derived products. We show that the existing set of multiple and complementary indicators for climate charige and biodiversity impacts can be integrated into a common framework to better inform about the complex heterogeneities of the forest ecosystem response to disturbances. We argue for a more frequent consideration of integrated impacts on biodiversity and climate change from forestry operations to better highlight possible co-benefits or adverse side-effects of forest management strategies.

AB  - Forest biomass has become a viable alternative energy source for replacing fossil fuels, particularly after the European Union acknowledged its sustainability status. To reach zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 in Sweden, new efficient methods of biomass extraction, such as geometrical biomass thinnings, are being explored and tested. These machine-based methods involve the extraction of above-ground biomass in narrow, 1-2 m-wide strips between extraction racks. While evidence-based optimization of biomass extraction mostly focuses on time- and cost-efficiency and on stand growth, criteria such as tree diversity are often overlooked. However, with ongoing climate change, tree diversity is crucial to strengthening the resilience and productivity of future forests, which also enhance the provision of ecosystem services and overall biological diversity. Therefore, we studied the effects of different biomass thinning strategies on spatial tree diversity in southern Sweden using nearest-neighbour summary statistics. We found scientific evidence that different geometrical designs of biomass thinning, especially in 1 or 2 m-wide strips, resulted in higher spatial tree diversity compared to conventional biomass thinning. Hence, in mixed conifer-broadleaved forests, biomass thinning in 1 or 2 m-wide strips is recommended for maintaining spatial tree diversity.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation resulting from anthropogenic land-use change may negatively affect both biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function. However, susceptibility to fragmentation varies between species and may be influenced by for instance specialization, functional traits and trophic level. We examined how total and specialist species richness, species composition and functional trait composition at two trophic levels (vascular plants and sap-feeding hoppers) vary with habitat fragmentation (patch size and connectivity) in dry calcareous grasslands in southeast Norway. We found that fragmentation affected plant and hopper species composition both totally and of habitat specialists, but with a net species loss only for the specialists, indicating greater susceptibility of specialized species. Reductions in patch size and increasing isolation negatively affected plant specialists with different sets of traits, effectively reducing the number of species with trait combinations suitable to persist in small and isolated patches. Fragmentation influenced trait composition of the total hopper community, but not of habitat specialists. A lesser degree of habitat association could explain why hoppers, despite belonging to a higher tropic level, seemed to be less susceptible to fragmentation than plants. Nonetheless, our study shows that habitat fragmentation affects both species richness, species composition and trait composition of plants and hoppers, indicating that fragmentation leads not only to a loss of species, but also alters dominance hierarchies and the functionality of grassland communities.

AB  - The amount of dead wood in forests has decreased owing to modern forest practices, and many species associated with this habitat are currently threatened. In Sweden during the last decade, naturally downed logs have been retained and, at clearcuts, high stumps have been artificially created to maintain saproxylic (dead wood dependent) insects. We tested how much these types of dead wood are used by sampling saproxylic beetles in dead wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.; Pinaceae) in managed forests in central Sweden. To analyse how surveys should be conducted in these kinds of studies, we compared three methods over an entire growing season. We found that the relationship between the type of dead wood and species richness was statistically significant when we used bark sieving and emergence traps, but not when we used window traps. It is impossible to ascertain whether beetles collected with window traps are related to the type of dead wood on which they are found and, therefore, such traps are less useful in studies of specific substrates. The yield from sieving was highest in spring and autumn, whereas species richness in window trap samples peaked in June and July and that in emergence traps peaked from May to July. With emergence traps we collected, on average, about twice the number of species over the whole season as we did by sieving on a single occasion in the spring. Both emergence trapping and sieving reveal what is present in individual pieces of dead wood, but these methods sample partly different faunas. We found fewer species on artificially created high stumps (on clearcuts); however, these stumps seem to be useful for some red-listed species.

AB  - Sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands induced by mountain summer farming in Budalen, central Norway, can be divided into two main habitats: small enclosures at each summer farm site, and the pastures surrounding them. Enclosures are exposed to different land-use regimes including grazing, mowing, fertilisation and soil disturbance. Pastures have never been fertilised or ploughed and the current grazing pressure is moderate. All investigated pastures are former haymaking areas. Higher conservation values of pastures compared to enclosures is reflected both in patterns of species richness and the occurrence of vulnerable species. Higher species richness in pastures is related to lower nutrient levels, lower loss of ignition in the soil, and higher levels of pH. Vulnerable species are concentrated in species-rich pastures, and have tow local abundance and regional distribution. Enclosures reflect a complexity in land-use, were the effects of mowing, fertilising and ploughing on plant community patterns could not be separated. Tree and shrub species are common in both habitats, and indicate a successional invasion of woody species. Maintenance of land-uses that have created semi-natural grasslands in the long term perspective (grazing, cutting of trees and shrubs, and mowing) is necessary to prevent forest succession, and a prerequisite for future conservation of sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Dead wood is a critical resource for biodiversity in boreal forests. We analysed the persistence of five model species inhabiting dead wood. By parameterising a metapopulation model (the incidence function model), the model species were all assigned characteristics that makes it likely that they have disappeared from some (20%) forest landscapes with a long history of forest management. In the metapopulation model, a forest stand (5 ha) was regarded as a habitat patch. The amount of habitat in each patch was obtained from models of dead wood dynamics of Norway spruce in central Sweden. Dead wood generated by altered management over the entire landscape was found to be less efficient in reducing extinction risks in comparison to the same amount of dead wood generated by protecting reserves. Because generation of dead wood by altered management is often less expensive than setting aside reserves, it is difficult to determine which conservation measure is most cost-efficient. In a landscape subjected to forestry for the first time, it was better to preserve a few large reserves than many small ones. However, in a managed, highly fragmented forest landscape it was better to set aside many small reserves. The reason for this was that small plots with high habitat quality could be selected, while large reserves originally contained habitats both of high and low quality, and the rate of habitat quality increase was low. A strategy for biodiversity conservation in a managed forest landscape should include information about the history of the landscape, the current amount and spatial distribution of forest habitats, and the potential for rapid restoration of forest habitats, both on managed and unmanaged forest land.

AB  - Alnus glutinosa (alder) swamp woodlands are in danger of disappearing in Europe and, in Norway, several habitats with alder are threatened. Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site, Rambjora, in western Norway encompasses the Rambjara Landscape Protected Area. We combined information from three sources recent alder swamp woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history to reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambjora in relation to land-use. Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland over 2800 years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment. The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, hay mowing, and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting) should be part of the future management in order to maintain the biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambjora. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys, pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when establishing conservation strategies. Our findings need to be considered in future conservation and restoration of ecosystems with alder swamp woodlands. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a comparative study we investigated woodpecker abundance in forest landscapes with different proportion of native pine forest and spruce plantations in western Norway. In 100 circular study plots of 100 ha each we recorded 38 white- backed - Dendrocopos leucotos, 22 grey- headed - Picus canus, 13 great spotted - Dendrocopos major, 6 green - Picus viridis, and 2 lesser spotted - Dendrocopos minor woodpeckers in the breeding season. The mean number of recorded woodpecker species peaked at 20 - 40% spruce plantations. The two most common species in the study, the white- backed and the grey- headed woodpeckers are both Red-listed species in Norway and among the rarest woodpeckers in Europe. The white- backed woodpecker preferred plots with higher than average proportions of standing dead trees and deciduous trees, and low proportions of spruce plantations in the plots. The grey-headed woodpecker preferred plots in the western ( coastal) parts of the study area with presence of large aspen Populus tremula trees. Logistic regression models did not reveal any clear threshold values with respect to proportion of spruce plantations in plots, although both woodpecker species were extremely rare in plots with > 60% spruce plantations. We recommend spruce plantations to be kept at moderate levels to ensure viable populations of woodpeckers in western Norway.

AB  - 1. A major challenge in biodiversity conservation is to facilitate viable populations of large apex predators in ecosystems where they were recently driven to ecological extinction due to resource conflict with humans.        2. Monetary compensation for losses of livestock due to predation is currently a key instrument to encourage human-carnivore coexistence. However, a lack of quantitative estimates of livestock losses due to predation leads to disagreement over the practice of compensation payments. This disagreement sustains the human-carnivore conflict.        3. The level of depredation on year-round, free-ranging, semi-domestic reindeer by large carnivores in Fennoscandia has been widely debated over several decades. In Norway, the reindeer herders claim that lynx and wolverine cause losses of tens of thousands of animals annually and cause negative population growth in herds. Conversely, previous research has suggested that monetary predator compensation can result in positive population growth in the husbandry, with cascading negative effects of high grazer densities on the biodiversity in tundra ecosystems.        4. We utilized a long-term, large-scale data set to estimate the relative importance of lynx and wolverine predation and density-dependent and climatic food limitation on claims for losses, recruitment and population growth rates in Norwegian reindeer husbandry.        5. Claims of losses increased with increasing predator densities, but with no detectable effect on population growth rates. Density-dependent and climatic effects on claims of losses, recruitment and population growth rates were much stronger than the effects of variation in lynx and wolverine densities.        6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis provides a quantitative basis for predator compensation and estimation of the costs of reintroducing lynx and wolverine in areas with free-ranging semi-domestic reindeer. We outline a potential path for conflict management which involves adaptive monitoring programmes, open access to data, herder involvement and development of management strategy evaluation (MSE) models to disentangle complex responses including multiple stakeholders and individual harvester decisions.

AB  - Habitat discontinuity, anthropogenic disturbance, and overharvesting have led to population fragmentation and decline worldwide. Preservation of remaining natural genetic diversity is crucial to avoid continued genetic erosion. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is an ideal model species for studying anthropogenic influences on genetic integrity, as it has experienced significant genetic alterations throughout its natural distribution range due to habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, translocations, and stocking. The Pasvik River is a subarctic riverine system shared between Norway, Russia, and Finland, subdivided by seven hydroelectric power dams that destroyed about 70% of natural spawning and nursing areas. Stocking is applied in certain river parts to support the natural brown trout population. Adjacent river segments with different management strategies (stocked vs. not stocked) facilitated the simultaneous assessment of genetic impacts of dams and stocking based on analyses of 16 short tandem repeat loci. Dams were expected to increase genetic differentiation between and reduce genetic diversity within river sections. Contrastingly, stocking was predicted to promote genetic homogenization and diversity, but also potentially lead to loss of private alleles and to genetic erosion. Our results showed comparatively low heterozygosity and clear genetic differentiation between adjacent sections in nonstocked river parts, indicating that dams prevent migration and contribute to genetic isolation and loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was low and heterozygosity relatively high across stocked sections. However, in stocked river sections, we found signatures of recent bottlenecks and reductions in private alleles, indicating that only a subset of individuals contributes to reproduction, potentially leading to divergence away from the natural genetic state. Taken together, these results indicate that stocking counteracts the negative fragmentation effects of dams, but also that stocking practices should be planned carefully in order to ensure long-term preservation of natural genetic diversity and integrity in brown trout and other species in regulated river systems.

AB  - Large uprooted trees are typical old-forest structures that provide distinct microsites for sessile organisms. While the habitat value of treefall pits for plants is relatively well known, the characteristic exposed root-plates of treefall mounds, which may require different management, have received less attention. The aim of the current study was to explore key factors of lichen incidence and their community characteristics on root-plates. We mapped and described treefall mounds in 24 stands (2 ha each) in a balanced design representing mixed stands of two site types (mesotrophic; drained swamp) and two management types (old growth, mature commercial forest) in hemiboreal Estonia. First, the occurrence of any lichens and of a specialized pin lichen, Chaenotheca furfuracea, was recorded on all 1207 mounds found. According to multi-level logistic regression models, their incidence depended on every mound-scale variable tested: there were independent positive effects of root-plate area and treefall age, spruce treefall, and the absence of exposed pit. In contrast, weak stand-scale effects only appeared when their interactions with mound-scale variables were included or some main effects were eliminated. C. furfuracea also occurred more frequently where other inhabited root-plates were nearby, and such dispersal limitation interacted with habitat quality. Secondly, full lichen communities were described in detail on a subsample of 84 root-plates of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Altogether 48 lichen species were recorded, including eight red-listed or nationally rare species. The communities on large fresh root-plates and in mature drained stands had distinct species composition, while communities of older mounds and in old-growth stands converged in species composition. We conclude that lichen incidence on root-plates is mostly determined by colonization probability, and commercial forests can support a diverse lichen biota when large treefall mounds, particularly of P. abies and of >10 years age are provided. However, given some differences of lichen communities in old growth, and because treefall issues conflict with other management objectives in commercial forests, optimised management of treefall areas there should be complemented by their strict protection in reserves.

AB  - Nature conservation in Norway is based on the idea that wilderness and forest nature reserves should be left to develop naturally. Several studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found. It is concluded that to ensure successful conservation of the biodiversity of these and other such forests, former land use practices should be documented, and management schemes should be developed on the basis of the acquired knowledge.

AB  - The boreal rainforest in Central Norway is rich in rare and (or) red-listed epiphytic lichens but is subject to forest harvesting. Natural old Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. forests have been replaced increasingly by dense, even-aged plantations. This study aims at increasing our knowledge about populations of old forest associated lichens in P. abies plantations. In differently aged plantations, we measured occurrence of six lichen species and the population size and reproductive effort of :five lichen species. We found that the success of colonizing plantations differed because of species-specific constraints and needs, and that species occurrence depended on stand age and branch quality. A high number of reproducing thalli and small juvenile thalli of the cyanolichen Lobaria scrobiculata (Scop.) DC. and the pendulous lichen Ramalina thrausta (Ach.) Nyl. suggest effective recruitment within plantations. The populations of the cyanolichens Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. and Pseudocphellaria crocata (L.) Vain, were too small to be viable and demand special concern to survive in managed forests. The abundance of old forest associated lichens in a managed boreal rainforest could be promoted by a varied and heterogeneous branch structure, increased rotation periods (increase the value of plantations as propagule sources), small clearcuts and retention trees (shorten the distance between sources of propagules and target substrate), and maintaining Salix and Sorbus trees (important host trees for cyanolichens and thereby important dispersal sources).

AB  - Finns' preferences about forests and forestry in Finland were clarified via a questionnaire mailed to a sample of citizens. Maintaining the health of forests was regarded the most important objective of forest management. Also forest landowners found that aspect most valuable in the management of their own forests. Wood production and employment got surprisingly low priority compared with other modes of use and values of forests. The results demonstrate the multiple-use nature of the utilization of forests in Finland. Although biodiversity was regarded as quite important, a majority was not ready to pay more taxes for maintaining it. Slightly more than half of the respondents accepted clear-felling of forest. Most would, however, like to see a maximum size set for clear-felling areas. Nearly one out of two of the respondents were of the opinion that the area of forest land under conservation should be increased. Some differences between opinions of different strata were observed. Generally, in the light of public opinion, recent years' changes in forest management directives to more environmental friendly practices in Finland appear to be correct.

AB  - In Northern Europe, human activities have caused a substantial decrease in the number of old deciduous trees over the last two centuries, leading to a decline in species populations associated with this habitat. One way to mitigate this trend is to increase the abundance of mature and old deciduous trees in commercial forests, such as by tree retention at final harvest. We analysed the biodiversity value of retained mature oaks in the production forests of Norway spruce in southern Sweden, using oaks in pastures as reference. The forest oaks were grown in two different levels of shade. We analysed two categories of saproxylic (i.e. dead wood-dependent) beetles: those utilizing oaks (Group I) and those utilizing oak but not spruce (Group II, which was, therefore, a subcategory of Group I). We found that forest oaks sustained high beetle diversity, in particular, Group I beetles, which were significantly more abundant in forest oaks in heavily thinned patches, as compared with pasture oaks and oaks in moderately thinned patches. For both beetle groups, the composition differed between the forest oaks and pasture oaks, indicating that the forest oaks can be a complementary habitat to that of pasture oaks. There was a positive relationship between oak dead branch diameter and beetle biodiversity, but only for older oaks (similar to 200 years old). We conclude that retaining oaks in production spruce forests can increase the diversity of oak associated beetles at the landscape scale. Since many oak associated species depend on relatively high levels of insolation, management of retained oaks in production forests should include periodic removal of encroaching trees.

AB  - Aquaculture expansion is a political priority in Norway, despite simmering conflicts, and competing claims. We expand on this hypothesis and analyze the Norwegian governance system by adding stakeholder theory in case of a simulated model of the effects of municipal coastal zone planning in the municipality of Froya, Norway. One cannot analyze the governance system in Norway without fully comprehending the perspectives of the stakeholders involved. Different stakeholders will react and respond differently and have conflicting presumptions basing their actions toward the planning process for coastal areas. They will also have different levels of power and abilities to influence the system. The article presents the interdisciplinary, first generation development of an agent based simulation model that mimics the outcomes of coastal zone planning for a stakeholder groups, the commercial fishers and the aquaculture industry, based on qualitative input from legislation, regulations, and stakeholder workshops. We proceed with verifying the applicability of this simulator in light of the key actors involved, namely the commercial fishers. We found that the simulator had two outcomes for the commercial fishers that were consistently recurring, namely "collapse" and "stability," based on the simulated occurrences of complaints by the stakeholders, with the latter being the de facto perceptions of actuality by the commercial fishers. Using stakeholder theory, we argue that the aquaculture industry's role has the saliency of an Important Stakeholder in Froya has steered the commercial fishers, who has the role of Dependent Stakeholders according to stakeholder theory, to no longer see any legitimacy in the process in that their complaints were never upheld because of their lack of the attribute Power.

AB  - Logging and modern forest management reduced the frequency of key features of old-growth forest, especially old, dying and dead trees in the Scandinavian boreal forest during the 20th century. To quantify the decline and spatial differences, we have analysed density changes of old trees between 1926 and 1996 on a regional scale (approximately 50,000 kin 2) in boreal Sweden. The occurrence of old-conifer trees (+159 years) has dramatically decreased in the studied area and today only one third as many old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) can be found as in the 1920s. However, the density of old deciduous trees (+99 years) has not decreased since the early 20th century. Historical baseline data such as these are needed for modern forest management, conservation programmes and ecological restoration projects. Existing old trees are very important for biodiversity, and may also preserve elements of cultural heritage from pre-industrial times. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) are important pollinators in many ecosystems, but their diversity has declined in Europe during the past century, mainly due to habitat loss. However, some of the habitat requirements of wild bees are met in anthropogenic landscape elements, such as road sides, power-line strips and field edges. Moreover, as the bee species assemblages change throughout the season the habitat requirements of the bee fauna may change accordingly. Understanding such seasonally distinct responses of solitary bees with different phenologies may be of high value for local conservation planning. The purpose of this study was to examine if the habitat quality of field edges for solitary bees change throughout the season, and how this temporal variation relates to local habitat and landscape conditions. By sampling solitary bees in 18 field edges in southeast Norway throughout the season we found that the species richness and abundance of bees was highest in sun exposed field edges, independently of the season. However, we found phenologically distinct responses to the landscape context. Moreover, field edges situated in landscapes with a high proportion of forests and semi-natural landscape elements hosted the most phenologically diverse bee species assemblages. We conclude that in order to fulfil the habitat requirements of bee species assemblages throughout the season, one should conserve and direct habitat restoration schemes towards increasing sun exposure at field edges with a diverse flora and a high proportion of semi-natural areas in the vicinity.

AB  - In order to safeguard biodiversity in forest we need to know how forest policy instruments work. Here we use a nationwide network of 9400 plots in productive forest to analyze to what extent large-scale policy instruments, individually and together, target forest of high conservation value in Norway. We studied both instruments working through direct regulation; Strict Protection and Landscape Protection, and instruments working through management planning and voluntary schemes of forest certification; Wilderness Area and Mountain Forest. As forest of high conservation value (HCV-forest) we considered the extent of 12 Biodiversity Habitats and the extent of Old-Age Forest. We found that 22% of productive forest area contained Biodiversity Habitats. More than 70% of this area was not covered by any large-scale instruments. Mountain Forest covered 23%, while Strict Protection and Wilderness both covered 5% of the Biodiversity Habitat area. A total of 9% of productive forest area contained Old-Age Forest, and the relative coverage of the four instruments was similar as for Biodiversity Habitats. For all instruments, except Landscape Protection, the targeted areas contained significantly higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas not targeted by these instruments. Areas targeted by Strict Protection had higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas targeted by other instruments, except for areas targeted by Wilderness Area which showed similar proportions of Biodiversity Habitats. There was a substantial amount of spatial overlap between the policy tools, but no incremental conservation effect of overlapping instruments in terms of contributing to higher percentages of targeted HCV-forest. Our results reveal that although the current policy mix has an above average representation of forest of high conservation value, the targeting efficiency in terms of area overlap is limited. There is a need to improve forest conservation and a potential to cover this need by better targeting high conservation value areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat modification and fragmentation is considered one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. To develop effective conservation strategies towards such pressures we need to improve our understanding of how species richness and community composition are shaped by species' responses to landscape patterns. In this study we tested relationships between patch size and isolation, species richness and species traits in a fragmented landscape of calcareous grasslands-a diversity hotspot in Southern Norway. We recorded a total of 381 vascular plant species, of which 50 are considered habitat specialists, distributed among 86 habitat patches (50-9,475 m(2)) in 22 of 50 randomly sampled 500 x 500 m-plots. We found that large habitat patches held more species of both generalists and specialists than small habitat patches and that well-connected patches held more specialist species than isolated patches. About 1/3 of the habitat specialists in this study system showed vulnerability to isolation, i.e. lower probability of occurrence in isolated patches. Traits related both to persistence (short lifespan) and colonization ability (low seed production per plant) were predictors of vulnerability to isolation. Our results indicate that both colonization and extinction processes affect species composition and richness, and that the rescue-effect-mitigation of local, area-dependent extinctions through colonization-is reduced in isolated patches. These findings suggest that conservation strategies should place greater emphasis on the spatial configuration of the habitat network, and on the preservation of colonization processes to ensure regional persistence of species.

AB  - Environmental impact analysis (EIA) was developed in the USA in the late 1960s, but was not mandated in Norway as a tool for environmental planning until 1989. In this paper, we investigate how EIA in the Norwegian context contributes to the production of knowledge about the environment. Starting from the fairly broad diagnosis provided by the concepts of risk society (Ulrich Beck) and ecological modernization (Maarten Hajer), the assumption is that EIA is consistent with a discursive structure emphasizing particularistic, local and shortterm problems.        The study is based on an analysis of EIA guidelines provided by relevant government ministries and two case studies, one examining EIA in relation to a planned road development in Trondheim called 'Nordtangenten', the other investigating EIA in relation to plans for a new site for the furniture chain IKEA.        The results are consistent with expectations about particularism, localness and short-term point of view, but it seems as if the production of knowledge about the environment provided by EIA is less controlled by the discursive structure outlined by guidance manuals and procedures than originally assumed. While the constructors responsible for performing EIA are clearly disciplined by considerations about reducing the environmental impact, the EIA documents become partisan in putting the view that the projects under planning are environmentally sustainable.

AB  - Forests contribute to numerous ecosystem functions and services and contain a large proportion of terrestrial biodiversity, but they are being negatively impaced by anthropogenic activities. Forests that have never been clear-cut and have old growth characteristics, termed "near-natural," often harbor different and richer species assemblages than managed forests. Alternative management strategies may be able to balance the needs of biodiversity with the demands of forestry, but evaluation efforts are limited by the challenges of measuring biodiversity. Species richness is frequently used as a simple measure of biodiversity, but research indicates that it may not adequately capture community-level changes. Alternatively, trait-based measures of biodiversity may prove to be useful, but research is lacking. In this paper, we use a large dataset that includes 339 obligate saproxylic beetle species collected over a decade in the boreal region throughout southern Norway to: (1) establish if there is a difference in beetle community composition between near-natural and managed forests; and (2) determine which measures of beetle biodiversity best indicate forest naturalness. We arranged the sites in an ordination space and tested for differences in community composition between these forest types. We also tested different measures of biodiversity to determine which were the most predictive of forest naturalness. We found a clear difference in community composition between near-natural and managed forests. Additionally, three measures of biodiversity were most predictive of forest naturalness: proportional abundance of predators, community weighted mean (CWM) of wing length, and CWM of body roundness. The probability that a forest was near-natural increased with the proportional abundance of predators but decreased with CWM wing length and body roundness. Although species richness was higher in near-natural forests, the effect was not significant. Overall, our findings underscore the conservation value of near-natural forests and highlight the potential of several measures of biodiversity for determining forest quality.        There was a clear difference in saproxylic beetle community composition between near-natural and managed forest, and three measures of saproxylic beetle biodiversity were most predictive of forest naturalness: proportional abundance of predators, CWM of wing length and CWM of body roundness. Although species richness was higher in near-natural forest, the effect was not significant. Overall, our findings underscore the conservation value of near-natural forests and highlight the potential of these measures of biodiversity for determining forest quality.image

AB  - Since the Age of Enlightenment, modernization has taken the form of a parallel growth of the significance of both the state and the individual, at the expense of the intermediary or secondary groups or collectives of various kinds. With a modern notion of over-burdening and high transaction costs of the mature state and a disrupting alienation of the individual, the search for institutional solutions that are "neither market, nor state," has intensified in both academia and bureaucracies. However, such : efforts often clash with many of the values of modern Western society. In Northern Norway, the political struggle over the reintroduction of Commons Law for Mountain Areas revealed some of these contradictions. This example also shows why many sub-optimal solutions in modern resource management are favored because of the value attached to individual freedom and equal treatment by the state; even when these contradict the sustainable governing of a resource. In contrast, institutional designs based on smaller collectives are perceived as less attractive because they involve less individual freedom, more duties and more inequality. The lessons are used for a discussion of the role of common property institutions in the process of modernisation.

AB  - Grazing by large herbivores is well-known to influence plant communities, while much fewer studies have been carried out on grazing effects on invertebrates. In Norway, some 2.2 million sheep graze on outlying pastures during summer, most of them in the alpine zone, but no study has reported the relative impact of sheep grazing on invertebrate communities relative to other environmental factors such as the plant community and altitude. A fully replicated landscape-scale experiment (2.7 km(2)) was performed with no, low (25 per km(2)) and high (80 per km(2)) sheep densities in an alpine habitat of Norway (1050-1300 in a.s.l.). The increased vulnerability hypothesis (HI) predicts that the more folivorous invertebrates, the higher the grazing pressure by sheep, as large herbivore grazing may stress the plants so they are more vulnerable to insect herbivory. The increased defence hypothesis (H-2) predicts increased levels of general anti-herbivore defences, and thus a lower abundance of invertebrates with increasing sheep densities. Contrary to both predictions, no evidence was found that sheep grazing affected invertebrate richness, or abundance of folivorous, predatory or detritivore invertebrates - in a community dominated by Diptera and Hemiptera. Demonstrating an effect will always be a function of sample size, but at least our study shows that other environmental variables (such as plant species richness and functional plant richness) are more important determinants than sheep grazing for the selected invertebrate groups. Our study was short-term (first year of grazing) mainly designed to test specific hypotheses related to induced plant defences; long-term effects are probably owing to the impact sheep may have on vegetation composition, primary production, litter cover and soil properties.

AB  - Because of the limited spatial extent and comprehensiveness of protected areas, an increasing emphasis is being placed on conserving habitats which promote biodiversity within production forest. For this reason, alternative silvicultural programs need to be evaluated with respect to their implications for forest biodiversity, especially if these programs are likely to be adopted. Here we simulated the effect of varied rotation length and associated thinning regimes on habitat availability in Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests, with high and low productivity. Shorter rotation lengths reduced the contribution made by production trees (trees grown for industrial use) to the availability of key habitat features, while concurrently increasing the contribution from retention trees. The contribution of production trees to habitat features was larger for high productivity sites, than for low productivity sites. We conclude that shortened rotation lengths result in losses of the availability of habitat features that are key for biodiversity conservation and that increased retention practices may only partially compensate for this. Ensuring that conservation efforts better reflect the inherent variation in stand rotation lengths would help improve the maintenance of key forest habitats in production forests.

AB  - Negative consequences of human activities for biodiversity may be mitigated by compensation measures. Although the interest in applying compensation measures is generally increasing, such measures have rarely been applied in forestry. Many boreal forests are managed by clear felling and used for timber and pulp production. There is an increasing interest in intensifying forestry by also harvesting slash and stumps for biofuel at felling. We evaluated the efficiency of combining intensified forestry production with compensation measures, by estimating the net revenue from slash and stump harvest, the cost of high stump creation, and simulating habitat amount for 680 bark- and wood-living species (fungi, beetles, lichens, and bryophytes) in Norway spruce forests in Sweden under different scenarios of biofuel harvest and compensation. We show that the harvest of slash and stumps has a clear negative effect on the habitat amount available for many species, especially for many fungi and beetles. Combining slash harvesting with the creation of high stumps results in an economic surplus and at the same time provides significantly more habitat in comparison with no slash harvesting and no high stump creation. When undertaking stump harvesting it is currently impossible to achieve such positive effects. Thus, our analyses show that compensation can sometimes be a useful tool when both economic and biodiversity goals must be achieved in forestry, but in other cases it is a better alternative to avoid the activity that causes the negative effects.

AB  - Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

AB  - The replacement of some spruce monocultures with stands composed of planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and naturally regenerated birch (Betula spp.) has a range of potential benefits, but the implications for biodiversity are generally unknown. Here we conduct a paired replicated study in southern Sweden of the avian biodiversity found within Norway spruce monocultures, and within Norway spruce stands possessing approximately 20% birch. Our research leads us to three findings. First, avian diversity was significantly higher in the spruce birch polycultures. Second, spruce birch polycultures exclusively attracted broadleaf-associated bird species and retained the majority of conifer-associated bird species found in the spruce monocultures. Third, avian biodiversity within the spruce birch polycultures did not incorporate threatened taxa. We suggest that in addition to the apparent benefits for stand level diversity, widespread use of spruce birch polycultures could provide a means of softening the matrix for broadleaved-associated species, while concurrently providing an increased broadleaf base from which future conservation actions could be implemented. Our results are relevant to multi-use forestry, and recent policy initiatives by forest certification agencies which aim to increase broadleaf-associated biodiversity within conifer-dominated production forest landscapes.

AB  - In this study the variation in species richness, species composition and habitat specificity is examined among all land patches in a 43-ha landscape in W Norway, created by traditional agricultural management practices, with particular focus on the distribution of semi-natural grassland species, i.e. species known to be typical of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. In 2002 about one half of the study area was intensively managed for agricultural purposes, 19.3% was woodland and 14.4% was semi-natural grassland. The main vegetation gradient in the area reflected long-term management (land-use) intensity. Both species richness and habitat specificity decreased with increasing management intensity. Semi-natural grassland species occurred throughout the landscape, although with some concentration to semi-natural grasslands. The two measures of habitat specificity both peaked in semi-natural grasslands. Comparison of the present patterns of vascular plant distributions with information on past land-use derived from a map from 1865, indicate that species typical of semi-natural grasslands persist long after land use activities have come to an end and that there is an extinction debt in the vascular flora. The significant positive relationship between patches with high richness of species typical of semi-natural grasslands, remnant semi-natural grassland patches and man-made structures with long continuity, shows that restoring formerly open semi-natural grassland 'hot spots' in a agricultural landscapes is advantageous both for conservation of cultural and biological values.

AB  - In Fennoscandinan forestry, retention of forest strips as a buffer adjacent to water and bogs has long been recommended, but their biological value is poorly known and practice varies greatly. This study explored the value for breeding birds of retaining buffer strips of different width and structure, after clear-cutting in coniferous forest. The presence of birds during their nesting season was inventoried in 370 strips in south-eastern Norway. The species number per 100 m strip length increased with increasing strip width up to about 30 m width, and then remained constant up to 70 - 100 m width. Generalist species dominated all width categories. Important habitat factors other than strip width were basal area of spruce, short visibility and tree height. Although 11 - 20 m wide strips had the highest density of species and individuals per hectare, buffer strips of about 30 m width may be recommended, as narrower strips had fewer species per unit length of edge.

AB  - Finland, Norway and Sweden are characterized by small privately owned forest holdings, averaging only 60 hectares. The forests were over-exploited during the decades around the turn of the last century. Poor regeneration brought the prevalent partial cutting systems into discredit.        After the Second World War, the call for move efficiency and the development of new technology simplified forest operations. Clearcutting dominated, particularly on the larger estates. The regeneration of spruce, Picea abies, was often established by planting; while pine, Pinus sylvestris, was regenerated by natural seeding with seed frees.        The forest acts in the three countries in this period were focused on wood production. Today, revised forestry acts and regulations emphasize multiple use forestry and biodiversity. A larger variety of silvicultural systems, from clearcutting to selection cutting, will probably be practical in the future. Among forest owners and professionals on all levels there exists an increasing interest in ecologically-based silvicultural systems. Several research projects are now focused on multiple use forestry, biodiversity and silvicultural adaptation within sustainable utilization of the renewable resources.

AB  - Repeated fertilization of forests to increase biomass production is an environmentally controversial proposal, the effects of which we assessed on breeding birds in stands of young Norway spruce (Picea abies), in an intensively managed forest area in southern Sweden. Our results show that fertilized stands had 38% more species and 21% more individuals than unfertilized stands. Compared with stands under traditional management, the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds. We cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers. Future studies should focus on structural and compositional effects of fertilization processes during the entire rotation period and at assessing its effects in a landscape context.

Design/methodology/approach This paper illustrates the trend observed based on three major observations from Norway and links the observed trend to the micro-level to meso- and macro-trends. Findings As a result, it was found that due to irresponsible behavior the Norwegian allemansratten (Right to Roam) system is under pressure. Because of this, the freedom to enjoy the Norwegian nature risks to be limited by regulations. Originality/value The insights presented in this paper contribute to the debate on nature-based tourism, sustainable and responsible tourism and link with the debate on overtourism in the context of nature areas.

AB  - Analysing international forestry congresses and (by way of example) the exploration of Northern Norway and Finland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the article examines the changing conditions of natural resource management in the Baltic and North Sea regions. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, the overall increasing consumption of wood and the advancing timber frontier in Northern Europe questioned the Western European perception of Northern Europe as possessing inexhaustible woodlands. At the same time, the expanding railway network in Central Europe overran traditional (local) concepts of sustainable forest management. Since 1873, at international congresses, experts have debated the consequences of these spatial changes for the future prospects of forestry. On the one hand, pessimistic voices warned about a coming worldwide shortage of timber. On the other hand, optimistic statements saw the railway as a solution, as it allowed for timber to be transported wherever rails were laid. In the countries of the Baltic and North Sea regions, state authorities, as well as forestry academies, took up the debate and tried to improve their knowledge of accessible forest resources, for instance by sending expeditions to the woodlands of Northern Europe. The expanding railway network as well as the accumulation and cross border circulation of new knowledge about forest resources led to an ongoing process of resealing sustainability: forestry experts continuously tried to keep in step with the changing spatial conditions of forestry planning (timber frontier, railway network) and at the same time fostered these changes. Experts suggested and advocated either spatial limits - for instance laws for regional forest protection or - further spatial extensions - such as new railway lines or channels in - order to shape the spatial framework of future forest management.

AB  - One of the most important measures adopted in the new biodiversity-oriented forestry in Sweden is to increase the quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD) in commercially managed forests, by leaving existing dead trees as well as ensuring input of new dead trees. We have used a simulation model in order to predict the quantity of CWD of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in forest landscapes subject to different management regimes. It is shown that in an average, managed forest landscape in Sweden, where the management regimes are changed in order to follow the current requirements for certification by FSC, the amount of CWD will be more than doubled, but it will take more than 100 years to reach the-new level. The increase in the amount of CWD will first be recognised for hard (less decayed) CWD and mainly in young, newly cut stands. Leaving forests unmanaged, retaining living trees and decreasing the destruction of CWD at final cutting, and not removing naturally dying trees are all measures that have a strong positive influence on the amount of CWD.

AB  - In the future, a significant proportion of Northern forests may become intensively managed through the planting of monospecific stands of native or introduced trees, and the use of multiple silvicultural treatments such as forest fertilization. Such an intensification of management in selected parts of the landscape is suggested by different zoning models, for example the Triad approach, which is under evaluation in some regions of North America. In this study, based on Fennoscandian conditions, we predicted landscape-scale extinction risks of five hypothetical model insect species dependent on fresh dead wood from Norway spruce (Picea abies), by simulating colonizations and local extinctions in forest stands. Intensified forestry applied to 50% of the spruce stands led to strongly increased extinction risks of all species during the following 150 years. For one species-the sun-exposure specialist-there were strong effects already after 50 years. The negative effects of intensive plantation forestry could be compensated for by taking greater biodiversity conservation measures in other managed forests or by setting aside more forests. This is consistent with the Triad model, which is according to our analyzes an effective way to decrease extinction risks, especially for the short-dispersing species and the species associated with closed forest. A zoning of forest land into intensive forestry, conventional forestry, and set asides may be better at combining increased timber production and maintenance of biodiversity in comparison to landscapes where all production forests are managed in the same way.

AB  - Stump storage piles created at stump extraction are stored next to the extraction clear-cuts for 2 years. These storage piles may become a trap for saproxylic insects (dependent on dead wood) if they attract many breeding individuals, whose offspring are killed at biofuel processing. Stumps in clear-cuts are also an important habitat for many species and these species could be negatively affected by habitat loss when stumps are extracted.        In a field study, we therefore estimated the trap effect for the saproxylic beetle fauna in stump storage piles. We also estimated the habitat loss and population decrease that was the result of stump extraction. Beetle density and habitat amounts were estimated in stump storage piles, extraction clear-cuts, and ordinary clear-cuts. In each of eight (six for piles) replicates, beetles were sampled from ten Norway spruce Picea abies stumps, by means of bark sieving, in each habitat (220 stumps in total).        Stump extraction reduced the P. abies stump volume by 76%. The concomitant decrease in beetle community abundance was 70%, a decrease from 9109 to 2692 beetles per hectare. A conservative estimate is that between 5.2% and 23.1% of the beetles "produced" at the stump extraction site were killed at stump pile removal. Our results indicated that the stump storage piles were a severe ecological trap for four individual species. However, a lower community density of beetles in stump storage piles compared to surrounding extraction clear-cuts, indicate that stump storage piles did not constitute a community-wide ecological trap.

AB  - This paper analyses the impacts on timber and forest products markets of increasing forest conservation in Norway. A partial equilibrium forest sector model is applied to analyse effects on roundwood and forest products prices, quantities and trade of four alternative conservation extents. These alternatives are based on a recent biological analysis of the conservation needs in order to protect biodiversity in Norway. Roundwood prices are projected to increase moderately when conservation increases domestically only, since the Norwegian forest industry substitutes imported fibre for domestic. The impacts on roundwood prices are more substantial if also Norway's forest products trading partners increase the forest conservation. If forest owners voluntarily conserve forests subject to an economic compensation ( which currently is the most likely policy in Norway), the model results imply that forest owners on average are better off with increased conservation. Domestic sawnwood production is projected to reduce when assuming increasing forest conservation, while the production level in the pulp and paper industry is almost unaffected in the short-run. Finally, increasing demand for forest products as a result of "environmental good-will'' may increase roundwood prices and harvest levels in unaffected forest areas significantly.

AB  - This study aims to assess the degree of regularity in the effect of patch size and patch shape on plant species richness across a macroscale region, and to evaluate the implications for nature conservation.        Our study area covers south-eastern Norway and contains 16 agricultural landscapes with 2162 patches.        To analyse regularity a local linear mixed model (LLMM) was applied. This procedure estimates the richness trends due to shared effects of size and shape, and simultaneously provides the landscape-specific random effect. The latter is a direct estimate of the degree of irregularity between the landscapes, conditioned on specific values of size and shape.        The results show a positive interaction between the shape and size of patches, which is repeated for all landscapes. The shape of the patches produces more regular patterns in species richness than the size of patches. This we attribute to effects of dispersal and distance to neighbouring patches of different environmentally conditioned species pools. Large and complex patches have shorter average distance to neighbouring patches (of different types) than large simple-shaped (circular) patches have. We attribute the higher species richness of the former, given a similar area, to a higher number of species dispersed from the outside into the more complex plot. For small patches, however, the distance to the edge is short relative to normal dispersal distances, for patches of all shapes. This explains why the positive effect of shape complexity on species richness is stronger for large patches. This interpretation is supported by a strong spatial correlation conditioned on the most complex patches.        Theories of dynamics in biodiversity in patchy landscapes must consider shape as a regulator at the same level as size, and both shape and size of patches should be simultaneously taken into account for management planning.

AB  - In this paper we examine the influence of geographical and land-use factors on breeding bird species richness in small woods within farmland. In many European agricultural landscapes, small woods represent the major component of semi-natural habitat available to wildlife. We used census data (for woods of up to 15 ha) from six study areas in four countries (The Netherlands, U.K., Denmark and Norway) to construct species-area relationships for woodland birds. An additional relationship for Sweden was obtained from the literature. Species richness, and the parameters of the species-area relationships, were then related to the latitude, longitude and percentage woodland cover of each study area. Overall, species richness across all woods in each study area declined with increasing latitude; the proportion of resident species also declined, but that of migrants increased. Numbers of migrant species also increased with increasing woodland cover. Both the slopes and intercepts of the species-area relationships declined with increasing latitude. Thus not only were fewer species available to colonise individual woods at higher latitudes, but the return in terms of species richness for a given increase in area was also less than at lower latitudes. From the species-area relationships, the numbers of species expected to breed in woods of 1 ha and of 15 ha decreased from 13 and 21, respectively, in The Netherlands (latitude 51.7 degrees) to 7 and 13, respectively, in Denmark (latitude 56.3 degrees). Other factors influencing species richness on both local and geographical scales are discussed.

AB  - 1. Stump extraction for bio energy is a new forestry activity and before large-scale implementation occurs, it is important to analyse its consequences. Saproxylic beetles depend on dead trees and stump extraction will reduce the amount of habitat available for this group.        2. Early warning signs of impending regional species extinctions were looked for in areas where stump harvest has only been conducted for about 3years. In a paired design (N=8), the beetle fauna was sampled in stumps on ordinary clear-cuts and on clear-cuts from which stumps had been extracted. Sampling in extraction clear-cuts was possible because 25% of the stump volume was retained. Samples were collected by bark sieving ten Norway spruce, Picea abies, stumps per clear-cut.        3. In total, 6959 individuals of 46 species were found. Several early warning signs were seen: stump extraction reduced the number of species per stump and per clear-cut and reduced the species evenness in individual stumps.        4. Species at higher trophic levels (predators and fungivores), in particular, suffered negative effects. Stump extraction reduced the number of species of fungivores and facultative predators/fungivores at the clear-cut level and reduced the relative abundance of predators at the stump level.        5. These results indicate that if stumps are extracted from a high proportion of the clear-cuts in a region, the present recommendations of leaving 15-25% of the stump volume will be insufficient for preserving the beetle fauna in the stumps. Further studies are needed to identify levels of stump retention that do not lead to species loss.

AB  - Roads affect wildlife in many direct and indirect ways. For ungulates, roads may inhibit seasonal migration and may cause an effective loss of habitat due to avoidance. On the other hand, roadsides and associated agricultural lands offer high quality forage that may attract ungulates and increase the frequency of car accidents. Mitigating actions require detailed knowledge on space use in relation to roads. Using data from 67 global positioning system (GPS)-marked red deer in Norway, we quantified 1) scale of avoidance of roads, 2) crossing frequency, and 3) selection of crossing sites. Red deer avoided roads only on a very local scale and only during daytime, with minor influence of variation in road size (traffic burden). Marked red deer crossed roads, on average, 2 times per day. Females crossed more frequently than males and crossings were most frequent during autumn and winter and during night. Deer selected forested crossing sites close to agricultural pastures, reflecting that roads are crossed most often on nightly feeding excursions. Our findings imply that red deer in our study area have adjusted to exploit feeding habitat close to roads at times of low traffic burden. The high frequency of crossings suggests a limited influence on seasonal migration patterns. The frequency at which red deer cross highways suggests that mitigation measures to reduce road mortality may be effective if targeted in the right areas. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The debate about whether proactive (focused on irreplaceable species) or reactive (focused on vulnerable species) conservation is more effective usually focuses on the global or multinational scale and knowledge of how these principles interact on-the-ground is lacking. Here we use the first long-term dataset on an entire oak-living beetle community in hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) to ask whether policy-driven conservation actions aimed at vulnerable species can also be proactive for unthreatened, but irreplaceable species. Hollow oaks are vital keystone structures that are rich in both vulnerable and irreplaceable wood-living beetles. We sampled in excess of 23,000 individuals from 307 species over four seasons, across the oak range in Norway. We assessed the importance of key environmental variables for vulnerable, irreplaceable and generalist species. We show that simple management actions taken to benefit vulnerable species in hollow trees could also contribute to preventing the decline of important, irreplaceable species. Clearing regrowth is predicted to increase vulnerable species richness by 75-100%, specialist richness by 65%, and to benefit two generalist species. Regrowth clearance is likely to be similarly beneficial in all oak-based habitats with hollow trees across Europe and North America. Increased oak circumference and local habitat quantity were also beneficial for species richness and influenced species composition. Based on this we provide advice for targeting conservation action. We suggest economic, carbon and recreational benefits of clearance that could increase the attractiveness of conservation for policy-makers. We show the importance of examining large-scale conservation planning principles at a local scale to elicit how they work on the ground where conservation actually happens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - 1. Capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan mortality resulting from collisions with high tension power lines (11-420 kV) was estimated, based on the number of casualties found per kilometre of power line patrolled in three boreal forest and low alpine areas.        2. The length (km) of high tension power lines crossing tetraonid habitats was estimated using Geographical Information Systems and general knowledge about species-specific habitats. Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55% was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56% black grouse habitats and 16% willow ptarmigan habitats.        3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90%, 47% and 9% of the annual hunting harvest of these species.        4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.

AB  - Over the last decades, many wild goose populations have increased significantly and are now causing conflicts with socioeconomic and biological interests. To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pinkfooted geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trondelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.

AB  - We made monthly surveys of > 2000 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) from 1977 to 1987 before and after the construction of the Blue Lake hydroelectric reservoir in order to study the progressive impact of infrastructure development on wildlife. Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8% of pre-development densities without significant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217% increase in use of the few remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.

AB  - In this study, 236 regeneration areas (mostly clear-cuts) in southern Norway were selected by random stratified selection: 118 of the study units were cut before and 118 after the introduction of forest certification in 1998. The degree of compliance with biodiversity measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001 and the Norwegian standard "Living Forests'') was compared in a field study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21% of the postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41% had either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road transport, little improvement was seen. The discussion examines whether it is probable that the changes seen are a result of forest certification in Norway.

AB  - Retention forestry, including the retention of woodland key habitats (WKH) at the forest stand scale, has become an essential management practice in boreal forests. Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of 9470 habitat patches, mapped according to the Complementary Habitat Inventory method (CHI habitats), as potential WKHs in 10 sample areas in Norway. We ask whether there are parts of the forest landscapes that have consistently low or high density of CHI habitats compared to the surveyed landscape as a whole, and therefore have a low or high degree of conflict with harvesting, respectively. We found that there was a general pattern of clumped distribution of CHI habitats at distances up to a few kilometres. Furthermore, results showed that most types of CHI habitats were approximately two to three times as common in the 25% steepest slopes, lowest altitudes and highest site indices. CHI habitats that are most common in old-growth forests were found at longer distances from roads, whereas habitats rich in deciduous trees were found at shorter distances from roads than expected. Both environmental factors and the history of human impact are needed to explain the spatial distribution of CHI habitats. The overrepresentation of WKHs in parts of the forest landscapes represents a good starting point to develop more efficient inventory methods.

AB  - Shifting land use from agriculture to forestry induces major changes in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, including fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON). This study investigated the long-term effects of afforestation on ecosystem DOC and DON dynamics using a chronosequence approach comprising four arable fields and nine differently aged (10-92 years) Norway spruce stands growing on similar former arable soils in the same area. Along the chronosequence, concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON were determined in bulk precipitation, throughfall, O horizon leachate and mineral soil solution during a 2-3-year period. Soil water fluxes were calculated using a soil hydrological model (SWAP). Results showed that DOC concentrations and fluxes with throughfall were strongly positively correlated with tree height (r(2) = 0.95; P < 0.05 for both conc. and flux) and stand age, while DON showed no such trends, suggesting different origins of DOC and DON in throughfall. The highest concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON occurred in soil leachate from the 0 horizon. Here, DOC flux was 250-310 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and DON flux 8-9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in stands afforested between 65 and 92 years ago. Concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON in the mineral subsoil were consistently low. Flux calculations suggest that there was a net loss of >90% (230-280 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) of DOC leached from the 0 horizon within 0-60 cm of the mineral soil. There was no significant effect of land use or forest age on DOC concentrations in solution from the lower part of the A horizon. The effect of time since afforestation was masked by soil properties that influence DOM retention in the mineral soil. Our data indicate that DOC concentrations in the A horizon of the sites studied were primarily related to the oxalate-extractable Al and Fe amounts in the same horizon. Afforestation of arable land induced a gradual qualitative change in soil organic matter (SOM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), with significantly increasing C:N ratios in soil and soil solution over time. The development of an 0 horizon and the subsequent leaching of DOC and DON to the underlying mineral soil are important drivers of a changing soil C and N turnover following afforestation.

AB  - Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is a keystone species in boreal forests, but the few studies available concerning influence of forestry on bilberry growth, reproduction and chemical composition reveal conflicting results. We compared bilberry from mature stands and clear-cuts in a spruce forest landscape in south-central Norway, and applied the following experimental treatments: fertilisation, root cutting and flower removal to evaluate the effect of resource availability. During the second growing season we estimated bilberry shoot biomass as well as flowering and berry production, while bilberry shoots and leaves were collected in early summer and autumn for analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phenolic compound concentrations. The biomass of bilberry shoots was highest on clear-cuts and after fertilisation. All groups of phenolic compounds were also highest on clear-cuts, and phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in non-fertilised plots. Catechins and condensed tannins were highest in autumn, while phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in summer. Removal of flowers and root cutting had no effects. Nitrogen concentrations in shoots were highest in summer, after fertilisation, and when flowers were removed. The amount of flowers was highest in non-fertilised, mature forest sites, while the berry production was not significantly affected by any of the treatments or the site type. Our results indicate that in the studied area, the performance of bilberry is not negatively affected by clear-cutting, it rather seems that the environment on the clear-cuts give the plants abundant resources for enhancements both in growth, reproduction and defence compared with the mature forest sites. In the eyes of a herbivore, however, the quality of bilberry shoots as a feed-plant may be reduced on a clear-cut because of the higher phenolic concentration.

AB  - An increasing demand for bioenergy has stimulated interest in harvesting of tree stumps after felling operations. To reduce the amount of soil disturbance, it is recommended to retain stumps in wet areas. We wanted to evaluate if that strategy is beneficial also for saproxylic (wood-living) insects, which will have less habitat to breed in at stump harvest, and therefore also need mitigation. We tested if stumps in wet positions on a clear-cut harbour fewer species and a different assemblage of saproxylic insects than do stumps in dry positions. Insects were reared out from wood pieces taken from 100 stumps (50 Norway spruce, Picea abies and 50 birch, Betula spp.) sampled in pairs: one stump from wet and one from dry soil in each pair. In the lab 2201 individuals representing 49 beetle and 6 moth species were encountered. Fewer species were found in spruce stumps on wet soil than on dry soil, both when measured per stump or as an accumulated value over all stumps within the categories. No difference was detected between the number of species found in wet and dry birch stumps. However, three beetle species that live mainly in birch were more common in dry stumps than in wet. No species showed an association with wet stumps. We conclude that stumps in wet positions form an inferior habitat to stumps in dry positions, and that this should be considered when making recommendations concerning the harvesting of stumps for bioenergy.

AB  - The disturbance regime of boreal forests has been substantially altered by human influence in northern Europe. In this context, emulations of natural disturbance have become increasingly common as management tools to minimize negative effects of forestry on biodiversity. In a large-scale habitat-restoration experiment conducted in Norway spruce stands in southern Finland, we tested the effects of controlled burning, partial harvesting, and increasing the amount of downed wood on ground beetles (carabids). We also evaluated the effects of moisture gradients within harvested sites. We collected beetles seven years after the treatments. The moisture gradient was the strongest determinant of carabid assemblages and even after the most intense disturbances, the moist patches within sites still supported fauna characteristic of mire habitats. The species richness of carabids and the number of open-habitat associated species peaked on burned and harvested sites but we did not observe a typical pattern in beetle assemblages whereby numbers of rare species and species unique to post-disturbance habitats were elevated. Our findings suggest that (a) the influx of disturbance-associated species was apparently ephemeral and difficult to observe seven years post disturbance, and (b) moist patches within disturbed sites can serve as refugia for many closed-forest associated carabids over the early phases of post-disturbance succession.

AB  - The effects, in terms of economic value and harvest potential, of adopting restricted timber management practices promoting the preservation of biodiversity are analysed in a 5620 ha boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

AB  - The effects of landscape composition on species and populations have become increasingly important due to large and rapid habitat changes worldwide. In particular, concern is raised for several forest-dwelling species such as capercaillie and black grouse, because their habitats are continuously changing and deteriorating from human development. Conservation of these species is linked to sustainable forest management that seeks to benefit multiple species, which demands knowledge about demographic rates in relation to forest composition and structure. We related the spatial variation in adult density and chick production of capercaillie and black grouse to landscape characteristics from 13 areas within the boreal forest of Norway. Linear mixed effects models showed that black grouse and capercaillie had similar associations to landscape characteristics. Adult density of both species was positively related to the proportion of old forest (> 80 years), but only if the area had large proportions of mid to high productive forests. Chick production was negatively related to the proportion of old forest, but positively to habitat diversity and more so for black grouse compared to capercaillie. However, the result for chick production suggest that other forest types also are important, and that forest grouse needs a variety of habitats during their life history stages. Management that seeks to simultaneously conserve populations of black grouse and capercaillie needs to ensure a matrix of various forest types. A special focus must be on the critical life history of local populations to successfully preserve viable populations, for black grouse and capercaillie this implies protection of old and mid to high productive forest while keeping a heterogeneous landscape.

AB  - Rapid, but contrasting, changes in the extent of erect thicket-forming shrubs is presently seen in the Arctic, either resulting from a warmer climate (increasing extent) or intensified herbivory (decreasing extent). We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra.

AB  - Domestic herbivores often compete with wildlife for limited resources, and on longer time-scales, grazing may also increase or decrease coverage of important food plants to wildlife affecting the threshold density for when competition can be expected. In Norway, there are growing concerns about the effect of releasing 2.1 million domestic sheep (Ovis aries) for summer grazing into areas hosting wild populations of alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We quantified the effect of sheep grazing (0, 25 and 80 sheep/km(2)) on the development in coverage and abundance of plants known to be important in the diet of reindeer during summer (vascular plants) and winter (lichens) within a fully replicated, landscape scale (2.7 km(2)) experiment. From 2001 to 2005, the sedge, Carex bigelowii, increased while the herb Solidago virgaurea decreased in frequency at high density of sheep relative to controls (both marginally non-significant). There was no marked development in Deschampsia flexuosa, Salix herbacea or Hierarcium alpinum that could be related to sheep grazing intensity. Lichen coverage and height both decreased at high density of sheep from 2002 to 2005. Effects of low grazing intensity were closer to controls than to high grazing intensity. Our study highlights that high sheep grazing intensity induce changes to the plant community that, at the same time, can improve the summer habitat and detriment the winter habitat to reindeer. Many wild reindeer populations are fragmented and may thus be limited by either summer or winter range. The effect of sheep grazing is predicted to vary accordingly. However, currently, we have limited ability to quantify how much this explicitly means in terms of increased or reduced carrying capacity for reindeer.

AB  - This paper presents long-range forest management analyses with the objective of mapping consequences for the timber production potential when forest management treatments are changed in an environmentally oriented direction. Sample plots from the National Forest Inventory, covering the entire productive forest area in Norway, were aggregated into 10000 treatment units. Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas. With a real rate of discount of 2.5%, and all the constraints imposed simultaneously, the annual harvest potential was reduced by 30% for the first 10-year period, while the net present value was reduced by 21.5%. The results further demonstrated significant efficiency gains of letting the preservation of old forest be allocated cost-efficiently, compared with a strategy of setting aside an equal portion oil all eligible areas.

AB  - Harvesting can have a substantial impact on population dynamics and individual performance in wild populations. While the direct consequences of harvest on individual survival and population growth rate are often apparent, harvesting can also have indirect and more subtle demographic consequences. Disentangling these consequences, however, requires in-depth knowledge of individual life histories of both females and males in the population. Here, we summarise demographic research on a population where such data exist: the Vega moose population in northern Norway. In this population, vital rates vary considerably among both females and males, and harvesting increases this variation by generating positive covariation between reproductive performance and survival. The skewed age and sex structure, which is typical of many harvested populations, also has demographic consequences: it reduces the ratio of effective to total population size and influences variation in vital rates in males and females. The moose harvest at Vega is structured by age- and sex-specific quotas, but it is not intentionally selective regarding size or other phenotypic characteristics. Still, harvest selection for earlier birth rates and larger calves was apparent, likely due to habitat-performance relationships and habitat-specific harvest mortality. Together, the bulk of research on this population shows that harvesting impacts population demography through many different pathways, with some being more subtle than others. These complex pathways influence the demographic variance and affect stochastic processes such as population growth, genetic drift, and rates of evolutionary change, and they must therefore be acknowledged in management plans to achieve sustainable harvesting.

AB  - Abstract        In the study outlined, visitor-employed photography (VEP) has been used to investigate how tourists and locals evaluate the built rural landscape in five Norwegian winter destinations in the summer time. Norwegian and international tourists and some locals were equipped with single-use cameras, a log and a questionnaire with the instruction to take pictures of attractive and non-attractive elements in the constructed landscape. Despite the intention of the study to emphasize the built landscape, the selection of motives shows that tourists - especially the international ones - are more strongly occupied with the natural landscape and its attractive elements than, for instance, the outlook of buildings. The respondents value destination development where the natural, cultural and built landscape form a unity which reflect the perceived images of traditional rural environments and everyday life. On the other hand, Norwegians - and locals particularly - are more conscious about local building traditions, especially the non-attractive elements in that respect. Our findings demonstrate that VEP and public participation are useful tools in destination development and branding, and that a holistic design and approach might create competitive advantages for rural destinations trying to position themselves in the overall market place.

AB  - A population of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in south-central Sweden showed a strong preference for forest older than 35 years and with more than 25% Norway spruce (Picea abies). This preferred habitat constituted 24% of the study area. The proportion of avoided habitats was 30%, and the remaining 46% could be described as used but not preferred habitats. Given these proportions, the squirrels can be shown theoretically to be able to reach all preferred patches by moving across the used, although not preferred habitat patches, or within the preferred ones. Males had larger home ranges (mean 121.6 ha) than females (mean 23.0 ha). Mean daily movement was 430 m for males and 180 m for females; the maximum movement was 2800 m for males and 680 m for females. Most of the preferred habitat occurred in fragments larger than the area requirement of an individual squirrel, and even the most isolated fragments were within a trivial range for squirrels. Therefore, we predict that the random sample hypothesis will give a good prediction of the effects of forest fragmentation on the red squirrel in this landscape. However, if the proportion of avoided habitats increases, isolation and fragment size might affect the population density of red squirrels and the population size would be smaller than predicted from the random sample hypothesis.

AB  - Wildlife damage to human property threatens human-wildlife coexistence. Conflicts arising from wildlife damage in intensively managed landscapes often undermine conservation efforts, making damage mitigation and compensation of special concern for wildlife conservation. However, the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of damage and claims at large scales are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the patterns of damage caused by brown bears Ursus arctos and its ecological and socio-economic correlates at a continental scale. We compiled information about compensation schemes across 26 countries in Europe in 2005-2012 and analysed the variation in the number of compensated claims in relation to (i) bear abundance, (ii) forest availability, (iii) human land use, (iv) management practices and (v) indicators of economic wealth. Most European countries have a posteriori compensation schemes based on damage verification, which, in many cases, have operated for more than 30years. On average, over 3200 claims of bear damage were compensated annually in Europe. The majority of claims were for damage to livestock (59%), distributed throughout the bear range, followed by damage to apiaries (21%) and agriculture (17%), mainly in Mediterranean and eastern European countries. The mean number of compensated claims per bear and year ranged from 01 in Estonia to 85 in Norway. This variation was not only due to the differences in compensation schemes; damage claims were less numerous in areas with supplementary feeding and with a high proportion of agricultural land. However, observed variation in compensated damage was not related to bear abundance.Synthesis and applications. Compensation schemes, management practices and human land use influence the number of claims for brown bear damage, while bear abundance does not. Policies that ignore this complexity and focus on a single factor, such as bear population size, may not be effective in reducing claims. To be effective, policies should be based on integrative schemes that prioritize damage prevention and make it a condition of payment of compensation that preventive measures are applied. Such integrative schemes should focus mitigation efforts in areas or populations where damage claims are more likely to occur. Similar studies using different species and continents might further improve our understanding of conflicts arising from wildlife damage.

AB  - Plant species composition and species number were studied in two types of field margins: 31 arable field margins and 33 road verges. Both field margin types were adjacent to intensively managed grass or cereal fields. Effects of eight variables on field margin vegetation were studied. Despite having many plant species in common, composition and species number differed between the two field margin types, due to different ecological conditions and margin management. Arable field margins were composed of tall and/or nutrient demanding ubiquitous species and were characterised by species of later successional stages than those of road verges. The vegetation of road verges was lower and species numbers were higher than in arable field margins. The road verges contained several semi-natural meadow species that are declining in abundance. A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded variables showed that plant species composition was significantly affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent to fields with mainly cereal crops. In order to preserve botanical diversity in this agricultural landscape, the maintenance of regularly mown road verges should be prioritized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Logging exceeded growth and timber trees were sparse in Norwegian forests in the early 1900s. Still, the forest canopy was lush green and characterised by large tree-crowns. This situation was referred to as the "Green lie'' and was advocated by foresters throughout Scandinavia as an argument in favour of forestry practices based on clear-felling. Here we examine effects of past selective loggings on forest structure and composition in a spruce forest landscape using dendroecology and historical records. Our results show that forests that were selectively logged up to the early 1900s could be structurally heterogeneous with multi-layered canopies, varying degree of openness and continuous presence of old trees across different spatial scales. Because the past forests were not clear-felled, a diverse forest structure in terms of tree species composition and age and diameter distribution was maintained over time, which could enable forest-dwelling species to persist during the early phase following the loggings in the past. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in most modern managed forest landscapes in Scandinavia. A better understanding of the link between loggings in the past- and present-day forest structure and diversity will contribute to rewarding discussions on forestry methods for the future.

AB  - 1. Litter sex ratio variation in enclosed populations of two strains of root voles originating from northern and southern Norway was studied in experimentally fragmented habitats during 2. years (1990 and 1991) in the period early July-mid October.        2. Three fragmentation patterns differing with respect to habitat fragment size and interfragment connectivity (corridors) were colonized by voles from either strain in each of the 9 years; yielding two population replicates per strain and fragmentation pattern. Litter affiliation of weanlings was decided from a combination of trapping data, marking of lactating mothers with fluorescent powder and marking of nestlings.        3. Habitat fragmentation had no consistent influence on weanling sex ratio at the population level. However, within populations of both strains, mothers inhabiting a habitat fragment alone produced more female-biased litters than those sharing a fragment with other reproductive females.        4. For the south Norwegian strain, large mothers produced more female-biased litters than small mothers. The southern strain had an overall female-biased weanling sex ratio the first year, probably because reproductive females were generally heavier in 1990 than in 1991.        5. The results are consistent with hypotheses predicting that females should adjust the litter sex ratio according to resource availability and social environment at a local scale, as well as to their own competitive ability. It is argued that adaptive sex ratio variation in Microtus is more probably due to spatial variability of fitness returns from daughters than from sons, because females are the philopatric sex and compete at a smaller spatial scale than males.

AB  - Landa, A. & Skogland, T.dagger 1995: The relationship between population density and body size of wolverines Gulo gulo in Scandinavia. - Wildl. Biol. 1: 165-175. The number of wolverines Gulo gulo in Scandinavia has declined dramatically since the middle of the last century, and the numbers killed continued to decrease until the species was protected. In 1968 the species was protected in Sweden; in 1973 the wolverine was given full protection in southern Norway and protection during the breeding period in northern Norway; and in 1982 the species was also given full protection in northern Norway. The protection has resulted in some increase in number, but the population density remains much lower than at the turn of the century, and the wolverine has yet not reoccupied all of its former range. Our analyses show that body size, as reflected by skull characters, was inversely correlated with population density from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-to late twentieth century. In contrast we found a strong decline in body size in the decades after ca 1960. The unexpectedly low wolverine resilience in this century may be explained by an energy-restricted model whose main factors include: 1) habitat fragmentation, 2) loss of habitat, 3) extinction of the dominant predator, the wolf Canis lupus, and 4) a maximised turnover in managed ungulate populations that has resulted in less natural mortality and fewer weakened animals available for scavengers and less efficient predators like the wolverine.

AB  - Since the mid-1990s, it has been common practice to leave trees for biodiversity purposes when clear-cutting in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and regulations for such tree retention are today included in national legislation and certification standards. Peer-reviewed research publications on tree retention from studies performed in the three countries were analyzed and about 50 relevant biodiversity studies were found, with the first published in 1994. Most studies were directed towards beetles and dead wood, especially high stumps. General conclusions were that retention trees (1) provide some of the substrate types required by early-successional species, (2) alleviate the most serious consequences of clear-cutting on biota, and (3) cannot maintain characteristics of intact mature forests. Larger volumes and more trees tend to maintain diversity better. There is a particular lack of studies on dispersal, landscape effects and long-term dynamics. There is a need to study further the relationship between the biota and the amount of trees, as well as their spatial arrangement. Retention trees should preferably be evaluated in relation to other components in multiscaled conservation, including woodland key habitats and larger protected areas.

AB  - Logging history and the study of reference conditions in Scandinavian boreal forests has tended to focus on Scots pine dominated ecosystems. This paper presents a regional study of pre-industrial forest conditions and examines the effects of the industrial exploitation of ecosystems dominated by Not-way spruce in northern Sweden. Historical records covering a period which preceded industrial logging in the study area (1917-1927) were used to obtain quantitative data on forest structure and influence of forest fires. These data were compared with a modern data set (2003) to analyse changes due to the industrial transformation of the forest. The early 20th century landscape was dominated by old, multi-cohorted spruce forests and mixed coniferous forests. It was found that fire affected both the structure and composition of the landscape. In post-burnt areas, even-aged forests dominated by deciduous species were the principal forest type. Between the early and modern data sets, profound changes in tree-species composition and age structure were documented. While the total volume of deciduous species increased substantially, the coverage of forests dominated by deciduous species decreased. There was also a significant increase in pine-dominated forests and in the total volume of pine. The industrial transformation of the studied landscapes has had profound effects oil the structure of spruce forests, but much less so oil deciduous forests. The study concludes that the present forest structure is a function of past management regimes, and that future transformations of the landscape will continue, thus affecting the natural variability and biodiversity of the forests.

AB  - The study describes an integrated impact assessment tool for the net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in forest production. The components of the net carbon exchange include the uptake of carbon into biomass, the decomposition of litter and humus, emissions from forest management operations and carbon released from the combustion of biomass and degradation of wood-based products. The tool enables the allocation of the total carbon emissions to the timber and energy biomass and to the energy produced on the basis of biomass. In example computations, ecosystem model simulations were utilized as an input to the tool. We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland. In our examples, the emissions allocated for the energy from biomass in southern Finland were 172 and 188 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in the current climate and in a CC, respectively, and 199 and 157 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in northern Finland. This study concludes that the tool is suitable for estimating the net carbon exchange of forest production. The tool also enables the allocation of direct and indirect carbon emissions, related to forest production over its life cycle, in different environmental conditions and for alternative time periods and land uses. Simulations of forest management regimes together with the CC give new insights into ecologically sustainable forest bioenergy and timber production, as well as climate change mitigation options in boreal forests.

AB  - For huntable waterbird species, the autumn migration strategy may be important for their fitness, as their behaviour and environmental factors may influence their exposure to hunting mortality. Hunting activity may also reduce the access to food resources which may be limited in the wintering areas, thereby affecting winter survival. In this study we assessed the possible influence of food resources, weather conditions, inter-specific competition and hunting intensity (as a measure of possible disturbance) on abundance and distribution of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus at their main autumn stopover site in Norway. The results show that food resources in term of spilt cereal grain were abundant, even by the time the geese had moved on. Snow cover did not limit the food availability during the main migratory period. Inter-specific competition with greylag geese Anser anser reduced food supplies locally and appeared to be increasing. Goose hunting intensity varied among sites and our data indicate a negative relationship between hunting intensity and the rate at which geese consumed the food resources. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of pink-footed geese leave the stopover area earlier than they would otherwise, when hunting intensities are high. In the case of pink-footed geese, population consequences of disturbance is not a concern at present; however, an international species management plan calls for 1) keeping disturbance low in areas where geese do not cause conflicts with agriculture to prevent them being pushed to areas with problems, and 2) increased harvest to reduce and stabilise the population size. Both objectives can be met by reducing hunting disturbance in mid-Norway and it is recommended that a better local organisation of hunting is implemented.

AB  - The increasing development of recreational resorts and second homes in mountain regions worldwide require substantial infrastructure, and have large impact on habitats and ecosystems. We hypothesized that developed areas would attract predators and lead to higher predation on willow ptarmigan and lower their abundance. In a 500-km(2) study area in south-central Norway, we sampled the density of territorial cocks in spring and the breeding success of willow ptarmigan along a 3-km gradient extending out from clusters of cabins. We also sampled red fox scats and corvid birds and measured nest predation on artificial nests across this gradient. Densities of cocks in the spring and of adults and brood sizes in August did not vary along the gradient. However, the density of chicks in August was higher beyond 1.5 km from cabin areas, presumably because more hens lost their clutches in the vicinity of cabins. This was supported by the results from the artificial nest experiment where significantly more nests were depredated near cabin areas than further away. The number of scats of red fox along trails increased with distance from cabins, whereas more corvid birds were observed near cabins. We conclude that corvid birds were the main cause of higher loss of ptarmigan nests near cabin areas, which led to lower production of chicks. Breeding density, however, did not seem to vary along the gradient, presumably because of suitable habitat for breeding and little human activity in these areas during the period of pair formation and nesting.

AB  - Earlier land use in European mountains included grazing by different kinds of livestock, while today it may be more homogenous, and the grazing may have either been intensified or been abandoned. Different domestic animal species graze in different areas of the landscape. Therefore, grazing stocks composed of different species have an unequal effect on the landscape. This study compares the influence of four domestic animal species (cattle, sheep, goats, reindeer) on landscape dynamics in Jotunheimen, a Norwegian mountain range. Interviews and maps showing grazing land of domestic animals were performed to collect information about land use in the summer farm surroundings. Grazing pressure maps (prior to 1960 and 1960-2002) using the land use information obtained, and vegetation maps (from the 1960s and 2002) using aerial photographs, were digitized. Vegetation was spatially linked with grazing pressure using GIS and multiple multinomial and linear regressions were used to investigate each species' effect on vegetation type change and displacement of the forest line, respectively. The results show that cattle grazing influenced transitions from grasslands, cattle together with goats affected transitions from heaths, and cattle, goats, and reindeer influenced displacement of the birch forest line. High grazing pressure from these three domestic animals suppressed forest and scrub establishment in open habitats. Only goats, however, caused transitions from scrub and birch forest to open vegetation types. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The removal of logging residues and stumps from clear-cuts has become a common forestry practice. Forest fuel harvesting decreases the initially low volume of dead wood in managed forests, but the biodiversity effects are poorly known. We studied the effects of forest fuel harvesting on decomposer fungi on clear-cut Norway spruce stands in central Finland. The number of occurrences and taxa of polypores, saprotrophic agarics and pleurotoid agarics were determined on 10 forest fuel harvested and 10 control clear-cuts 4-5 years after logging. In total, we recorded 148 fungal taxa. The total number of taxa, the number of polypore occurrences, and the number of polypore species within small area were lower at forest fuel harvested sites. The effect on the number of saprotrophic agaric taxa became obvious with increasing area. Most of the common polypore species had fewer occurrences on forest fuel harvested sites while the commonest agaric species increased due to forest fuel harvesting. Concerning different dead wood types, there were fewer fungal species and occurrences on stumps and fewer occurrences on logs on forest fuel harvested sites. Most of the effects of forest fuel harvesting were explained by the reduction in resource availability. We conclude that forest fuel harvesting, especially stump removal, has negative effects on decomposer fungi and that there is a risk that populations of certain species still thriving in managed forests will decline in the future.

AB  - Current forestry policies worldwide aim at conserving and restoring biodiversity in managed forests. In this respect, epiphytic lichens have become a focal group in studies of how logging and silvicultural methods can be adjusted to mimic and restore old-growth conditions. We addressed this issue in a retrospective study in the coastal spruce (Picea abies) forest region of central Norway, surveying 31 old forest sites in order to relate a selected group of epiphytic macrolichens (Fuscopannaria ahlneri, Lobaria pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, Nephroma spp., Platismatia norvegica, Pseudocyphellaria crocata, Ramalina thrausta, and Sphaerophorus globosus) to forest stand characteristics and previous logging history. The lichens were associated with brook ravines, F. ahlneri and P. crocata mostly so, being 10 times more abundant in ravine valley bottoms than on adjacent slopes and plateaus. All species used spruce trees as their main substrate, but L. pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, and Nephroma spp. preferred scattered deciduous trees. Ramalina thrausta and S. globosus occurred more frequently on older trees and increased in number with increasing stand age. In ravine valley bottoms lichens tended to increase in number with increasing tree density (due to increased amount of branches), whereas the opposite was the case on slopes and plateaus (due to higher proportion of high-branched trees). All locations had been selectively cut two or more times during the last 100 yr, with a total harvested volume of 31-124% of present-day standing volumes. After controlling for covariation with stand structure, variables describing logging history (harvested volume, number of cuts, minimum standing volume, and years since last cut) did not explain significant parts of the variation in present-day abundance of the selected lichens. The results suggest that moderate selective cuttings may prove an acceptable management option to sustain viable lichen assemblages on private land.

AB  - In a 136 km(2) coniferous area in southeastern Norway, 13 of 24 past leks, known from the 1930-40S, went extinct and 5 new leks were established, by 1985. There was no difference in extinction rate between clearfelled (7 of 13) and untreated (6 of 11) leks. Number of leks, number of cocks per lek, and total number of cocks were reduced by 33, 53, and 69%, respectively, compared with a 69% reduction in suitable habitat (forest. older than 70 years). We argue that the overall population decline merely was due to a general fragmentation of suitable habitats, rather than direct clearfelling of lek areas.

AB  - The loss of natural forest habitats due to forestry is the main reason for the decline in boreal forest biodiversity of the Nordic countries of Europe. Ecological rehabilitation may provide means to recover and sustain biodiversity. We analyzed the effects of controlled burning and dead-wood creation (DWC) on the diversity of pioneer wood-inhabiting fungi in managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southern Finland. Altogether 18 stands were first subjected to a partial cutting with ordinary logging residues in form of cut stumps and treetops left on site. The subsequent rehabilitation treatments consisted of a controlled burning applied in half of the stands and three levels of dead-wood creation (5, 30 and 60 m(3) ha(-1)). The DWC involved creation of logs; felling of whole trees to mimic downed logs formed by natural disturbance processes. Each treatment was replicated three times. Inside each stand, substrates were sampled in two different biotopes; one on mineral soil and one on mineral soil with a thin peat layer. We surveyed the fungal flora on the logs (n = 364) and the ordinary residue stumps (n = 1767) and tops (n = 845) five years after the treatments.        When comparing different stands, controlled burning had a significant effect on species composition; certain species were significantly more frequent on substrates in burned stands than in unburned stands, indicating that these species were favored by controlled burning. By contrast, we found no significant effects of DWC levels or biotope on species composition or richness. When comparing different substrates, 99% of the logs hosted at least one species and the occurrence probability of certain species was significantly higher on logs than on ordinary residue stumps and tops. Yet, volume-based rarefaction analyses showed that residues were more species dense than the logs, indicating that ordinary logging residues constitute important resources for many pioneer species.        We conclude that controlled burning combined with DWC have strong effects on biodiversity; it modifies the composition of the pioneer wood-inhabiting fungal species found in managed forests and may thereby also influence the further succession and diversity of the secondary fungal flora.

AB  - The active creation of coarse woody debris (CWD) has been suggested as a measure to preserve and restore biodiversity in managed forests. A common practice in Sweden is to create high stumps at final cutting. We evaluated the importance of high stumps for saproxylic (wood-dependent) beetles in a boreal forest landscape in central Sweden. The number of high stumps created on clearcuts was recorded and the beetle fauna under the bark of high stumps of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was sampled. High stumps yielded only 0.13% of CWD volume and bark area in the landscape. Out of the 29 beetle species most frequently found in the landscape, high stumps were the major source of recruitment at the landscape level for only one, Hadreule elongatula (Gyllenhal). For the remaining 28 beetle species, less than 1% of the landscape's population occurred in high stumps on clearcuts. The abundance of H. elongatula increased with the area of the surrounding forest land that was covered by clearcuts within a radius of 1000 m. This is the first example of a saproxylic species associated with clearcuts, in contemporary forest landscapes, for which such an occurrence pattern has been documented.

AB  - To maintain biodiversity in managed forests we must understand the patterns and processes that regulate the occurrence and dynamics of species in undisturbed ecosystems. We compared biomass and species composition of canopy lichens on 180 lower branches of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three pairs of old-growth and managed (selectively logged) stands in northern Sweden (30 branches per stand). The purpose was to evaluate the effect of substrate quality (branch characteristics) on patterns of lichen biomass for two different growth forms (foliose and fruticose).        Old-growth stands had six times higher lichen mass per spruce branch, and two times higher expressed as percentage of branch mass, compared to mature stands of managed forest. Lichen mass was strongly related to mass, diameter, and age of branches. Fruticose, pendulous species (Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp.) were highly sensitive to forest practices. In contrast, type of forest had no significant effect on foliose species. Species number per stand was the same (15 species) in both types of forest, but there were marked differences in the relative abundance of different lichen groups. Results suggest that limited amount of substrate (i.e., small branches) available to lichens, and young branches, providing only a short time for lichen colonization and growth, are important factors limiting epiphytic lichen abundance in managed forests. Conversion of old-growth forest into young, managed stands will lead to a significant reduction in epiphytic lichen mass. This in turn may probably affect nutrient cycling in forests and has negative consequences for animals that utilize canopy lichens as food, shelter, or nesting material.

AB  - During the past decades, goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations have declined in torest-dominated landscapes in Norway. To reveal the importance of different prey species in forest versus farmland landscapes, we video recorded 146 prey deliveries at four nests in a farmland-dominated area and three nests in a forest-dominated area in south-eastern Norway in June 2005. Thrushes and corvids were the dominating prey in both areas. We found higher diet diversity in the forest-dominated landscape, but we also found high dietary overlap, presumably due to the dominance of thrushes in both areas. Prey composition of forest versus farmland species differed significantly between the areas, mainly due to a higher proportion of corvids and a lower proportion of grouse in the farmland-dominated area. Goshawk diet thus reflects the habitats within the nesting territory.

AB  - Altogether 335 species of saproxylic beetles were collected by Malaise, window and emergence traps in a 33 ha forest reserve in southern Norway, during the years 1992-1997. Most species are associated with deciduous trees, particularly oak, and the majority depend on decayed wood or fungi. The forest is a mixture of Norway spruce and deciduous trees and is characterized as being very close to a primeval forest. Sixty-two species of the collected beetles are assumed to be threatened or rare in Scandinavia, 52 species are on the Red Data List in Sweden and 43 species are suggested for a similar list in Norway. Fifteen species are on a list of species threatened in the Nordic region. Compared with other thoroughly sampled forest reserves in Fennoscandia, the forest investigated had one of the richest saproxylic beetle communities known to date. The main reasons for this are assumed to be the abundance of dead wood, the diverse tree composition and the fact that the area had been inaccessible for forest harvesting due to the lack of transportation for timber.

AB  - Soil is an important component for monitoring of sustainability of land use in relation to both the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity of ecosystems. Recently research has focused on the role of mites (Acari) in biomonitoring and their importance as soil bioindicators. Mite communities are extremely sensitive to all types of soil disturbance. This article presents a review of some studies on mite communities in order to discuss whether the diversity and numbers of mites present in the soil can reflect human impact on ecosystems and landscape, and whether mites can be used in monitoring systems. Limited data available about mite communities in agricultural ecosystems (in use and abandoned) in SW Norway from author's own studies (published and in prep.) are compared with data from ca. 55 papers (mostly concerning Europe). IT was concluded that: (1) Most oribatid mites with their long life span, low fecundity, slow development and low dispersion ability can be a robust indicator of the environment. Changes in the dominance structure of mite communities (Oribatida to Actinedida ratio) are suggested to be an 'early warnings criterion for stressed mite communities. (2) Both the number of species and the percentage abundance of Nothroidea and Ptyctimina decrease following human impact on the landscape. Even if individuals cannot be determined to species levels (e.g. Ptyctimina), the percent contribution and frequency of these taxa in relation to stress gradient (input levels) within the landscape provide valuable data. (3) Tectocepheus velatus (Michael 1880) and other oribatid taxa with a similar life-history strategy should be evaluated as potential bioindicators for impoverished ecosystems. (4) National and local reference data sets on the biodiversity of mite communities in diverse habitats and along stress gradients need to be collected. (5) Residual natural and semi-natural habitats (such as old woodlands, riparian ecosystems, old hedges and grasslands) with species-rich mite communities found in rural and urban landscapes should be preserved as refuges for dispersion of soil fauna. (6) Comparison of mite communities in traditional, low-input farmland in Norway with those from human-dominated landscape in other European countries can contribute to a better understanding of how human activity alters biodiversity along land-use gradients. This will aid the development of a soil bioindicator system. (7) There is a need to develop standardised procedures for the collection of samples and analyses of data sets adapted to ecological soil acarology.

AB  - The areal extent and configuration of thickets of willow shrubs are currently changing in the Arctic both as an effect of global warming and changed browsing pressure of reindeer. These changes have been predicted to impact the distribution and abundance of wildlife species relying on willow thickets as habitat. We assessed the relation between variables quantifying willow thicket configuration and population dynamics of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in three riparian regions in Finnmark, northern Norway, which were subject to intense browsing by semi-domesticated reindeer. The tundra vole, which exhibits 5-year population cycles in Finnmark, is the dominant small rodent species in riparian landscape elements in southern arctic tundra. In the course of a 4-year trapping study, tundra vole populations went through the cyclic phases of increase, peak and crash, however, with distinct differences between the three regions in the population dynamics. Within regions, the occupancy pattern during the increase phase was positively related to willow thicket configuration (in particular edge density and willow height) only in the region attaining the highest abundance and occupancy. However, local abundance was not clearly related to habitat features within any regions. The lack of consistency in the response of tundra vole populations to willow thicket configuration, as well as the positive relation between the degree of thicket shredding and tundra vole habitat occupancy in one of the regions, indicates that tundra voles will not be much affected by climate or browsing induced changes in the shrubbiness of the tundra in the future.

AB  - Restoration by imitating natural disturbances is widely practised in boreal forests to increase the availability of habitats for specialized species. We studied the abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles on different types of created dead wood during 2 years after restoration. The study was conducted on areas of a large-scale experiment in which Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests were restored by controlled burning and partial harvesting with down wood retention in southern Finland. More beetle species were attracted to spruces than to birches and more species were attracted to burnt trees than to unburnt trees killed by girdling. Birch-living species consistently benefited from fire, but on spruce, the abundance of cambium consumers and their associates was negatively affected by fire. Trees at harvested sites attracted more beetles in the first year, but the volume of down wood retention had only minor effects. Beetle assemblages were strongly altered by burning and harvesting. We conclude that burning and harvesting are efficient tools to promote species richness within a short time period, but there is a risk that the dead wood resource may be rapidly exhausted. Moreover, many saproxylic species of spruce forests may not be adapted to open habitats formed by stand-replacing disturbances.

AB  - Forest fuel harvesting increases the need to collect not just logging residues but also tree stumps from harvested stands. This biomass removal has raised concern over forest biodiversity. Here, the effects of stump harvesting on spiders, ants, harvestmen, ground beetles and epiedaphic springtails occupying boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest floor were studied two and five years after harvesting by comparing pitfall trap samples from clear-cut sites with and without subsequent stump harvesting and from unharvested mature forests in central Finland. At harvested sites, traps were placed both on intact and exposed mineral soil surface. Open-habitat and generalist ground beetles benefitted from the stump harvesting, but generally the numbers of arthropods between stump harvesting treatments and different aged clear-cuts were rather similar. The intact forest floor hosted more ants, springtails and harvestmen than did the exposed mineral soil. Moreover, the community structure of spiders, ground beetles and spring tails was affected by stump harvesting, forest-floor quality (intact or exposed), and time elapsed since harvesting. Based on these results we recommend minimizing the exposure of mineral soil during management practices. However, more long-term studies are required to document the development of fauna in the harvested areas and the ecosystem-level impacts of utilization of forest biomass for energy.

AB  - There is growing evidence that biodiversity is important for ecosystem functions. Thus, identification of habitat requirements essential for current species richness and abundance to persist is crucial. Hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are biodiversity hot spots for deadwood-dependent insect species, and the main objective of this paper was to test the effect of habitat history and current habitat distribution at various spatial scales on the associated beetle community. We used a gradient spanning 40 km from the coast to inland areas reflecting historical logging intensity (later and lower intensities inland) through 500 years in Southern Norway, to investigate whether the historical variation in oak density is influencing the structure of beetle communities in hollow oaks today. We trapped beetles in 32 hollow oaks along this gradient in forested and seminatural landscapes over two summers. We found higher species richness and total abundance inland consistent with our expectation based on historic logging intensity. Scale-specific environmental variables also affected the response; beetle abundances were controlled by local conditions, whereas beetle species richness responded to habitat on the landscape scale. This indicates that long time continuity as well as large areas of favorable habitat is necessary to maintain beetle species richness through time in these highly long-lasting structures.

AB  - We investigated possible avoidance behavior of calving semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) near recreational cabins, roads, and power transmission lines in Repparfjord Valley, northern Norway. The distribution, sex, and general age composition of the reindeer were mapped during the 1998 and 1999 calving seasons (n=776 and n=678, respectively) using systematic snowmobile and ski surveys. Mean reindeer density within preferred habitat was 78% lower in the area <4 km from the tourist resort compared to the area >4 km from the resort (1.47 vs. 6.68 reindeer/km(2), respectively). Mean reindeer density by the power line corridor without traffic was 73% lower in the area <4 kin from the power line compared to areas >4 km from the power line for comparable habitat. Areas <4 kin from anthropogenic structures were avoided despite low levels of human traffic and a high proportion of preferred habitat. Within snow-free sites available for grazing, no significant differences occurred in phenological development of cotton-grass (Eriophorum spp.), in live:dead ratio of plant material, or in graminoid biomass with distance to the tourist resort. Almost 74% of all available forage was located within the avoided 0-4-km zones front the resort or the separate power line. Our results suggest that power lines, even without human traffic, may result in substantial reductions in the use of foraging areas. The combined actions of power lines, roads, and cabins may increase potential avoidance, thereby increasing the use of remaining undisturbed grazing grounds. Possible increased competition for high-quality forage may affect lactation, body condition, and, hence. reproductive success in the long term.

AB  - We have studied the variation in average performance of Vaccinium myrtillus L. among local populations within an intensively managed boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. Our aim was to identify whether forest disturbance history was an important factor controlling the variation in average plant performance. We used three measures of forest maturity (maturity class, tree biomass and number of trees) as variables reflecting disturbance history. These variables were used in our analysis together with measured environmental conditions (soil moisture, pH, nitrogen, and elevation) a priori known to affect plant performance. To quantify plant performance, we used multiple measures of the local V. myrtillus populations, including percentage cover, average ramet age, height, diameter, biomass, growth, and sexual reproduction (number of fruits and number of mature seeds per fruit). Most of the explained variation in our performance variables could be related to our environmental variables, but disturbance history was also an important determinant of the performance of V. myrtillus. All performance variables were higher in younger, less mature stands, except ramet age, which was highest in mature stands. The increase in performance after clear cutting indicates that this period is of high importance for the population dynamics and persistence of V. myrtillus in intensively managed boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - Acari and Collembola are the dominant groups within the mycophagous arthropods linked to fungal-based food webs in undisturbed soils. Studies on soil microarthropod communities in old, traditional, multifunctional farmland, and studies on secondary succession following marginalization and abandonment of traditional farmland are lacking in Europe. Thus, we studied patterns of microarthropod communities related to different land use regimes in a traditional farm in Western Norway. Soil mesofauna communities were analysed at four sites: site OM - old, herb rich, open hay meadow in traditional use; site F1 - abandoned hay meadow with pollarded trees (first fallow); site F2 - deciduous woodland (abandoned hay meadow with old pollards, heavily overgrown, second fallow); and site RM - restored hay meadow with scattered, newly pollarded trees. The abundance of the taxa varied considerably between habitats (for instance: total microarthropods - from 112.4 +/- 11.4 to 29.2 +/- 3.4, Acari - from 83.9 +/- 10.2 to 15.6 +/- 1.8 and Oribatida - from 68.6 +/- 9.5 to 8.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(3) m(-2), for OM and RM sites respectively).        The abundance of total Acari, total Oribatida, Oribatida adults and juveniles differed significantly between OM-F1, OM-RM, OM-F2 and RM-F2 sites and it was significantly correlated with continuity of land use and/or tree cover. Oribatida was the group with the highest densities and percentage dominance (except RM site). The percent contribution of total Oribatida in Acari abundance was negatively correlated with the percentage of Actinedida. Nine Ptyctimina species, six Nothroidea species and four Uropodina species were detected, but most of them occurred as single individuals. Abundance of three Ptyctimina [Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus (C.L. Koch), Phthiracarus ferrugineus (C.L. Koch), P globosus (C.L. Koch)], and two Uropodina [Trachytes pauperior Berlese and Dinychus perforatus Kramer] species differed significantly between some sites. The percentage similarity (Renkonen index) has a high indicative value for measuring the distance between ecosystems with apparently similar communities of Uropodina.        The OM and RM sites differed most and site pairs - F1-F2 and F1-RM were the most similar. The densities of some taxa were about two-or three-fold greater for the F1site than the RM site. Ratios of Acari to Collembola, total Oribatida to Collembola and total Oribatida to Actinedida were highest on OM site (3.2, 2.6, 11.8 respectively) and decreased in the following order: F2>F1>RM (as an example, total Oribatida to Actinedida ratios were 9.8 on F2 site, 6.2 on F1 and 3.1. on RM). These ratios differed significantly between the OM and RM sites. The lowest ratios on RM site are probably an effect of recent disturbance (change of land use) of this site. Our results suggest that soil in OM site, despite constant disturbance during long time (scything, hay raking and sheep grazing), has probably a stable mesofauna community with the highest abundance of Oribatida. Our results have provided new knowledge about ecosystems in traditional farmland and can be used in monitoring programmes of post-arable land.

AB  - The magnitude and urgency of the biodiversity crisis is widely recognized within scientific and political organizations. However, a lack of integrated measures for biodiversity has greatly constrained the national and international response to the biodiversity crisis. Thus, integrated biodiversity indexes will greatly facilitate information transfer from science toward other areas of human society. The Nature Index framework samples scientific information on biodiversity from a variety of sources, synthesizes this information, and then transmits it in a simplified form to environmental managers, policymakers, and the public. The Nature Index optimizes information use by incorporating expert judgment, monitoring-based estimates, and model-based estimates. The index relies on a network of scientific experts, each of whom is responsible for one or more biodiversity indicators. The resulting set of indicators is supposed to represent the best available knowledge on the state of biodiversity and ecosystems in any given area. The value of each indicator is scaled relative to a reference state, i.e., a predicted value assessed by each expert for a hypothetical undisturbed or sustainably managed ecosystem. Scaled indicator values can be aggregated or disaggregated over different axes representing spatiotemporal dimensions or thematic groups. A range of scaling models can be applied to allow for different ways of interpreting the reference states, e.g., optimal situations or minimum sustainable levels. Statistical testing for differences in space or time can be implemented using Monte-Carlo simulations. This study presents the Nature Index framework and details its implementation in Norway. The results suggest that the framework is a functional, efficient, and pragmatic approach for gathering and synthesizing scientific knowledge on the state of biodiversity in any marine or terrestrial ecosystem and has general applicability worldwide.

AB  - Eight microsatellite markers for the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) were developed to assess the amount of genetic variation for nine Dutch root vole populations from four different regions, and to evaluate the degree of differentiation and isolation. All eight microsatellite loci were found to be highly variable with observed heterozygosity values ranging from 0.61 to 0.82. These values are similar to those observed for more distant populations from Norway, Finland and Germany. Therefore, the populations seem not particularly depauperate of genetic variation at the microsatellite level. Genetically, the Dutch populations were found to have diverged considerably. Pairwise comparisons of all populations studied revealed Fs, values significantly greater than zero for most comparisons. However the magnitude of these values considerably depends on the compared population pair The level of differentiation between local populations within Dutch regions is generally significantly lower than the differentiation between Dutch regions. The level of differentiation between Dutch regions, however, is not significantly different from that between populations of larger geographical distance. This implies that the regional Dutch populations are both isolated from each other and from other European populations. The observation that even local populations show low but significant genetic differentiation may be indicative for progressive isolation of these populations.

AB  - The making of high-stumps in today's forestry is becoming more and more common and several studies of these have shown their high conservation value for many wood living species, especially saproxylic beetles. However, the amounts of dead wood and bark surface on high-stumps are small compared to the amount on the ordinary cut stumps and further there have been no studies on the fauna of ordinary cut stumps.        By sieving bark from ordinary (low) stumps and high-stumps (at ground level and at breast height) of Norway spruce we investigated whether there were differences in the saproxylic beetle community between low-stumps, high-stumps at ground level and high-stumps at breast height. We also tested whether beetle species showed preferences for any of the three substrate types.        A total of 10,984 saproxylic beetle individuals divided into 67 species, were collected from 128 low- and high-stumps on 16 clear-cuts in southern Sweden. The number of species found in high-stumps at ground level (53) was significantly higher than the numbers found in high-stumps at breast height (38) and low-stumps (39). Many of the caught species showed substrate preferences and an ordination showed that there are different beetle communities at the tree different substrate types. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the southern and central parts of Finland, Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) lives in large non-fragmented spruce-dominated forests. Due to the reduction of such forests, Siberian jay has disappeared from the southern parts of Finland. This study analyzed continuous-cover uneven-aged forest management as a way to maintain Siberian jay habitats simultaneously with timber production. Continuous cover management is able to provide the necessary spatial and temporal continuity of forest features important to the viability of Siberian jay populations. The study analyzed the relationship between habitat quality of Siberian jay and profitability of uneven-aged management of Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Profitability was evaluated by the net present value of timber sales, calculated with 2% discount rate. The results showed that uneven-aged management that maximizes economic profitability is not seriously in conflict with the maintenance of feeding habitats; there was a temporary decline in habitat quality after the cutting treatment but the decline was not drastic and the habitat recovered during the 15-year cutting cycle. Maintenance of nesting habitat reduced the profitability of timber production by 50-60% and wood production was decreased by 23%. Since nesting habitats cover only some tens of hectares within a home range of 200-500 ha, the impact of habitat maintenance on timber production would be rather small in continuous cover forest management.

AB  - A fine-scale fragmented ar ea (twenty-two 40 x 40 m clear-cuts) and a coarse-scale fragmented area (three 150 x 150 m clear-cuts) were created in a spruce forest in Norway during 1995-1996. Before and after the logging, in 1994 and 1997 respectively, ground beetles were sampled in pitfall traps between the clear-cuts and from an untouched control area. Seven eurytopic forest species accounted for 99% of the catch. In the fine-scale fragmented area the abundance of Leistus terminatus was significantly negatively affected by fragmentation, whereas in the coarse-scale fragmented area L. terminatus, Trechus obtusus and Calathus micropterus were significantly negatively affected. No clear indications of area or edge effects were found. Isolation effects probably were minimal. The ambiguity in the explanation of the results is likely to be due to species-specific and complex responses to the different aspects of habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Twenty-six Hooded Crows (Corvus corone cornix) breeding in a fragmented farmland-forest landscape in southeastern Norway were radio-tracked between April and June in three years. The 95 % home range size averaged 0.15 km(2). The proportional distribution of habitat categories in the home ranges was compared with that in the landscape; EDGE (forest <30 m from open habitats) and FIELD (mainly pastures and gardens) ranked first, followed by CROP (farmland ploughed annually), OLD (forest >30 m from open habitats) and YOUNG (clear-cuts and young planted forest). The same ranking was found when the habitats used were compared with those available within the home ranges. Crows devoted more time to perching, mostly in EDGE, than to foraging, mostly in FIELD and CROP. Use of EDGE increased with increasing availability of EDGE in the home range, but the crows used EDGE more than expected from availability only as long as the proportion of EDGE was <0.40. Home range decreased as the proportion of EDGE in the home range increased. The results suggest that an increase in the farmland-forest edge-to-area ratio may increase the density of breeding Hooded Crows, and thus increase the predation risk on bird nests in edge habitats.

AB  - Questions Does the influence of forest edges on plant species richness and composition depend on forest management? Do forest specialists and generalists show contrasting patterns?        Location Mesic, deciduous forests across Europe.        Methods Vegetation surveys were performed in forests with three management types (unthinned, thinned 5-10 years ago and recently thinned) along a macroclimatic gradient from Italy to Norway. In each of 45 forests, we established five vegetation plots along a south-facing edge-to-interior gradient (n = 225). Forest specialist, generalist and total species richness, as well as evenness and proportion of specialists, were tested as a function of the management type and distance to the edge while accounting for several environmental variables (e.g. landscape composition and soil characteristics). Magnitude and distance of edge influence were estimated for species richness per management type.        Results Greatest total species richness was found in thinned forests. Edge influence on generalist plant species richness was contingent on the management type, with the smallest decrease in species richness from the edge-to-interior in unthinned forests. In addition, generalist richness increased with the proportion of forests in the surrounding landscape and decreased in forests dominated by tree species that cast more shade. Forest specialist species richness, however, was not affected by management type or distance to the edge, and only increased with pH and increasing proportion of forests in the landscape.        Conclusions Forest thinning affects the plant community composition along edge-to-interior transects of European forests, with richness of forest specialists and generalists responding differently. Therefore, future studies should take the forest management into account when interpreting edge-to-interior because both modify the microclimate, soil processes and deposition of polluting aerosols. This interaction is key to predict the effects of global change on forest plants in landscapes characterized by the mosaic of forest patches and agricultural land that is typical for Europe.

AB  - Wood fuel production has increased remarkably, but its environmental effects within the forest ecosystem have not yet been studied much. We investigated the immediate effects of two series of forest management treatments, which produce timber and forest chips, on the volume and decay classes of coarse woody debris (CWD). One of the treatment series included logging and residue harvesting (LRH) and mounding (M), while the other series included LRH and mounding combined with stump harvesting (MSH). We hypothesized that, i) LRH reduces CWD, excluding stumps; ii) the more intense the soil preparation treatment is, M vs. MSH, the more CWD is destroyed; iii) both LRH and soil preparation treatments (M and MSH) reduce the occurence of snags, highly decayed CWD and deciduous CWD in particular. Ten sample plots in mature managed Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) dominated forests were located in Southern Finland. The total volume of CWD on the sample plots was measured three times: before and after LRH, and after M or MSH. LRH significantly decreased the volume of snags and the combined volume of snags and logs. MSH significantly decreased the total volume of CWD, while M had no significant effect on the volume of CWD. The middle and highly decayed CWD were destroyed most easily in the treatments.

AB  - The simultaneous control of insect pests and compliance of conservation targets in conifer-dominated forests has intensified public debate about adequate post-disturbance management, particularly in protected areas. Hence, mechanical bark treatments, such as debarking, of disturbance-affected trees have been widely promoted as an on-site method of pest control that accounts for conservation targets because woody biomass is retained. However, the effects of debarking to non-target biodiversity remain unclear. We analyzed data from a two-and-a-half-year field survey of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and parasitoid wasps in twelve artificial windthrows, created by pulling down mature Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) with winches. Each experimental windthrow comprising one control tree, one completely debarked tree and one bark-scratched tree. Insects were sampled using stem emergence traps. Fruiting bodies of wood-inhabiting fungi, number of wood wasp emergence holes, and number of holes made by foraging woodpeckers were assessed by visual counts. We recorded the amount of time needed to complete debarking by machine, bark-scratching by machine and bark-scratching by chainsaw each on 15 separate trees to estimate the economic costs of mechanical bark treatments.        Our results revealed that both debarking and bark-scratching significantly decreased numbers of the emerging target pest Ips typographus to in median 4% (debarked) and 11% (scratched bark) of the number of individuals emerging from untreated control trees. Compared to control trees, debarking significantly reduced the species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles, and parasitoid wasps. By contrast, bark-scratching did not reduce the overall species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles or parasitoid wasps. The time needed for bark-scratching by machine was significantly lower than debarking, whereas bark-scratching by chainsaw needed a similar amount of time as conventional debarking. However, bark-scratching did have some negative effects in common with debarking, such as the significant reduction of wood wasps emergence holes and the reduction of holes made by foraging woodpeckers. Hence, bark-scratching of downed trees, like debarking, might affect higher trophic levels of biodiversity and should be applied only if pest management is urgently needed. We urge policy makers and natural resource managers to rapidly shift current pest management toward new techniques of bark scratching, particularly in protected areas. Such a shift in post-disturbance pest-control will foster ecosystem integrity at lower economic cost compared to debarking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grazing is an important management action to conserve biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands but it is important to understand how grazing influences the life-history components and population dynamics of plant species. In this study, we analysed effects of grazing intensity and abandonment on population dynamics of the semi-natural grassland species Knautia arvensis which is an important nectar source for pollinating species and an indicator of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We recorded life-history stage, survival, establishment of seedlings and ramets, number of inflorescences and grazing marks on permanently marked individuals in eight populations in mid-Norway for three consecutive years. Matrix modelling was used to estimate population growth rates and elasticities, and life Table response experiments (LTREs) were used to assess the contribution of different life-history components to the observed variation in population growth rates between different management treatments. Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effect of management on vital rates and number of inflorescences as well as damage to K. arvensis individuals. Populations in abandoned grasslands had more inflorescences, a lower proportion of seedlings and a higher proportion of flowering ramets compared to populations in grasslands under high grazing intensity. There were no differences in population growth rates between different grazing intensities. Fecundity however, contributed more to the growth rate in grazed grasslands compared to abandoned grasslands where clonal regeneration contributed the most. Survival of non-flowering rosettes made the largest impact to overall growth rates. Our results indicate that a long life-span and clonal growth buffer the effect of environmental change in abandoned grasslands and that there is a trade-off between fertility and clonal regeneration in K. arvensis populations.

AB  - Aim Biotic interactions have a central role in defining species assemblages, realized both through negative and positive impacts. However, forecasts of how these interactions affect biodiversity across landscapes are challenging ( and lacking) because the outcome of interactions depends not only on the identity of the interacting species but also on local environmental conditions. Thus, we study how biotic interactions manifest across a landscape.        Location High-latitude northern Finland and Norway ( 69 degrees N, 21 degrees E).        Methods We modelled the influence of a dominant shrub, Empetrum hermaphroditum, on spatial patterns of species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens ( using cover of the shrub as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of interaction with other species) across a topographically variable landscape.        Results The relationship between the cover of the dominant shrub and species richness differed between guilds, being strongest for vascular plant richness, and varied considerably along environmental gradients. The dominant shrub showed stronger negative impact on vascular plant richness under less abiotically extreme conditions. For lichens, the relationship was the opposite: under mild conditions, species richness increased with the cover of the shrub. Incorporating specific leaf area ( SLA) data into analyses revealed that the dominant shrub affected species with high SLA ( typically competitive species of resource-rich environments) most negatively.        Main conclusions Our findings show how the impact of a dominant species varies across a landscape, with distinctly different effects on competitive and stress-tolerant vascular plants, and on bryophytes and lichens. Spatial predictions of biodiversity trends under global environmental change could, therefore, critically benefit from accounting for context-dependent impacts of biotic interactions.

AB  - The area of species-rich hay meadows in Norway has been drastically reduced during the 20th century. This continuing process results in fragmentation and isolation of remaining habitats. Small and isolated populations may have reduced gene flow. This is a crucial factor for the structure and cohesiveness of populations. Gene flow in plant species is regulated by pollen and seed dispersal, and pollen dispersal is controlled by the species' mating system. As part of a research project on habitat fragmentation three meadow species (Dactylorhiza sambucina, Hypochoeris maculata, Polygala vulgaris) with different life strategies were therefore selected for studies of their mating systems. A hand pollination experiment showed that both Dactylorhiza sambucina and Polygala vulgaris were self-compatible. Seed set in H. maculata was low and the species may be considered as pseudo-self-compatible or self-incompatible. Using Bawa's (1974) criteria, however, also Hypochoeris maculata should be considered as self-compatible. All three species enhanced outbreeding but P. vulgaris also proved to be a good selfer and autogamous.

AB  - Compared to the other northern large carnivores, wolverines Gulo gulo are thought to be the most sensitive species with regard to habitat changes and human disturbance. Nowadays wolverines in Scandinavia are found in remote high alpine areas, and we investigated whether human development through presence of infrastructure has relegated them to these areas. We analysed wolverine habitat selection and the impact of infrastructure in two study areas in Norway using compositional analysis. We found that alpine tundra with low human development was important for wolverines to locate their home ranges. Human development formed a more important factor for home range location than did habitat, because habitat selectivity was much higher in undeveloped habitats than in developed habitats. Within their home ranges, wolverines used alpine shrubland and forest, irrespective of human development. The sympatric distribution of wolverines with wild and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus indicates that wolverines are vulnerable to indirect loss of habitat. However, we hypothesise that wolverine distribution may be partly influenced by direct disturbance or higher risk of human-caused mortality associated with infrastructure. Increased human development and activity in once remote areas may thus cause reduced ability of wolverines to perform their daily activities unimpeded, making the habitat less optimal or causing wolverines to avoid the disturbed area. Our results suggest that the potential exists for further wolverine recovery in forest ecosystems with low levels of infrastructural development.

AB  - Along the succession gradient of the boreal forest ecosystem, black grouse Tetrao tetrix inhabits the early and capercaillie Tetrao urogallus the latest stages. When converting old forest to clearcuts and plantations, commercial forestry has therefore been assumed to affect capercaillie negatively and to be favourable to black grouse. During a 30-year period (1979-2008) we monitored sympatric populations of the two species in a forest in southeast Norway based on annual spring and autumn censuses and radio-marked birds. During this period, the proportion of old, semi-natural forest was halved and clearcuts and young plantations increased accordingly. The grouse populations did not change as predicted. While the trend in August numbers of adult black grouse declined, males more than females, abundance of adult capercaillie remained unchanged. Number of males at leks showed similar patterns. Equally surprising, breeding success (number of chicks per female in August) of both species increased, thus indicating that the populations were regulated more by variation in adult survivorship than by recruitment of young birds. No correlations were found with changing climatic factors (precipitation and temperatures in winter and spring, snow depth and time of snow melt), except that year-to-year breeding success was positively correlated with minimum temperatures during 2 weeks posthatch. The results are explained by a combination of more flexible habitat selection than previously assumed and a changing predator regime: In the early period, nearly all capercaillie leks were located in old, semi-natural forest, but as plantations grew older (> 30 years), new leks were established there. Similarly, while young capercaillie broods used old semi-natural forest almost exclusively when the study started, they frequently used middle-aged plantations, especially those with a ground cover of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, when these became common in later years. The increasing breeding success could largely be explained by more females rearing chicks successfully, presumably due to a marked decline in the main nest predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. A practice of thinning of the old, semi-natural forest some years prior to final harvesting probably facilitated predation of black grouse by goshawks Accipitergentilis. Contrary to many beliefs, our results indicate that both capercaillie and black grouse are quite tolerant to changes in forest management regimes. In our study, numerical and functional responses of predators (mainly red fox and goshawk) apparently played a more important role in regulating grouse numbers than habitat factors per se.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities affect habitat use by Rangifer tarandus, a particularly vulnerable species due to grouping behavior, extensive movements, and grazing ecology. We studied habitat use of GPS-collared reindeer in relation to surface mining activities during the snow-free season in Finnmark, Norway over a period of 7 years. Based on information about the mine's level of operation (amount of people, vehicles, and equipment in operation) and rock blasting schedule, we divided data into high-activity periods (workdays) and low-activity periods (mine closed for ca 2.5 days on weekends and a yearly 3-week holiday period). We further divided workdays into periods with and without rock blasting and associated high-noise days. We found that reindeer significantly reduced habitat use at closer distances to the mine, indicating an influence zone up to 1.5 km. Reductions in use were strongest closest to the mine in high-activity periods. No avoidance effect of the mine was found beyond approximately 0.9 km for the 3-week holidays, 1.0 km for weekends, and 1.5 km for workdays with or without rock blasting. Compared to holidays and weekends, probability of use was reduced by 30-34% within 1.3 km from the mine for workday blasting periods, and up to 35% within 1.4 km for other workdays. Since averted areas can be partly utilized again within days or weeks following intensive mining activity periods, reduced mining activity in crucial periods for reindeer, such as during calving and migration, can be an effective mitigation measure.

AB  - The Great Snipe Gallinago media is considered to be an endangered species. This paper examines its food and habitat use on a sub-alpine/low-alpine breeding area in central Norway. It was estimated that earthworms constitute more than 90% of Great Snipe food (by weight). Feeding birds selected the low herb willow scrub vegetation community and to a lesser degree eutrophic fen. Birds did not selectively feed on eutrophic dwarf birch/juniper heath despite it being the third most used vegetation community by virtue of its extent. Although soil penetrability, vegetation cover and earthworm density varied across vegetation communities, Great Snipe selected sites with similar habitat characteristics in different vegetation communities. Great Snipe seemed to select for an optimal combination of soil penetrability and earthworm density, and for medium scrub cover. Nests were found in a broad range of vegetation communities, but only low herb willow scrub was selectively used. However, an equal number of nests was found in eutrophic fen due to its larger extent. Dense vegetation cover around nests and short flushing distance of incubating females indicate low sensitivity to disturbance. We consider the Great Snipe to be a food and habitat specialist, requiring habitats rich in sub-surface invertebrates to breed. This may explain its scattered distribution in Scandinavia, and may render it vulnerable to habitat modification and loss.

AB  - Human disturbances in the alpine region can have long-lasting ecosystem effects because biological recovery in harsh environments proceeds slowly. As a by-product of the exploitation of hydroelectricity, surplus masses from tunnel excavations are deposited as spoil heaps in the alpine landscape. The typical management goal for such spoil heaps is that their species composition converges towards that of their undisturbed surroundings. At present we lack knowledge of the rate as well as the direction of these successions. We examined the species composition of five alpine spoil heaps in western Norway at two points in time, after 6-16, and 24-34 years of succession, with regard to vegetation cover, species richness, species composition and soil conditions. We also compared the vegetation of spoil heaps with that of their surroundings. After ca. 30 years, bryophyte and lichen cover and species richness were similar to those of their surroundings, while cover of vascular plants and species richness recovered more slowly. The vegetation development of spoil heaps appears safe-site limited rather than dispersal limited. Topsoil development was slow, but some accumulation of organic matter was observed. The species composition followed a successional trajectory in direction of the vegetation of the surroundings. Estimated linear successional rates indicate that 35-48 years are needed from construction of spoil heaps till a species composition more or less similar to their surroundings has been reached. However, these estimates are likely to be over-optimistic because successional rates tend to decrease with time. Based on our results we propose three changes to the current spoil-heap construction practice that will improve their restoration: (1) to increase surface unevenness, by which the number of safe sites will increase and germination and establishment success will be enhanced; (2) to increase substrate variability, by adding more of fine-grained materials more species will establish in shorter time; and (3) to use seed from local sources or to let the spoil heaps regenerate naturally.

AB  - A common management aim is to keep large herbivore densities at sustainable levels. However, measuring grazing pressure is difficult. We seek combinations of herb species and morphological traits that serve as indicators of grazing pressure in alpine areas of Scandinavia. In a fully replicated, landscape-scale experiment with three replicates of each of three levels of sheep density (zero, low, and high), we measured grazing frequency (numbers of plants eaten, as a proportion), flowering frequency, and plant height for 17 common herb species for two consecutive grazing seasons. For eight species, grazing frequency varied significantly between treatments, and for four of these species there was additional strong between-year variation. The estimate for total grazing frequency of herbs decreased when more species of decreasing preference were included, and it was significantly lower in the second grazing season. There were large between-year differences in plant height probably related to weather patterns. A grazing treatment effect on plant height was found only for two species. Flowering frequency in selected species changed even at low sheep densities and was thus not considered suitable except for indicating ungrazed areas. Grazing frequency of three herbs, Saussurea virgaurea, Rumex acetosa, and Pyrola minor, provided a useful indicator of total grazing pressure, as these species were grazed only at high sheep density. Our study area is likely to be representative of alpine areas in southern Norway, but we advise careful calibration using monitoring procedures before similar management decisions on stocking rates can be fully implemented in other ecosystems.

AB  - The species composition of wood-inhabiting fungi (polypores and corticoids) was investigated on 1138 spruce logs and 992 pine logs in 90 managed and 34 natural or near-natural spruce and pine forests in SE Norway.        Altogether, the study included 290 species of wood-inhabiting fungi. Comparisons of logs with similar properties (standardized tree species, decay class, dimension class) in natural and managed forests showed a significant reduction in species number per log in managed spruce forests, but not in managed pine forests. The species number per log in managed spruce forests was 10-55% lower than on logs from natural spruce forests. The reduction was strongest on logs of large dimensions. A comparison of 200-400 spruce logs from natural and managed forests showed a 25% reduction in species richness corresponding to a conservative loss of ca. 40 species on a regional scale.        A closer inspection revealed that species confined to medium and very decayed spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests, whereas species on early decay classes and decay generalists were unaffected. Similarly, species preferring large spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests. Forest management had strongest impact on low-frequent species in the spruce forests (more than 50% reduction), whereas common species were modestly affected. Corticoid fungi were more adversely affected than polypore fungi.        These results indicate that wood-decaying fungi in pine forests are more adapted to forest disturbances than spruce-associated species. Management measures securing a continuous supply of dead wood are more important in spruce forests than in pine forests. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Question Many species-rich communities are associated with a foundation species. While we often have detailed information about the foundation species, we know less about its associated species. We explore such a situation, comparing the responses of lichen species associated with different tree taxa, which differ in successional strategy, to the environmental change that takes place when the surrounding trees are clear-cut. Location Boreal forests in Sweden. Methods We illustrated general differences in lichen species composition among four tree taxa and three stand categories using ordination of species occurrences. To analyse responses to clear-cutting we modelled the occurrence probability individually for 144 epiphytic lichen species from the lower 2 m of 2,400 tree trunks of four tree taxa in 130 stands, and compared trees in closed-canopy forests with those retained in logged stands, using Bayesian hierarchical models. Results The composition of lichens on aspen trees deviated clearly from that on the other tree species. Also lichen responses to logging differed among main host tree taxa, where lichen species associated with birches, European aspen, and Scots pine increased in probability of occurrence on trees in logged areas compared to intact forest, while lichen species associated with Norway spruce decreased. We found that time lags for changes in occupancy existed primarily in the increase, but not in the decline, of the groups of lichens associated with different tree taxa. Conclusions Lichens associated with different tree taxa vary in their response to the environmental change brought about by logging, but in a way that differs from the differences in species composition among host trees. Our results highlight the importance of considering the taxa of trees in forest management for the conservation of their associated lichen species. The extent to which the ecology of foundation species influences their associated species merits further inquiry, since such knowledge may facilitate predictions of responses of associated species also in other species-rich communities.

AB  - Stumps constitute a large wood resource in managed forests, but have generally been little studied in terms of insect biodiversity. Basic knowledge of the stump fauna is necessary to e.g. assess the value of other dead wood, such as high stumps created for conservation purposes. This study focuses on early arriving bark- and wood-boring beetles and associated insect enemies (predatory Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and parasitic Hymenoptera) in fresh stumps of Norway spruce Picea abies. Ordinary low stumps were compared with mechanically created 4 m high stumps. Wood samples for insect rearing were cut from low (n = 28) and high stumps (n = 21) on five one-summer-old clearcuts in Sweden. High stumps were sampled at the base and at 1.5 m above ground. All emerging insects were determined to species or genus level. Proportion of stumps inhabited, density and Shannon's index for diversity and evenness were calculated. At least 17 phloem/fungivorus (predominately Scolytidae and Cerambycidae) and 8 predatory beetle taxa (mostly Cleridae and Nitidulidae) were recorded, as well as 9 parasitoid taxa (Pteromalidae, Eurytomidae and Braconidae) associated with bark beetle hosts. Most taxa occurred in both low and high stumps. High stumps were slightly better for parasitoids in terms of occupancy, density and index values. Phloem/fungivorus and predatory beetles occurred in nearly all low and high stumps (93-95%), whereas parasitoids were more often recorded at 1.5 m in high stumps (95%) than in the base (48%) or in low stumps (54%). Three parasitoid species occurred in significantly higher densities in high stumps than in low stumps (Rhopalicus quadratus, Rhopalicus tutela and Dendrosoter niiddendorffi). The results show that above-ground parts of fresh spruce stumps to a high degree may serve as habitat for secondary and mostly harmless bark beetles. They also barbour generalist predators and parasitoids, including important enemies of forest pests such as the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The results support previous studies showing positive effects of high stumps on insect biodiversity, and suggest that also hi-her trophic levels such as parasitic Hymenoptera are favoured.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a growing problem worldwide. Particularly in river systems, numerous dams and weirs hamper the movement of a wide variety of species. With the aim to preserve connectivity for fish, many barriers in river systems are equipped with fishways (also called fish passages or fish ladders). However, few fishways provide full connectivity. Here we hypothesized that restricted seasonal opening times of fishways can importantly reduce their effectiveness by interfering with the timing of fish migration, for both spring-and autumn-spawning species. We empirically tested our hypothesis, and discuss the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of affected migration timing. We analyzed movements of two salmonid fishes, spring-spawning European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and autumn-spawning brown trout (Salmo trutta), in Norway's two largest river systems. We compared their timing of upstream passage through four fishways collected over 28 years with the timing of fish movements in unfragmented river sections as monitored by radiotelemetry. Confirming our hypothesis, late opening of fishways delayed the migration of European grayling in spring, and early closure of fishways blocked migration for brown trout on their way to spawning locations during late autumn. We show in a theoretical framework how restricted opening times of fishways can induce shifts from migratory to resident behavior in potamodromous partial migration systems, and propose that this can induce density-dependent effects among fish accumulating in lower regions of rivers. Hence, fragmentation may not only directly affect the migratory individuals in the population, but may also have effects that cascade downstream and alter circumstances for resident fish. Fishway functionality is inadequate if there is a mismatch between natural fish movements and fishway opening times in the same river system, with ecological and possibly evolutionary consequences for fish populations.

AB  - (1) The population of moose (Alces alces) at Gausdal Vestfjell in central Norway migrate from low-lying summer areas to winter areas situated at higher altitudes.  This is contrary to the general pattern of migration among herbivores.        (2) Archaeological evidence along the migration route shows that the migratory behaviour of this population follows a traditional pattern that has been unchanged since 5000 B.P. despite a deterioration in the quality of their winter range through the loss of high quality pine forests.        (3) The low calf production of the GV population (0.6 calves per cow greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years), compared with neighbouring populations (0.79-1.27 calves per cow greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years) are likely to reflect poor winter ranges.        (4) Migratory traditions in moose appear to log behind environmental changes, and changing migratory routes to utilise better quality range may take many generations.

AB  - Simple Summary Wind power can contribute to a necessary reduction in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. However, wind farm construction and infrastructure might cause other problems, for example, reducing biodiversity. In parts of their distribution area, eagle owls are scarce and declining, and not much is known about their tolerance for different kind of disturbances. Here, we investigated the presence-absence of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in 48 territories in the central part of Norway before the construction of eight wind farms and power lines started, and shortly after the construction period. Eagle owls living within 4-5 km away from the disturbance left their territories to a higher extent than eagle owls living even further away. Wind power is useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the construction and operation might have negative effects on biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of wind farm and power line construction on territory occupancy in the vulnerable Eurasian eagle owl. We investigated 48 eagle owl territories before and after the whole construction period and a short operation period with the use of sound meters. We found that territorial eagle owls within 4-5 km from the wind farm and power line construction disturbance left their territories to a significantly higher extent (41% reduction in the number of territories with eagle owls) compared with the eagle owls in territories further away (23% reduction). The distance from the nest site to the disturbance was significantly shorter for those territories that were abandoned compared with territories where the birds stayed. Possible reasons for this decline might be a higher mortality caused by collisions, desertion and avoidance of wind power areas caused by the noise and disturbance from their construction. In addition, there are possible indirect effects, for example reductions in prey species may force eagle owls to abandon their territories. The construction period lasted much longer than the period with active wind turbines and power lines in this investigation, but we cannot separate the effects of the two because the investigations were only possible in the eagle owl breeding season, and the wind turbines were activated shortly after the construction period. Our results imply that careful investigations are needed to detect the possible occurrence of eagle owls near any type of construction work. Studies of these territories should strongly influence how and when the construction work can be carried out, but more investigations are needed to find details about the influence of distance.

AB  - Society's increased interest in renewable energy and materials put pressure on forest biomass production. Intensive fertilization of young Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest has a considerable potential to increase the production of tree biomass, but there are concerns about negative side-effects on forest ecosystem structure and function. Fertilization of young forest has a strong negative impact on light availability below the tree canopy and reduces the abundance of the forest floor vegetation. The silvicultural practice of thinning has been shown to affect composition and diversity of forest floor vegetation, and it has been proposed, but rarely tested, that the effects of fertilization are interdependent on the type of thinning performed. Here we present responses on the forest floor vegetation following 25 years of fertilization and eighth years after thinning (removing 30% or 60% of the tree basal area) in a Norway spruce forest in northern Sweden. Fertilization without thinning led to a considerable reduction in abundance of most forest floor plants. It did not affect species richness but resulted in an increased evenness. Thinning reduced the fertilization effects so that the total abundance of the vegetation was comparable to the unfertilized control plots. A considerable change in species composition had, however, taken place. Thinning favored early-successional species and pteridophytes on the account of dwarf-shrubs. Thinning also increased species richness and functional richness, while none, or negative effects were seen on evenness and functional evenness, respectively. A comparison with data from the National Forest Inventory revealed that the type of vegetation generated by fertilization, without or in combination with thinning, is a type of vegetation very uncommon in Swedish boreal forests. First, we conclude that the effects of fertilization on forest floor vegetation in young stands of Norway spruce are largely dependent on thinning regime. Secondly, fertilization will, independently of thinning, lead to considerable changes in the vegetation, including a functional shift from dwarf-shrubs with ericoid mycorrhiza to ferns and grasses with arbuscular mycorrhiza, resulting in a functional type of vegetation that is rare in this part of the boreal forest biome. Finally, in contrast to what previously has been suggested for unfertilized forests, thinning of fertilized forests may not promote late-successional species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Young forest stands and clearcuts in the boreal forest created by modern forestry practices along with meadows of abandoned summer farms may contribute as feeding areas for beef cattle. The patchy distribution and varying quality and diversity of forage on such unimproved lands may affect cattle productivity. Weight gain of 336 beef cows and 270 calves free-ranging during three summer grazing seasons was monitored in boreal forests of south-eastern Norway, stocked at either high (0.16 cows ha(-1)) and low (0.04 cows ha(-1)) stocking densities. We used linear mixed effect models for assessing intrinsic correlates of weight gain in cows and calves in the two areas. Habitat use and home range size of a subsample of 53 cows were monitored by using GPS collars programmed to log locations at 5 min. intervals during the grazing season. Additional extrinsic correlates of weight gain for the subsampled cows using a linear mixed model were also tested.        Average weight gain of beef cows grazing at the low stocking density was positive among cows of early maturing breeds (represented by Hereford) gaining 24 +/- 2.8 kg (+/- SE), while cows of late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais) had an average weight loss of 9 +/- 8.4 kg. The average weight gain was negative for beef cows of both early (Herefords) and late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais but also Limousin and Simmental) at the high stocking density. Within both breed groups, there was a negative relationship between breed-specific average weight of cows at turnout and weight gain during the grazing period, while a prolonged grazing period was slightly positively related to weight gain. There was no relationship between weight gain and home range size and proportion of grazing habitat for the 53 cows fitted with GPS collars.        Higher weight gains in calves of the low compared to the high stocking density area was found. However, there was no breed effect of weight gain in calves. Across study areas, spring-born suckler calves gained more weight than autumn-born calves (92 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 65 +/- 4.4 kg). Also, there were higher weight gains for spring-born bull-calves than spring-born heifers (100 +/- 2.4 kg vs. 94 +/- 2.2 kg).        Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to achieve acceptable weight gains for cattle grazing coniferous forest by finding breeds suitable for these extensive areas and stocking at moderate densities.

AB  - Mycetophilids is a species-rich insect group for which the ecological requirements in temperate forests are poorly understood. This study of mycetophilids was based on trap samples from 15 oak-dominated sites in the boreonemoral zone of southern Sweden. Species richness and composition were analysed in relation to environmental variables at a local and at larger scales (multiple regression), and compared to results from similar studies in spruce-dominated sites in the boreal zone of Norway (PCA and two-sample t tests). Regressions showing a dominance of regional factors over local in-site variables agree with species-richness models assuming that local communities most often are unsaturated. Precipitation (inter-correlated with elevation) was the strongest factor for explaining the variation in species-richness, which is consistent with previous results indicating that mycetophilids are disfavoured by drought. In addition to precipitation, the area of mixed forest with high biodiversity values (woodland key habitats and protected areas) was a positive factor for species-richness, probably because such habitats combine elements of both coniferous and deciduous forests. PCA ordination revealed a clear separation of the species composition between boreal and boreonemoral forests. Species-richness in boreal forest was significantly higher than in boreonemoral forest, indicating a preference for boreal habitats in many of the species. For mycetophilids and other drought-sensitive insects, it is suggested that (partial) cutting in some dense successional oak stands should be avoided, and that some invading spruces should be tolerated.

AB  - Schemes for transformation of even-aged monoculture forest management regimes into near-natural regimes are currently applied throughout the Atlantic region of Europe. This is mainly due to poor ecological stability, low economic performance, and decrease in biodiversity in existing forests. In this study, we analysed the simultaneous transformation of adjacent even-aged stands (a forest division) into mixed conifer/broadleaved stands. The case area is found in a conifer-dominated Danish forest and consists primarily of Norway spruce, European beech, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. An economic evaluation of several transformation strategies was carried out by simulation. An area based combined Markov chain and Dynamic yield table model was used. Analyses were conducted under risk of wind throw.        Strategies were defined by length of the cutting cycle and the diameter class harvest volume proportions of each tree species. As a reference point, an optimal strategy was determined using strict target diameter harvesting. It was assumed that such a regime would not achieve the desired change in stand structure due to the narrow diameter distributions of the existing stands as well as the present forest structure. Two groups of harvest strategies were analysed: passive strategies entailing harvesting mature and over-mature trees, and active strategies entailing harvest of immature, mature and over-mature trees; and three lengths of cutting cycles were applied: 2, 5 and 8 years. A transformation period of 80 years was assumed for the entire forest division.        The importance of the local forest conditions was evident: for all strategies, an economically over-mature forest structure resulted in large harvest income at the beginning of transformation, leading to small differences between the strategies and thus increasing flexibility in the choice of strategy. When trees were harvested before or after economic maturity, opportunity costs depended on strategy. Such costs must be taken into account when forcing a fast transformation, e.g. for biological or recreational reasons. For the worst performing strategy, the overall loss was 34% compared with the optimal strategy in terms of total expectation value. Regarding area distribution of tree species and size classes, the differences between strategies were insignificant at the end of the transformation period. The active strategies with a 2-year cutting cycle were the least vulnerable to wind throw but had the lowest economic performances, emphasising the trade-off between vulnerability and operational costs (entry costs).

AB  - We studied the ten-year response of understory vegetation and lichens in mature boreal Norway spruce forests to five felling treatments in southern Finland. The stand level treatments represent a range in intensity of overstory removal: clear felling (CF) with site preparation and planting, retention felling (RF) (7% of stand volume retained) with site preparation and planting, gap felling with site preparation (GFs) (50% retained) and without planting, gap felling (GF) (50% retained) without site preparation or planting, and selection felling (SF) (67% retained) without site preparation or planting. Disc trenching was used for site preparation. Vegetation was sampled before and 1, 2, 3 and 10 years after the treatments. Both species cover and number decreased significantly immediately after all treatments. The resistance of understory vegetation, defined as the amount of change in the community structure caused by the treatments, increased in the order CF < RF < GFs < SF < GF. The dynamics of vascular plants depended on the felling intensity. The dynamics of non-vascular species depended both on the felling intensity and site preparation. CF and RF caused almost similar effects on understory vegetation composition. Local extinctions of mosses and liverworts were caused especially by CF and RF. However, even with 67% retention, 18 bryophyte species were lost during the study period. Loss of bryophyte species was higher after SF than after GF treatments, suggesting that aggregated retention is better for maintaining bryophyte species in felling areas. The resilience of understory vegetation increased in the order CF < RF < GFs < GF < SF. The abundance of mosses, liverworts and dwarf shrubs had not recovered ten years after treatments. Herb species were the most resilient compared to other species groups. We conclude that in intensively managed forest landscapes, GF and SF can be recommended as alternatives to CF to better maintain understory diversity on the stand level. However, the aim with GF and SF treatments was to further harvest the stands. Subsequent removal of the residual stands may cause substantial changes in understory vegetation for the whole treatment area. To protect late-successional bryophytes in felling areas in mesic spruce forests, high levels of retention and minimizing soil disturbance would be required. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Most investigations of human impacts on biodiversity have been conducted within 1-3 years post-disturbance, although many biological responses develop over a longer period of time and annual community variation cannot be fully controlled. We therefore conducted a follow-up of carabid beetles over ten years in Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated forests in Southern Finland, harvested using replicated logging treatments of different intensities. We collected carabids using pitfall traps in 1995 (prior to logging) and during four post-harvest seasons, 1996-98 (three first post-harvest summers) and 2006 (ten years after harvesting). The treatments were clear-cutting (no retained trees), modified clear-cutting (retention of three groups of 20-30 trees within a one-hectare plot) and gap cutting (three 0.16-ha openings within a one-hectare plot), and control (mature unharvested forest). (1) Total species richness and open-habitat carabids increased in gaps and in the two clear-cutting treatments, whereas forest carabids were slightly less abundant in clear-cuts than in the other treatments in 1997. These patterns were most evident in the second and third post-harvest summers. (2) Open habitat carabids were less abundant and less speciose in both cleared and retained patches of gap cuts than in clear-cuts, Pterostichus adstrictus was more abundant in clear-cuts than in retained patches of modified clear-cuts or gap cuts, and carabid assemblage was more altered in both types of clear-cut than in gap cuts. (3) Ten years after logging, open-habitat carabid numbers were still elevated, whereas Calathus micropterus was less abundant, in the two types of clear-cut than in gap cuts or control stands. (4) We also found remarkable annual variation in carabid assemblages, such that was independent of logging. We conclude that even modest retention provides long-term support for forest carabids, but also that their full assemblage recovery takes longer than 10 years.

AB  - In order to meet the requirements of the Paris climate agreement, the EU plans to set new goals for forest carbon sinks. This may affect the future development potential in the wood using sectors in Europe and their contribution in the new circular bio-economy. We explore the potential consequences mainly on the forest sector in the region consisting of EU and Norway (EU + N), but also globally, that would arise if the countries in the EU + N constrained economic utilization of their forest resources. For the analysis, we use the global forest sector model EFI-GTM, which also incorporates the trade in wood and wood products.        Due to the globally growing demand for forest products and available forest resources in the rest of the world (RoW) outside of the EU + N, the leakages of harvests, forest industry production and employment opportunities from EU + N to RoW would be considerable. Decreased wood harvests and forest industry production in the EU + N would raise the wood and forest industry product prices globally, and increase production and employment in the forest sector in RoW. Due to the harvest leakage, climate mitigation benefits of the policy in the form of forest carbon sinks in the EU + N would be considerably reduced. Also, there would be inter-sectoral carbon leakage, as part of the wood consumption would shift to more energy-demanding competing materials.

AB  - Building new power lines is required to satisfy increasing demands for the transmission of electricity, and at the same time the road network is expanding. To provide guidelines for the routing of new power lines and roads, it is essential to test whether linear features deter or attract movements of animals in different landscape settings. Using GPS relocation data from 151 moose (Alces alces L.) in central Norway, we tested for barrier and corridor effects of roads, power lines and rivers and accounted for forest cover, the topographical orientation of linear features and the placement of other nearby linear features. We predicted step selection probabilities for different movement options at varying distances from linear features and linear feature combinations. Barrier and corridor effects of linear features altered moose movements, although effects were minor compared to the effects of topography and forest cover. Moose did not avoid crossing power lines, unless the placement of power lines along contour lines impeded movements across them. In contrast, moose avoided crossing of roads and rivers in forests. Moose more likely moved along linear features when getting closer to linear features. Barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/river combinations compared to single linear features. Likewise, the barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/power line combinations, but not power line/river combinations compared to single linear features, when moose were close to the edge of those features. The inconsistent pattern could be due to the low sample size. We found indications of higher disturbance potential of roads compared to power lines and rivers. Managing vegetation in power line rights-of-way to provide abundant browse could counteract possible disturbance, while wildlife overpasses could mitigate road fragmentation effects.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands and their species and populations are declining rapidly throughout Europe, bringing about a need for successful vegetation recreation methods. To maintain biodiversity and ecological services of semi-natural grasslands, we need more knowledge on the relative performance of different recreation methods. In a replicated experiment in western Norway, we evaluated two hay transfer methods (hard or light raking of local hay), sowing of local seeds and natural regeneration for recreating semi-natural grassland in a road verge. We compared treated trial plots with their respective donor plots (where hay and seeds were harvested) for three successive years by evaluating vegetation cover, species richness and species transfer rates, and vegetation dynamics analysed by Bray-Curtis compositional dissimilarity (BC) and GNMDS (Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling) ordination. Vegetation cover at the trial site exceeded that of donor sites in three years. Transfer rates of common species were high for seed sowing and both hay transfer procedures. Species composition in trial plots for all three treatments became significantly more similar to donor plots, but was still relatively dissimilar after three years. Natural regeneration showed a different temporal pattern and also had a higher successional rate. The species composition of the other treatments followed the same trajectory toward the donor sites as revealed by GNMDS. We found relatively small differences between the two hay transfer methods and seed sowing. Transfer of local hay therefore appears to be a successful method of establishing local species when recreating semi-natural grasslands, and is generally cheaper than using commercial local seed mixtures.

AB  - Forest fragmentation increases the proportion of edge area and this, in turn, induces changes in forest structure, species composition and microclimate. These factors are also strongly determined by the forest management regime. Although the interactive effects of edges and density on forest plant communities have been extensively studied, little is known about the response of the belowground communities. Here we investigated the variation of soil microbiota in 45 deciduous broadleaved forests along a latitudinal gradient from Italy to Norway at a continental scale across Europe. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) were used to map the microbial community in the forest edge and interior across three forest densities (dense, intermediate, open forest). Microbial community composition was only affected by forest edge effects and not by forest density. We did not find any interaction effects between forest density and distance-to-edge. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were significantly more abundant in edges and Gram-negative bacteria more abundant in interiors, respectively. The microbial community composition was closely related to soil pH, soil potassium and nitrogen, texture (percent sand) and soil temperature. Soil pH was positively correlated with the saprotrophic fungi and potassium was positively correlated with Gram-negative bacteria but negatively correlated with Actinobacteria. In sum, we reveal the notable effects of forest edges on the soil AMF abundance. This result indicated that AMF could possess a stronger affinity with species growing in the edges, which may help to improve plant perfor-mance under hostile conditions herein.

AB  - Aim To contribute directly to Norway's national and international commitments to systematic, long-term conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) by ensuring both the in situ and ex situ protection and availability of a broad range of CWR genetic diversity within the country.        Location Norway.        Methods We created a priority list of CWR within Norway based upon four main criteria including economic value from national to global level of associated crops and inclusion in Annex 1 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Species presence data were gathered from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and used for predictive species distribution modelling in MaxEnt. CAPFITOGEN software was utilized to create an ecogeographic land characterization (ELC) map and to identify complementary in situ genetic reserves and ex situ collecting priorities which target the full range of ecogeographic diversity of taxa.        Results An inventory of 204 priority CWR within Norway was compiled. A grid cell complementary network of 19 in situ areas (similar to 10 km(2) ) conserved 201 priority CWR, and a separate analysis identified a protected area complementary network of 23 reserves that conserved 181 priority taxa. For ex situ conservation, 177 taxa did not have ex situ accessions and of the 24 with accessions, 15 had the minimum of five populations conserved throughout their ecogeographic range.        Main conclusions We present the first comprehensive national recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation of 204 priority CWR in Norway. Proposals target the conservation of the ecogeographic diversity of the priority CWR and hence their genetic diversity. Both the priority taxa and the methodology used are applicable at regional and global scales with the recommendations not only helping Norway to meet its international obligations for conservation of genetic diversity of CWR but also ensuring this genetic diversity is available for use in tackling global food security.

AB  - In a boreal forest in southeast Norway, we evaluated the relative importance of stand-level structures versus historical data on forest age and absence of logging (at two spatial scales; stand and surrounding landscape), on the presence and abundance of the wood-rotting fungi Phellinus nigrolitnitatus and Cystostereum murraii. Both species are often considered to be indicators of long-time continuous presence of downed logs in Scandinavian forest stands.        Of the stand-level variables, number of logs in late stages of decay was positively related to P. nigrolimitatus presence, while diversity of coarse woody debris was positively related to the abundance of the species. Both the presence and abundance of P. nigrolitnitatus was strongly and positively correlated with the area of forest uninterrupted by major disturbance the past 240 years (equalling 140 years of "old growth continuity") in the surrounding landscape (80 ha). For C murraii, consistent results was not found.        We conclude that the causal relationships between ecological continuity and possible indicator species must be investigated on a larger scale than the stand-level as the condition of the forest surrounding a stand can have a large influence on these relationships.

AB  - The heaths of Lygra, western Norway, were investigated, and 19 communities at the association level were distinguished. Distinct ecotypes of Ranunculus acris and Poa humilis and microspecies of Euphrasia were restricted to the grass heaths. No distinct ecotypes were found in the Calluna-dominated vegetation. It is suggested that the regular burning, which has been part of the management of the area, has activated the seed bank of the ericaceous heath, and thus maintained genetic diversity and slowed down ecotype differentiation. The grass heaths, with no combustible material, have been unaffected in this way. Permanent plots in the two dominant heath types, dry heath (Vaccinio-Callunetum) and wet heath (Ericetum tetralicis) were followed over six years and the data analysed using a modification of Jaccard's index, allowing for species abundances.

AB  - The diet strategy of the wolf in Europe is reviewed on the basis of 74 basic and 14 additional literature sources. The comparative analysis reveals clear dependence on the latitude (and, therefore, on the changing environmental conditions) correlated with the wild ungulate abundance and diversity. Following a geographic pattern, the wolf is specialised on different species of ungulates: moose and reindeer in Scandinavia, red deer in Central and Eastern Europe and wild boar in Southern Europe. Where this large prey is taken, the roe deer is hunted with almost the same frequency in every region. The wolf diet in Europe shows two ecological adaptations formed by a complex of variables: 1. Wolves living in natural habitats with abundance of wild ungulates feed mainly on wild prey. 2. In highly anthropogenic habitats, with low abundance of wild prey, wolves feed on livestock (where husbandry of domestic animals is available) and take also a lot of plant food, smaller prey (hares and rodents) and garbage food. The frequency of occurrence of wild ungulates in the diet of wolves in North Europe varies from 54.0% in Belarus to 132.7% in Poland, while that of livestock is in the range from 0.4% in Norway to 74.9% in Belarus. In South Europe, the frequency of occurrence of wild prey varies from 0% in Italy and Spain to 136.0% in Italy, while of domestic ungulates ranges between 0% and 100% in Spain. The low density or lack of wild prey triggers the switch of the wolf diet to livestock, plant food (32.2-85% in Italy) or even garbage (up to 41.5% in Italy).

AB  - The coastal area of western Norway is characterized by heathlands of Calluna vulgaris, developed and maintained through grazing by domestic animals and burning. Pollen diagrams from five sites (Vingen, Skatestraumen, Selja, Osneset, Gossen) are presented and the heathland development discussed. Soil, topography and cultural history differ between the sites, whereas the climate is relatively similar along the coast. The investigation shows presence of Calluna in forest openings from the Mesolithic, but cultural activity including grazing did not result in heathland development before 1300 cal. BC. The oldest heathland is found in an area of moraine and marine sand well suited for agricultural activity where heathlands developed as part of the farming economy. At sites with poorer soil, heathland development took place in the Iron Age and medieval time, as outfield pastures for farms located in some distance to the sites. By the medieval monastery at Selja, heathlands existed from the Late Iron Age and expanded into grasslands and cereal fields when the monastery was abandoned. The investigation illustrates the variation that exists in heathland development and the different factors that may cause the development. Until 1000 years ago, the coastal landscape probably held a mosaic of vegetation types; heathlands, grasslands, cultivated fields and forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L., 1758) and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix L., 1758 (= Lyrurus tetrix (L., 1758))) are two sympatric Eurasian lekking grouse species that differ markedly in habitat affinities and social organization. We examined how size and spacing of leks in pristine (Russia) and managed (Norway) forests were related to habitat and social behavior. Leks of both species were larger and spaced farther apart in the pristine landscape. Capercaillie leks were regularly spaced at 2-3 km distance, increasing with lek size, which in turn was positively related to the amount of middle-aged and older forests in the surrounding area. Black grouse leks were irregularly distributed at shorter distances of 1-2 km, with lek size explained by the size of the open bog arena and the amount of open habitat in the surroundings. At the landscape scale, spatial distribution of open bogs and social attraction among male black grouse caused leks to be more aggregated, whereas mutual avoidance in male capercaillie caused leks to be spaced out. In the pristine landscape, large-scale and long-term changes in forest dynamics owing to wildfires, combined with an aggregated pattern of huge bog complexes, presumably provide both grouse species with enough time and space to build up bigger lek populations than in the managed landscape.
