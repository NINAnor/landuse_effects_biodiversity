Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil? Location: West andmid-Norway. Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect. Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower. Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.","abandonment and boreal and climate and functional diversity and functional traits and plant diversity and plant species richness and semi-natural grasslands and soil and taxonomic diversity and FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY and SPECIES RICHNESS and TRAIT RESPONSES and VEGETATION and IMPACT and PRODUCTIVITY and ECOSYSTEMS and STRATEGIES and MANAGEMENT and FRAMEWORK","10.1111/jvs.12543     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12543",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Different domestic animal species graze in different areas of the landscape. Therefore, grazing stocks composed of different species have an unequal effect on the landscape. This study compares the influence of four domestic animal species (cattle, sheep, goats, reindeer) on landscape dynamics in Jotunheimen, a Norwegian mountain range. Interviews and maps showing grazing land of domestic animals were performed to collect information about land use in the summer farm surroundings. Grazing pressure maps (prior to 1960 and 1960-2002) using the land use information obtained, and vegetation maps (from the 1960s and 2002) using aerial photographs, were digitized. Vegetation was spatially linked with grazing pressure using GIS and multiple multinomial and linear regressions were used to investigate each species' effect on vegetation type change and displacement of the forest line, respectively. The results show that cattle grazing influenced transitions from grasslands, cattle together with goats affected transitions from heaths, and cattle, goats, and reindeer influenced displacement of the birch forest line. High grazing pressure from these three domestic animals suppressed forest and scrub establishment in open habitats. Only goats, however, caused transitions from scrub and birch forest to open vegetation types. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To determine to what degree this practice challenges timber production and wildlife management, we need a better understanding of basic cattle ecology. What do cattle, typical grazers, feed on in a habitat typically used by browsers? We determined cattle's resource use and selection at three scales: habitat and microhabitat selection when foraging and diet selection. Boreal forest is dominated by grass-poor habitats, and despite their strong selection for grass-rich habitats, cows spent a lot of time in suboptimal habitats, like old bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) spruce (Picea abies) forest. However, they managed to find grass-rich habitat patches within those, selecting for patches with bentgrass (Agrostis spp.). Graminoids, mainly wavy hair-grass (Avenella spp.), tussock grass (Deschampsia), and true sedges (Carex spp.), made up the biggest part of the fecal samples. Woody plants, mainly willow (Salix spp.), Vaccinium spp., pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.), made up 9.4% ± 4.7% of the samples, a value lower than reported for other forest grazing cattle. Cattle avoided woody plants in their diet and selected for graminoids. They preferred deciduous over coniferous species. At these low stocking densities, the cows were grazers in this browser's habitat. Moreover, they selected rather on habitat and patch scale than for individual plants within a given habitat patch, considered typical for a grazer. Their grass-rich diet indicates little overlap with the diet of local wild ungulates, which are mostly browsers. Their aversion of spruce and selection for graminoids and deciduous trees indicates low conflict risk for browsing damages and even a beneficial weeding effect on trees planted for timber production. © 2023 The Author(s)","Beef cattle and Feeding ecology and Picea abies and Resource selection and Silvopastoralism and Norway and boreal forest and browsing and cattle and diet and feeding ecology and grazing and habitat selection and pastoralism and pasture and pine and resource use and Cattle and Trees","10.1016/j.rama.2023.12.004","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2023.12.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Here, we show the significance of a nature-based solution to a landfill-contaminated aquifer in southeast Norway. Groundwater physicochemical parameters monitored for twenty-eight years were used as a proxy to infer natural remediation. Results show that concentrations of the major chemical variables decreased with time and distance until they tailed off. An exception to this was sulphate, which showed an increase, but apparently, exhibits a stationary phase. The water types were found to be most similar between samples from active landfill and post-closure stages, while samples from the stabilised stage showed a different water type. All the chemical parameters of samples from the stabilised stage were found to be within the Norwegian drinking water standards, except iron and manganese, which were only marginally above the limits, an indication of a possible recovery of this aquifer. The findings highlight the significance of natural attenuation processes in remediating contaminated aquifers and have significant consequences for future contamination management, where natural remediation can be viewed as an alternative worth exploring. This is promising in the wake of calls for sustainable remediation management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).",NA,"10.1038/s41598-021-94041-7","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94041-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

"6","rayyan-656137719","The effects of human disturbance on the activity of wild reindeer in different physical condition","Rangifer","We compared two Norwegian wild reindeer herds, Knutsho in excellent physical condition and Hardangervidda in poor physical condition, before and during disturbance by human hunters in order to test whether physical condition effected foraging strategy under stress. Both herds were being regularly hunted (man had been a natural predator on reindeer since prehistoric time). The well-fed Knutsho animals were ca. 30% larger at the start of the hunting season in late August. Before exposure they foraged less and walked more, i.e. were more selective than the Hardangervidda animals which were in energetically lower condition and foraged significantly more and spent less time moving between habitat patches and less time standing. After exposure to hunters disturbed Knutsho animals aggregated into significantly larger groups than before hunting and stood alert more, while Hardangervidda animals spent the same minimum amount of time foraging but moved significantly more and spent almost no time standing. The frequency of disturbance was not significantly different between the two herds and their speeds of movement after disturbances were similar. The hunter kill success rate was also similar in the two areas. The energetic costs, measured as relative body weight loss during the hunting season, was higher for the initially less well-fed Hardangervidda animals, and higher for both herds compared to that from a less disturbed herd (Forelhogna). We hypothezise that while standing still and alert in aggregated groups is risky, it is still more risky to move, but potentially more rewarding if a better habitat could be found. More well-fed Knutsho animals, which aggregated and stood still, conserved allready stored energy, compatible with a time minimizer risk aversive strategy. The Hardangervidda animals which were in poorer condition increased travelling time to an extent that suggested a risky nutrient miximizer strategy in the phase of stress. Effekter av menneskelige forstyrrelser pa aktiviteten til villrein i forskjellig fysisk kondisjon. Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: For a teste om fysisk kondisjon innvirket pa beitestrategien, sammenlignet vi to norske vill-reinflokker, Knutsho i utmerket fysisk kondisjon og Hardangervidda i darlig fysisk kondisjon for og etter forstyrrelser av jegere. Begge flokker er regelmessig jaktet pa (menneske har vaert naturlig predator pa rein siden forhistorisk tid). De velnaerte rein pa Knutsho var 30% tyngre enn sine artsfeller pa Hardangervidda ved starten av jaktsesongen sent i august. For jakten beitet de mindre og gikk mer, d.v.s. var mer selektive enn Hardangerviddareinen. Disse var energetisk sett i en darligere forfatning, beitet mer og brukte mindre tid bade til a ga mellom beiteomradene og til a sta. Etter a ha blitt utsatt for forstyrrelser av jegere, samlet Knutshoreinen seg til storre grupper enn for jakten og sto mer vaktsomme. Hardangerviddareinen derimot, brukte den samme minimumstid til beiting, men gikk signifikant mer enn for jakten. Den brukte heller nesten ingen tid til a sta i ro. Hyppigheten av forstyrrelser var ikke signifikant forskjellig mellom de to grupper og deres bevegelses-hastighet etter forstyrrelse var den samme. Jegernes jaktsuksess i form av fellinger var ogsa den samme i de to omrader. Energiutgiftene, malt som relativt tap av kroppsvekt gjennom jaktsesongen, var hoyere for Hardangerviddareinen med darligere ernaeringsstatus i startfasen. For begge flokker var energiutgiftene hoyere sammenlignet med en mindre forstyrret reinflokk (Forelhogna). Vi tror at, selv om det a sta stille og vaktsomt i samlet flokk er risikofylt, sa er det enda mer risikofylt a bevege seg, noe som dog kan vaere mer lonnsomt, om de finner et bedre beiteomrade. Mer velfodd Knutshorein, som samlet seg og sto i ro, bevarte mer av sin allerede opplagrede naeringsenergi, noe som minimaliserer tidsforbruk til naeringssok og som er en risikoavvergende strategi. Hardangerviddarein, som var i darligere hold, okte tiden for beitesok i en grad som antyder en mer risikofylt strategi under stresspavirk-ning for a maksimalisere beiteopptak.

Section 1. in the upper part of the river, is located above a waterfall impassable for migratory salmonids and is surrounded by grazing land. Sections 2 and 3, in the middle and lower parts of the river, are influenced by agricultural activity. Total nitrogen concentration varied between 250 and 1000 μg l −1 in section 1 and 1500 and 2500 μg l−1 in sections 2 and 3. Total phosphorus (Tot-P) concentrations also increased with decreasing altitude: 19–46 μg l−1 in section I and 31–101 μg l −1 in sections 2 and 3. The number of 0 + salmon in sections 2 and 3 varied between 30.1 and 167.8 specimens 100 m −2, with means 90.2 and 95.2 specimens 100 m −2:, respectively; the density of 1 + salmon, with mean values of 16.3 and 51.0 specimens 100m−2 was significantly correlated with the original fry density. The growth rate of 0+ salmon was not inversely related to cohort density, but was significantly so for 1 + salmon. Mean annual salmon production in section 2 was 1595 g 100 m−2 year 1, and in section 3 was 841 g 100m−2 year 1. A logarithmic function gave the best curve fit between salmon production and mean annual biomass. Thus, production levelled off for the highest values recorded in section 2, and perhaps approached the carrying capacity of the stream. A multiple regression analysis showed that yearly variation in 1 + salmon density was the single factor accounting for most of the total variability in production (60%). Variation in water temperature and nutrient content were not significantly related to variation in fish production. Densities of brown trout were low in all sections (<20 specimens 100m −2). Fry density was highest in section 3 and parr density in section 1.

This paper examines its food and habitat use on a sub-alpine/low-alpine breeding area in central Norway. It was estimated that earthworms constitute more than 90% of Great Snipe food (by weight). Feeding birds selected the low herb willow scrub vegetation community and to a lesser degree eutrophic fen. Birds did not selectively feed on eutrophic dwarf birch/juniper heath despite it being the third most used vegetation community by virtue of its extent. Although soil penetrability, vegetation cover and earthworm density varied across vegetation communities, Great Snipe selected sites with similar habitat characteristics in different vegetation communities. Great Snipe seemed to select for an optimal combination of soil penetrability and earthworm density, and for medium scrub cover. Nests were found in a broad range of vegetation communities, but only low herb willow scrub was selectively used. However, an equal number of nests was found in eutrophic fen due to its larger extent. Dense vegetation cover around nests and short flushing distance of incubating females indicate low sensitivity to disturbance. We consider the Great Snipe to be a food and habitat specialist, requiring habitats rich in sub-surface invertebrates to breed. This may explain its scattered distribution in Scandinavia, and may render it vulnerable to habitat modification and loss.","PLUVIALIS-APRICARIA and PREDATION-RISK and TRADE-OFF and EFFICIENCY and WOODCOCK and BEHAVIOR and Breeding and Ecosystem","10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07227.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07227.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Wetlands/peatlands, Mountains","Observational studies"
"10","rayyan-674230332","Mass development of aquatic plants: Effects of contrasting management scenarios on a suite of ecosystem services","Journal of Applied Ecology","Dense beds of aquatic plants are often perceived as nuisance and therefore mechanically removed, often at substantial cost. Such removal, however, may affect a range of ecosystem functions and consequently also the ecosystem services that benefit society. We studied five cases: River Otra (Norway), River Spree (Germany), Lake Kemnade (Germany), Lake Grand-Lieu (France) and Hartbeespoort Dam (South Africa). In all, nuisance aquatic plant growth is managed, but dominant species, geographic setting and major societal uses are different. We quantified 12 final ecosystem services as flows per area and year in biophysical and monetary terms. Quantified services were food and fodder production, commercial fisheries, hunting and gathering wild products, hydropower production, drinking and irrigation water production, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, active and passive recreation and biodiversity conservation (nonuse). These services were related to aquatic plant cover via a range of ecosystem functions, and the effects were estimated of three plant removal regimes on the relative importance of the quantified ecosystem services and on the total sum of the monetary estimates (total economic value, TEV). The three removal regimes were ‘maximum removal’, ‘current practice’ and ‘do nothing’. In all five cases, TEV was dominated by different forms of recreation. TEV was highest for Lake Kemnade, where visitor densities were highest. TEV was most sensitive to the different management regimes in Lake Kemnade, because a threshold in aesthetic appreciation was passed in the ‘do-nothing’ regime, and in Hartbeespoort Dam, because of the effect on boating and angling. In the other cases, the different removal regimes had little effect on the estimated TEV. Synthesis and applications. Since recreation dominated the estimated societal benefits in the studied ecosystems, also where provision of hydropower, drinking water or irrigation water were relevant, effects on recreation should be a core consideration in the management of nuisance aquatic plants. Furthermore, aquatic plant management strategies will benefit from taking into account the differences in perceived nuisance among different categories of recreative users before engaging in costly removal. © 2023 The Authors.

Over 16,000 km of rivers and lakes were available to sea trout in these watercourses, spanning from the temperate to Arctic regions. Sea trout were classified to be in a good or very good state in fewer than 25% of the watercourses and in a poor or very poor state in almost 40%. Twenty-nine watercourses had lost their sea trout populations. Salmon lice from aquaculture salmon farms had by far the largest adverse effect on sea trout among the human impact factors, both in the number of watercourses (83%) and river area affected (60%), and the total effect on sea trout abundance. Agriculture and hydropower production also had strong adverse impacts (35% and 19% of watercourses), but substantially lower than that caused by salmon lice. Culverts related to road crossings and other habitat alterations also had impacts on sea trout in many watercourses (27%). Exploitation of sea trout has been reduced in Norway in recent years, both in the marine and freshwater fisheries. Yet, the exploitation pressure was moderate or high in almost 14% of the watercourses where the state of sea trout was poor or very poor, suggesting a high potential for overexploitation in these. The state of sea trout was best in the northern sparsely populated areas. However, distribution of watercourses with sea trout in a poor or very poor state was more linked to aquaculture, agriculture, and hydropower production than human population density. The developed approach for large-scale mapping of state and pressures, which is vital for prioritizing management measures, may inspire other nations in their conservation effort for this important species. © 2024 The Authors.

Gene flow is a result of both landscape connectivity and demographic processes determining the number of dispersing individuals in space and time. Thus, the effect of human impact on processes determining the level of genetic diversity must be interpreted in the context of basic ecological conditions affecting survival and recruitment. When the intensity of human impact and habitat suitability correlate, the effect on genetic diversity and gene flow may be challenging to predict. We compared genetic diversity, gene flow and landscape resistance in two contrasting landscapes in Norway for the pond-breeding amphibian Triturus cristatus: a highly human-impacted, agricultural landscape with ecologically productive habitats, and a forested landscape with less productive habitats and lower levels of human impact. Our results show that genetic diversity was higher and gene flow lower within the forested landscape. Microclimatic moisture conditions and vegetation cover were important determinants of landscape resistance to gene flow within both landscapes. There were indications that landscape resistance was increased by minor roads in the forested landscape, which was not the case for the agricultural landscape, suggesting a higher vulnerability to human interference within the landscape matrix for the populations in less productive habitats. Our findings suggest that the effect of human impact on genetic diversity may not be straightforward but modulated by the ecological conditions underlying local demographic processes. Populations within both landscapes seem to be vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity, but due to different mechanisms. This has implications for the choice of relevant management actions, that is, increasing population stability may be more relevant within an agricultural landscape still permeable for dispersal, while conserving dispersal corridors may be more appropriate in the forested landscape, to avoid isolation and increased genetic drift. © 2023 The Authors.

Species richness of plants generally decreases along elevational gradients or peaks at intermediate elevations. Land use including grazing by wild and domestic herbivores also affects plant communities and diversity, but how grazing affects plant diversity along elevational gradients is less clear. 2. Using a field experiment along an elevational gradient in Norway, we tested whether the impact of grazing on plant diversity interacts with elevation. Vascular plant communities were sampled following 10years of experimental sheep grazing (decreased/ceased, maintained and increased densities of 0, 25 and 80sheepkm(-2)) and compared with pre-experimental baseline data. 3. The impact of grazing on species richness (alpha diversity) was investigated at the species level, and temporal community variance was used to investigate community stability (temporal beta diversity). Spatial community variance (spatial beta diversity) at the enclosure level was used to test whether community homogenization differed between treatments. 4. Species richness and temporal stability varied between treatments and along the elevational gradient. Where grazing was ceased, species richness declined by up 3.7 species at low elevations and increased by up to 3.5 species at high elevations, whilst where grazing was maintained or increased, changes were less extreme along the elevational gradient. 5. Temporal stability of plant communities was highest at low elevations and lowest at high elevations where grazing was reduced. There were no clear differences in spatial homogenization between grazing treatments, although spatial species turnover increased in heathlands where grazing decreased. 6. Synthesis. This study shows that the effect of grazing on plant diversity varies with elevation, and grazing herbivores can thus directly affect elevational patterns of plant diversity. Grazing can buffer changes in plant communities and species richness, even in the face of other environmental drivers such as climatic warming.","beta diversity and buffering and climate warming and determinants of plant community diversity and structure and herbivory and homogenization and land use and species richness and stability and turnover and SPECIES-RICHNESS and LARGE HERBIVORE and BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION and ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT and VEGETATION PATTERNS and SPATIAL SCALES and BETA DIVERSITY and TREE COVER and SHORT-TERM and SHEEP","10.1111/1365-2745.12133     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12133",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

Forests that have never been clear-cut and have old growth characteristics, termed ""near-natural,"" often harbor different and richer species assemblages than managed forests. Alternative management strategies may be able to balance the needs of biodiversity with the demands of forestry, but evaluation efforts are limited by the challenges of measuring biodiversity. Species richness is frequently used as a simple measure of biodiversity, but research indicates that it may not adequately capture community-level changes. Alternatively, trait-based measures of biodiversity may prove to be useful, but research is lacking. In this paper, we use a large dataset that includes 339 obligate saproxylic beetle species collected over a decade in the boreal region throughout southern Norway to: (1) establish if there is a difference in beetle community composition between near-natural and managed forests; and (2) determine which measures of beetle biodiversity best indicate forest naturalness. We arranged the sites in an ordination space and tested for differences in community composition between these forest types. We also tested different measures of biodiversity to determine which were the most predictive of forest naturalness. We found a clear difference in community composition between near-natural and managed forests. Additionally, three measures of biodiversity were most predictive of forest naturalness: proportional abundance of predators, community weighted mean (CWM) of wing length, and CWM of body roundness. The probability that a forest was near-natural increased with the proportional abundance of predators but decreased with CWM wing length and body roundness. Although species richness was higher in near-natural forests, the effect was not significant. Overall, our findings underscore the conservation value of near-natural forests and highlight the potential of several measures of biodiversity for determining forest quality.

Earlier research has indicated that this species may be negatively influenced by clearcutting practices. However, the effects of current clearcutting methods on pine marten occurrence in conjunction with changing environmental conditions are not well known. In this study, we combined four complete years of nationwide data collected during a long-term camera trap (CT) monitoring program in Norway. We employed a multi-scale occupancy model to investigate the relationship of pine marten occurrence to clearcuts (regenerating stands & LE; 10 years old) and forests & GE; 120 years old. We also examined pine marten detection in relation to habitat features (i.e. dominant microsite characteristics) and to varying snow depths and temperatures. We found no relationship between pine marten occurrence and the proportions of old forest and clearcuts at the landscape scale. At the habitat-patch scale, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with the presence of old forest patches and terrain ruggedness, but not with clearcuts & LE; 100 m from sites. At CT sites near clearcuts, the detection probability was negatively correlated with snow depth. In contrast, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with snow depth at CT sites > 100 m from clearcuts. Furthermore, the detection probability increased with temperature and the presence of boulders at CT sites. Boulders may provide important access points for foraging, and cover for resting and predator avoidance. While previous studies indicate that pine martens prefer older forest and avoid clearcuts, the current level and scale of clearcutting in Norway does not appear to influence its occurrence at the landscape scale.","clearcutting and Martes martes and multi-scale occupancy model and Norway and old forest and pine marten and BIALOWIEZA NATIONAL-PARK and LOGGED BOREAL FORESTS and HABITAT SELECTION and NORTHERN EUROPE and LONG-TERM and PATTERNS and MANAGEMENT and DYNAMICS and FRAGMENTATION and POPULATION","10.1002/wlb3.01113","https://doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.01113",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. ‘passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce. © 2023 The Authors.

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 ± 0.03; average ± standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 ± 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 ± 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 ± 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 ± 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 ± 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 ± 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW. © 2023 by the authors.","conservation and grassland and management and pollinators and spatial modeling and wild bees and Biodiversity and Decision making and Ecosystems and Forestry and Land use and Population distribution and Remote sensing and Dynamic world and Grassland and Grassland habitat and Land cover maps and Pollinator and Spatial modelling and Species distribution modeling and Species distributions and Species richness and Wild bee and Conservation","10.3390/rs15071749","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071749",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Rotational prescribed burning increases landscape heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different regeneration stages of heather. Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) responses to fire in traditionally managed coastal heathland have already been studied, but less is known about other beetle groups in this system. We compared the beetle activity between patches of mature and recently burnt heath, by looking at diversity indices, species composition and ecological preferences and traits. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find an increase in beta diversity after disturbance, but we found that prescribed burning offers micro-environmental conditions which enhanced the activity of sun-loving and xerophilous species. We also identified new indicator species for both mature and pioneer heath in five beetle families: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, Leiodidae, and Scirtidae. Rotational prescribed burning was confirmed to be an efficient conservation tool for specialists without affecting the overall diversity of the site.

Ecological restoration is acknowledged as an important tool to counteract this negative trend. The semi-natural calcareous sand dune meadows in south-western Norway are known for their high species diversity, much like similar habitats of high conservation value across Europe today. The recent cessation of grazing has caused a decline in several endangered species associated with these habitats due to the advancement of secondary succession. We conducted a long-term restoration experiment in semi-natural dune meadows over 16 years to examine if current trends in biodiversity loss could be reversed and at what time-scale restoration measures take effect. Three treatments were applied; mowing annually, mowing bi-annually, and a control (no mowing). In fields mown annually species richness increased significantly over time. However, the response was slow and significant effects were first seen after year 10. Fields mown bi-annually also showed a similar trend but the response was more variable. Several characteristic meadow species were favoured by annual mowing while they declined in the control fields. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a compositional shift, indicating the re-arrangement/-establishment of typical meadow vegetation in the mown sites, contrasting the further successional development in the control. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term data in supporting good evidence-based management. Annual mowing is effectively restoring this unique habitat, but restoration efforts need to be sustained over many years to show positive effects.","cessation of grazing and coastal sand dune meadows and long-term experiment and plant species richness and ecological restoration and semi-natural grasslands and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE HISTORY and SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS and AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE and DUNE VEGETATION and RESTORATION and MANAGEMENT and DIVERSITY and IMPACT and FRAGMENTATION","10.3112/erdkunde.2017.02.03     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2017.02.03",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"
"27","rayyan-674230534","Estimating mortality of small passerine birds colliding with wind turbines","Scientific Reports","As demand for renewable energy is rising, wind power development is rapidly growing worldwide. In its wake, conflicts arise over land use changes converting pristine nature into industrial power plants and its associated adverse biodiversity effects, crowned by one of the most obvious and deadly consequences: bird collisions. Most post-construction studies report low levels of avian mortality, but the majority of these studies are conducted primarily on larger birds. However, the diversity and abundance of small passerine birds are rarely reflected in the carcass surveys, although they in numeric proportion to their abundances should be the most numerous. The assumption that surveys find all carcasses seems thus rarely fulfilled and passerine mortality is likely to be grossly underestimated. We therefore designed an experiment with dummy birds to estimate mortality of small-bodied passerines and other small-bodied birds during post-construction surveys, tested in a medium-sized wind farm in western Norway. The wind farm was surveyed weekly during the migration periods by carcass survey teams using trained dogs to find killed birds. The dogs in the carcass surveys were more successful in locating the large than the small dummy birds (60–200 g), where they found 74% of the large dummy birds. Detecting the smaller category (5–24 g) was more demanding and the dogs only found 17% of the small dummy birds. Correcting the post-construction carcass survey outcome with the results from the experiment leads to an almost fourfold increase in estimated mortality rates, largely due to the low detection rate of the smallest category. The detection rates will naturally vary between wind farms, depending on the specific habitat characteristics, the efficiency of the carcass surveys and the search intervals. Thus, implementing a simple experiment with dummy birds to future post-construction surveys will produce more accurate estimates of the wind turbine mortality rates, and thus improve our understanding of the biodiversity effects of conforming to a more sustainable future. © 2023, The Author(s).","Animals and Dogs and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and Energy-Generating Resources and Passeriformes and Power Plants and Renewable Energy and Wind and adverse drug reaction and animal and dog and electric power plant and energy resource and renewable energy and wind","10.1038/s41598-023-46909-z","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46909-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant–herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species.

The tree cover was the most important factor deciding the composition of vegetation. Time since abandonment was not completely correlated to tree cover, as some plots had a dense canopy and others were situated in the open. The total species number decreased with number of years since abandonment in plots > 0.001 m(2) and <100 m(2). The highest species number in I m2 plots was recorded in the managed site, with 38 species of phanerogams. Fourtyeight % of the indicators of traditional management present in the managed site was recorded in the site which had been abandoned for 30 years.

"35","rayyan-674267678","Restoration of alpine spoil heaps: Successional rates predict vegetation recovery in 50 years","ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","Human disturbances in the alpine region can have long-lasting ecosystem effects because biological recovery in harsh environments proceeds slowly. As a by-product of the exploitation of hydroelectricity, surplus masses from tunnel excavations are deposited as spoil heaps in the alpine landscape. The typical management goal for such spoil heaps is that their species composition converges towards that of their undisturbed surroundings. At present we lack knowledge of the rate as well as the direction of these successions. We examined the species composition of five alpine spoil heaps in western Norway at two points in time, after 6-16, and 24-34 years of succession, with regard to vegetation cover, species richness, species composition and soil conditions. We also compared the vegetation of spoil heaps with that of their surroundings. After ca. 30 years, bryophyte and lichen cover and species richness were similar to those of their surroundings, while cover of vascular plants and species richness recovered more slowly. The vegetation development of spoil heaps appears safe-site limited rather than dispersal limited. Topsoil development was slow, but some accumulation of organic matter was observed. The species composition followed a successional trajectory in direction of the vegetation of the surroundings. Estimated linear successional rates indicate that 35-48 years are needed from construction of spoil heaps till a species composition more or less similar to their surroundings has been reached. However, these estimates are likely to be over-optimistic because successional rates tend to decrease with time. Based on our results we propose three changes to the current spoil-heap construction practice that will improve their restoration: (1) to increase surface unevenness, by which the number of safe sites will increase and germination and establishment success will be enhanced; (2) to increase substrate variability, by adding more of fine-grained materials more species will establish in shorter time; and (3) to use seed from local sources or to let the spoil heaps regenerate naturally.

Capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan mortality resulting from collisions with high tension power lines (11-420 kV) was estimated, based on the number of casualties found per kilometre of power line patrolled in three boreal forest and low alpine areas. 2. The length (km) of high tension power lines crossing tetraonid habitats was estimated using Geographical Information Systems and general knowledge about species-specific habitats. Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55% was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56% black grouse habitats and 16% willow ptarmigan habitats. 3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90%, 47% and 9% of the annual hunting harvest of these species. 4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.

Expected northward expansion and encroachment on arctic tundra in response to climate warming may be counteracted by natural and anthropogenic processes such as defoliating insect outbreaks and grazing/browsing regimes. Such natural and anthropogenic changes in land cover can substantially affect FTE dynamics, alter ground albedo (index of the amount of solar energy reflected back into the atmosphere) and provide important feedbacks into the climate system. We took advantage of a naturally occurring contrast between reindeer grazing regimes in a border region between northern Finland and Norway which was recently defoliated by an outbreak of the geometrid moth. We examined ecosystem-wide contrasts between potentially year-round (but mainly summer) grazed (YRG) regions in Finland and mainly winter grazed (WG) regions in Norway. We also used a remotely sensed vegetation index and albedo to quantify effects on local energy balance and potential climate feedbacks. Although differences in soil characteristics and ground vegetation cover were small, we found dramatic differences in the tree layer component of the ecosystem. Regeneration of mountain birch stands appears to have been severely hampered in the YRG regime, by limiting regeneration from basal shoots and reestablishment of individual trees from saplings. This has led to a more open forest structure and a significant 5% increase in spring albedo in the summer grazed compared to the winter grazed regions. This supports recent suggestions that ecosystem processes in the Arctic can significantly influence the climate system, and that such processes must be taken into account when developing climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies.","Arctic vegetation and climate change and insect defoliation and grazing and climate feedback and reindeer husbandry and MOUNTAIN BIRCH FORESTS and SHRUB TUNDRA and VEGETATION CHANGES and GLOBAL PATTERNS and SNOW DEPTH and REINDEER and HERBIVORES and DYNAMICS and TREELINE and EXPANSION and Feedback and Trees","10.1007/s10021-014-9767-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9767-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

"42","rayyan-656137869","Perfect poopers; passerine birds facilitate sexual reproduction in clonal keystone plants of the boreal forest through directed endozoochory towards dead wood","Forest Ecology and Management","Berry-producing Vaccinium shrubs are keystone species in boreal forest ecosystems and their berries provide an essential food source for many vertebrates. In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris. In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns. We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.",NA,"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120842","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120842",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

However, wind farm construction and infrastructure might cause other problems, for example, reducing biodiversity. In parts of their distribution area, eagle owls are scarce and declining, and not much is known about their tolerance for different kind of disturbances. Here, we investigated the presence-absence of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in 48 territories in the central part of Norway before the construction of eight wind farms and power lines started, and shortly after the construction period. Eagle owls living within 4-5 km away from the disturbance left their territories to a higher extent than eagle owls living even further away. Wind power is useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the construction and operation might have negative effects on biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of wind farm and power line construction on territory occupancy in the vulnerable Eurasian eagle owl. We investigated 48 eagle owl territories before and after the whole construction period and a short operation period with the use of sound meters. We found that territorial eagle owls within 4-5 km from the wind farm and power line construction disturbance left their territories to a significantly higher extent (41% reduction in the number of territories with eagle owls) compared with the eagle owls in territories further away (23% reduction). The distance from the nest site to the disturbance was significantly shorter for those territories that were abandoned compared with territories where the birds stayed. Possible reasons for this decline might be a higher mortality caused by collisions, desertion and avoidance of wind power areas caused by the noise and disturbance from their construction. In addition, there are possible indirect effects, for example reductions in prey species may force eagle owls to abandon their territories. The construction period lasted much longer than the period with active wind turbines and power lines in this investigation, but we cannot separate the effects of the two because the investigations were only possible in the eagle owl breeding season, and the wind turbines were activated shortly after the construction period. Our results imply that careful investigations are needed to detect the possible occurrence of eagle owls near any type of construction work. Studies of these territories should strongly influence how and when the construction work can be carried out, but more investigations are needed to find details about the influence of distance.","anthropogenic disturbance and birds and construction and influence area and territory and tolerance and turbines and wind energy and wind farm construction and BIRD POPULATIONS and BREEDING PERFORMANCE and SPOTTED OWLS and HOME-RANGE and BEHAVIOR and DENSITY and NOISE and CONSEQUENCES and DISPERSAL and MORTALITY","10.3390/ani12091089     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12091089",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line","Observational studies"

This issue is especially evident as wind parks have increasingly been developed inside Fennoscandian forests, against the advice of international bat conservation guidelines. In this study, we aimed to describe and explain bat community dynamics at a Norwegian wind park located in a boreal forest, especially to understand potential avoidance or attraction effects. The bat community was sampled acoustically and described using foraging guilds (short, medium, and long-range echolocators; SRE, MRE, LRE) as well as behavior (commuting, feeding and social calls). Sampling was undertaken at two locations per turbine: 1) the turbine pad and 2) a paired natural habitat at ground level, as well as from a meteorological tower. We used a recently developed method for camera trapping nocturnal flying insects synchronously with bat acoustic activity. Our results reveal trends in feeding and general bat activity across foraging guilds in relation to insect availability, habitat type, wind, temperature, and seasonality. We show how seasonal patterns in behavior across guilds were affected by habitat type, temperature, and wind. We found that SRE commuting and especially feeding activity was highest in natural habitats, whereas LRE overall activity at habitats more season dependent. We found that nocturnal insect availability was positively correlated with total bat feeding activity throughout the night. Our results provide evidence for both direct and indirect risks to bat communities by wind parks: SRE bat habitat is lost to wind energy infrastructure and LRE bat may have an increased risk of fatality. Our findings provide important insights on seasonal and spatial variability in bat activity, which can inform standardizing monitoring of bats acoustically in boreal forests, at wind parks, and in combination with non-invasive insect monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

There were five replications of each of the following categories: semi-natural forests, clearcuts, and managed forests (clearcut 70-120 years ago). Clearcutting seems to induce a long lasting effect on the Mycetophilidae fauna. The semi-natural forests were more species-rich and contained more 'potentially rare' species than the two other categories. Even though managed forests and clearcuts differed in faunal composition, their species richness was not significantly different. Continuity is probably a main factor for maintaining the diversity of Mycetophilidae species. Lumping the 15 sites together, the number of species was strongly correlated with the (temporal) continuity of tree cover and substrates, which may reflect an increased diversity of fungal habitats both in dead wood and on the ground. The degree of continuity was recognized by means of indicator species of fungi, lichen and vascular plants. The amount of dead wood was correlated with the species diversity, but was probably dependent on the continuity factor, since clearcuts with much dead wood had relatively fewer species. Important elements in a strategy for conservation of the diversity of mycetophilid species seem to be: (i) to identify and protect the remnant patches of forests with long continuity, (ii) as far as possible, to practice timber harvesting in earlier clearcut forests instead of semi-natural forests.

A multiscaled study from a spruce forest in southern Norway","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","The diversity in different groups of obligate saproxylic beetles was related to ecological variables at three levels of spatial scale in mature spruce-dominated forest. The variables were connected to: (i) decaying wood, (ii) wood-inhabiting fungi, (iii) the level of disturbance, (iv) landscape ecology, and (v) vegetational structure. Several strong relationships were found at medium (1 km(2)) and large scales (4 km(2)), while only weak relationships were found at a small scale (0.16 ha; 1 ha = 10(4) m(2)). This may be explained by the local variations in habitat parameters and the high mobilities of many beetle species. Factors connected to decaying wood and wood-inhabiting fungi were clearly the most important factors at all scale levels. In particular, the variables diversity of dead tree parts, number of dead trees of large diameter and number of polypore fungi species increased the species richness of many groups and increased the abundance of many species. Eight species were absent below a certain density of decaying wood per 1 or 4 km(2). Former extensive cutting was a negative factor at large scale, probably because of decreasing recolonization with increasing distance to the source habitats. Thinning reduced the diversity of species associated with birch. The development of guidelines favouring the diversity of saproxylic beetles are discussed below.

Relationships between occurrence of the species and a number of site and stand variables were analysed by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and direct gradient analysis. Species diversity was significantly higher in old forests and in forests at higher altitudes compared to young forests and forests at lower altitudes. Old trees and snags are considered to be the most important structural components in old forests promoting species diversity of the Caliciales. Threatened or vulnerable species, such as Chaenotheca gracillima, Cybebe gracilenta, Sclerophora coniophaea and S. peronella were confined to forest on rich soils showing no correlation with forest stand age. Chaenotheca brachypoda and C. trichialis were found to be the most typical old forest species among the Caliciales. Humidiphilous species are considered to be less affected by forestry in a humid climate. A change in forestry practice towards methods imitating the natural dynamic processes is considered necessary to maintain species diversity of the Caliciales in boreal forests.

The amount of food removed from the field layer was stable through the winter. Roe deer used the lower part of the study area most heavily. At lower altitudes, older mature stands and edges between medium-aged stands and clear-cuts/plantations were preferred, pole-sized stands and edges between older mature stands and clear-cuts/plantations were used as expected from their availabilities, whereas medium-aged stands, clear-cuts and young plantations were avoided. That snow depth was an important factor determining habitat use by roe deer was evident in three ways: 1) use of areas at higher elevations decreased as winter progressed, 2) use of mature forest stands increased from early to late winter relative to open habitats, and 3) use of mature forest stands was more extensive at higher than at lower elevations compared to open habitats.","Norway","10.2981/wlb.1997.004","https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.1997.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Diversity was evaluated by means of species richness, diversity indices, relative abundance curves and rarefaction. The diversity indices appeared to be less suitable for our purpose. Species richness was higher in pine forest than in spruce forest. However, a peak in species richness was found in mosaic forest. For pooled samples (408 ha), 11 bird species recorded in pine forest were not found in spruce forest, seven species were found in spruce forest but nor in pine forest, and seven species were confined to the medium mosaics of pine and spruce forest (on average 56% pine and 44% spruce). We argue that, when mixing two habitat types A and B, the ratio of these habitats that maximize avian diversity depends on the ratio of species confined to habitat A and B, as well as the number of species favoured by the mixture of A and B.

The study area has a long history of extensive grazing by domestic animals. The floristic composition showed a continuous change along the boreal-alpine gradient. The number of species was more or less constant throughout 600 altitudinal m centred around the treeline, and the Aoristic similarity between neighbouring altitudes did not show any abrupt changes at any particular altitude. The treeline position (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) spanned 190 altitudinal m (range 980-1170 m a.s.l.). The number of trees and the basal area each decreased continuously with increasing altitude from 300 altitudinal m below the treeline. The number of birch saplings also decreased from c. 150 m below the treeline towards higher altitudes. Viable, but browsed populations of birch were present along the whole length of all transects, irrespective of aspect and geological substrate, with saplings present up to summit positions at 420 altitudinal m above the treeline. Due to browsing by sheep, mean sapling height at all altitudes above the treeline was 0.2 m. The results are discussed in terms of land use and climate change. It is concluded that future vegetation responses to diminished grazing pressure are likely to override responses forced by changing climate. Such responses could easily be misinterpreted as being governed by climate change, rather than by changes in land use.","treeline dynamics and species diversity and land use and climate change and grazing pressure and Norway and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and VEGETATION CHANGE and PICEA-ABIES and FOREST and SWEDEN and DISTURBANCE and DYNAMICS and ECOTONES and LIMIT and CONSEQUENCES and Mountaineering","10.2307/2997351     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/2997351",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Old growth species could be grouped in ecological entities of which 'dry bark species' (on old Picea trunks) and 'snag species' were the most important. A number of species showed preference for specific vegetation types with more species preferring nutrient poor stands compared to nutrient rich stands. Cyanobacterial lichens were generally less common in the old growth stands compared to intermediate stands and preferred the nutrient rich vegetation types.

Enclosures are exposed to different land-use regimes including grazing, mowing, fertilisation and soil disturbance. Pastures have never been fertilised or ploughed and the current grazing pressure is moderate. All investigated pastures are former haymaking areas. Higher conservation values of pastures compared to enclosures is reflected both in patterns of species richness and the occurrence of vulnerable species. Higher species richness in pastures is related to lower nutrient levels, lower loss of ignition in the soil, and higher levels of pH. Vulnerable species are concentrated in species-rich pastures, and have tow local abundance and regional distribution. Enclosures reflect a complexity in land-use, were the effects of mowing, fertilising and ploughing on plant community patterns could not be separated. Tree and shrub species are common in both habitats, and indicate a successional invasion of woody species.

Most species are associated with deciduous trees, particularly oak, and the majority depend on decayed wood or fungi. The forest is a mixture of Norway spruce and deciduous trees and is characterized as being very close to a primeval forest. Sixty-two species of the collected beetles are assumed to be threatened or rare in Scandinavia, 52 species are on the Red Data List in Sweden and 43 species are suggested for a similar list in Norway. Fifteen species are on a list of species threatened in the Nordic region. Compared with other thoroughly sampled forest reserves in Fennoscandia, the forest investigated had one of the richest saproxylic beetle communities known to date. The main reasons for this are assumed to be the abundance of dead wood, the diverse tree composition and the fact that the area had been inaccessible for forest harvesting due to the lack of transportation for timber.","biodiversity and forest reserve and saproxylic beetles and DEAD WOODY MATERIAL and COLEOPTERA","10.1080/02827589950152719     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827589950152719",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

The sporocarps contained 36 species of beetles, of which six species are on the Norwegian Red List. Of 12,373 individual beetles collected, 91% were Cis glabratus. Plots of species accumulation curves suggested that there may be more than 60 beetle species present in F. pinicola in the area, but that probably all the specialist Ciidae were found. The major factor influencing beetle diversity turned out to be the level of dead wood at and in the vicinity of the sampling site, with a higher number of species per unit volume of sporocarps in areas with high levels of dead wood. There were also significantly more red-listed species in those areas. Analysing the species occurrence with stepwise logistic regression, we show preferential habitat selection of the six most abundant species of Ciidae.

The most visible impacts of overgrazing are On the vegetation. In addition, soils and humus have been changed due to morphodynamic processes induced to a large extent by reindeer pasturing. Degradation of the high mountain landscapes within the last 30 years is described on 3 spatial levels: large-scale effects at specific localities, linear effects along reindeer fences, and small-scale effects on the altitudinal zonation of entire mountain systems. The structure of the ecosystem ha changed completely due to reindeer pasturing, which has resulted in landscape degradation under great pasturing pressure. The processes that influence the ecosystem as a function of different pasture intensities are described and show a complex correlation and interaction between the ecofactors. These include destruction of vegetation cover, reduction of roof density, erosion of humus and mineral soil horizons, reduction of soil moisture and soil stability, and changes in plant species composition. On the whole, degradation leads to a depression of the altitudinal belts, indicated by the new organization of the ecosystems. It can be concluded that reindeer herding at current levels is a destructive form of land use in the northern Norwegian high mountains and hence is not sustainable. The author believes that destruction of the natural environment could be reversed, although this is not to be expected.","landscape ecology and high mountains and reindeer and herding grazing and landscape degradation and Norway and Mountaineering","10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0356:HMEALD]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0356:HMEALD]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Distribution of reindeer was mapped using systematic snowmobile surveys during 1991-96 and compared with results from investigations of snow and vegetation characteristics. Maternal reindeer avoided a 10 km zone around the resort. Cows and calves increased in density from 0.6 +/- 0.6 reindeer km(-2) at 5-10 km from the resort to 7.6 +/- 2.2 reindeer km(-2) at 15-25 km from the resort. Bulls and yearlings were more tolerant, constituting nearly 92% of all observed animals 5-10 km from the resort. Nearly all animals avoided the zone within 5 km of the resort. There were no significant differences in distribution of lichen heath, hardness of snow, integrated ram hardness index (IRH) values, or snow depths on ridges with increasing distance from the resort. Available biomass of lichens was ca. 1200 g m(-2) 0-5 km from the resort and decreased to a low of ca. 250 g m(-2) at 15-25 km distance, a pattern that probably reflects overgrazing as a result of avoiding the tourist resort. Such avoidance implies reduced forage intake during winter, substantial reduction in available habitat, and lower productivity of the herd. The results suggest that avoidance by wild animals of sources of anthropogenic disturbance may involve long-term impacts, such as reductions in carrying capacity, that are more serious than those expected from direct physiological stress.","avoidance and development and disturbance and EIA and grazing ecology and lichen and reindeer and Rangifer and snow and tourism and BREEDING BIRD POPULATIONS and OIL-FIELD and ENERGY EXPENDITURES and ACTIVITY BUDGETS and CALVING CARIBOU and PRUDHOE BAY and SNOW and DISTURBANCE and NORWAY and ALASKA",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The purpose of the study was to a) provide an overall life cycle assessment (LCA) of these impacts for various future milk and beef production systems in Norway and b) determine how the choice of metrics for climate change affects the results. System boundaries were from cradle to farm gate and the temporal boundary was 2017 with future scenarios for 2040. The actual production and consumption in Norway in 2017 was used as a baseline (BL), and the sustainability of future Norwegian domestic production of milk and beef was assessed through three scenarios for 2040: 1) a trend yield scenario (TrendY) based on an expected increase in milk yield following the present trend, 2) a high yield scenario (HighY) with higher increase in the milk yield per cow per year than the trend, and 3) a low yield scenario (LowY) where the milk yield per cow per year was adjusted for covering the domestic demand for beef solely from dual-purpose production and no domestic specialized beef production. The beef production per dual-purpose cow was kept constant and the remaining domestic demand in scenario 1 and 2 were covered by specialized beef production. Climate change was assessed using both a GWP100 and a GWP* approach. The HighY scenario had the lowest impact on climate change using GWP100, but when taking the different behaviors of short- and long-term climate pollutants into account (GWP*), the ranking of the future scenarios changed and favored LowY. The potential biodiversity loss was lower for the LowY scenario because the proportion of concentrates in the dairy cow ration was decreased due to lower milk yield. Similarly, the feed-food competition was lower (land use ratio < 1) for the LowY. The results of our study suggest that the choice of metric for GWP and time frame highly affects the results and conclusions and strategies for climate smart and sustainable livestock production should therefore be made with caution. © 2023","Biodiversity and Climate change and Dual-purpose dairy and beef and GWP* and Land use ratio and LCA and article and beef and benchmarking and biodiversity and climate and climate change and controlled study and cow and dairy cattle and greenhouse gas and greenhouse gas emission and land use and life cycle assessment and livestock and milk and milk yield and nonhuman and Norway and Metronidazole and Milk Ejection","10.1016/j.livsci.2023.105393","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2023.105393",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Roads, railroads, and power lines have fragmented the original population into 26 separate herds. The reindeer populations are regulated directly according to availability of winter forage. These winter ranges, generally at lower elevations, are however, often subjected to development. Effects of infrastructure and associated human activity on the distribution of wild reindeer during winter were investigated in the Nordfjella mountain region of western Norway. Systematic aerial surveys of the distribution of ca. 2500 reindeer were conducted during late winter 1986-1998. Areas within 2.5 km from power lines were used less than available in 6 of the 8 sampling years, and areas beyond this zone more than expected. Density of reindeer was 79% lower within 2.5 km from power lines compared with background areas, and increased with increasing distance from infrastructure for comparable habitat. Available forage in terms of lichen cover declined 15-30-fold with distance, and was lowest in the undisturbed areas with the highest density of grazing animals. Areas within 5 kni from resorts or from roads and power lines in combination were avoided in all years. Continued construction of roads, power lines and cabin resorts endanger these available winter ranges, and hence the long term survival of the population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this respect, epiphytic lichens have become a focal group in studies of how logging and silvicultural methods can be adjusted to mimic and restore old-growth conditions. We addressed this issue in a retrospective study in the coastal spruce (Picea abies) forest region of central Norway, surveying 31 old forest sites in order to relate a selected group of epiphytic macrolichens (Fuscopannaria ahlneri, Lobaria pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, Nephroma spp., Platismatia norvegica, Pseudocyphellaria crocata, Ramalina thrausta, and Sphaerophorus globosus) to forest stand characteristics and previous logging history. The lichens were associated with brook ravines, F. ahlneri and P. crocata mostly so, being 10 times more abundant in ravine valley bottoms than on adjacent slopes and plateaus. All species used spruce trees as their main substrate, but L. pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, and Nephroma spp. preferred scattered deciduous trees. Ramalina thrausta and S. globosus occurred more frequently on older trees and increased in number with increasing stand age. In ravine valley bottoms lichens tended to increase in number with increasing tree density (due to increased amount of branches), whereas the opposite was the case on slopes and plateaus (due to higher proportion of high-branched trees). All locations had been selectively cut two or more times during the last 100 yr, with a total harvested volume of 31-124% of present-day standing volumes. After controlling for covariation with stand structure, variables describing logging history (harvested volume, number of cuts, minimum standing volume, and years since last cut) did not explain significant parts of the variation in present-day abundance of the selected lichens. The results suggest that moderate selective cuttings may prove an acceptable management option to sustain viable lichen assemblages on private land.","boreal rain forest and central Norway and dendroecology and epiphytic lichens and forest management and logging history and DOUGLAS-FIR FOREST and OLD-GROWTH and PICEA-ABIES and WESTERN OREGON and REMNANT TREES and SWAN VALLEY and BOREAL and DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and MACROLICHENS and Trees","10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0421:ELINCS]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0421:ELINCS]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The distribution, sex, and general age composition of the reindeer were mapped during the 1998 and 1999 calving seasons (n=776 and n=678, respectively) using systematic snowmobile and ski surveys. Mean reindeer density within preferred habitat was 78% lower in the area <4 km from the tourist resort compared to the area >4 km from the resort (1.47 vs. 6.68 reindeer/km(2), respectively). Mean reindeer density by the power line corridor without traffic was 73% lower in the area <4 kin from the power line compared to areas >4 km from the power line for comparable habitat. Areas <4 kin from anthropogenic structures were avoided despite low levels of human traffic and a high proportion of preferred habitat. Within snow-free sites available for grazing, no significant differences occurred in phenological development of cotton-grass (Eriophorum spp.), in live:dead ratio of plant material, or in graminoid biomass with distance to the tourist resort. Almost 74% of all available forage was located within the avoided 0-4-km zones front the resort or the separate power line. Our results suggest that power lines, even without human traffic, may result in substantial reductions in the use of foraging areas. The combined actions of power lines, roads, and cabins may increase potential avoidance, thereby increasing the use of remaining undisturbed grazing grounds. Possible increased competition for high-quality forage may affect lactation, body condition, and, hence. reproductive success in the long term.","avoidance and calving and disturbance and forage and habitat and Norway and power line and Rangifer tarandus and recreation and reindeer and road and tourism and WILD REINDEER and BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES and INDUSTRIAL-DEVELOPMENT and WINTER DISTRIBUTION and CUMULATIVE IMPACTS and TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS and PLANT PHENOLOGY and JET AIRCRAFT and CARIBOU and DISTURBANCE","10.2307/3803040     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/3803040",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

The climate commitments of many countries depend on forests as carbon sinks which must be quantified, monitored, and projected into the future. For projections we need tools to model forest development and perform scenario analyses to assess future carbon sequestration potentials under different management regimes, the expected net present value of such regimes, and possible impacts of climate change. We propose a scenario analysis software tool (GAYA 2.0) that can assist in answering these types of questions using stand level simulations, detailed carbon flow models and an optimizer. This paper has two objectives: (1) to describe GAYA 2.0, and (2) demonstrate its potential in a case study where we analyze the forest carbon balance over a region in Norway based on national forest inventory sample plots. The tool was used to map the optimality front between the carbon benefit and net present value. We observed changes in net present value for different levels of carbon benefit as well as changes in optimal management strategies. We pre-dicted future changes in several forest carbon pools as well as albedo and illustrated the impact of gradual increase in forest productivity (i.e., due to climate warming). Having been updated and modernized from its previous version with increased attention to forest carbon and energy fluxes, GAYA 2.0 is an effective tool that offers multiple opportunities to perform various types of scenario analyses in forest management. © 2023, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

The dominant iron-oxidizing acidophile in all three waters was an Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans-like eubacterium, which shared 98% 16S rDNA identity with the type strain. A strain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was obtained from one of the waters after enrichment in pyrite medium, but this iron oxidizer was below detectable levels in the acidic waters themselves.

We investigated 159 sample sites with different histories of logging activity, in four climatic zones in SE Norway and recorded the fungus on 93 out of 4146 inspected logs in 33 of the 159 sites. The fungus was clearly most frequent on Picea abies (5.8%) but we also found it on five Pinus sylvestris logs (0.4%). The frequency of the species depended highly upon the decay class and diameter of the logs. We never found P. nigrolimitatus on recently dead logs and only once on a weakly decayed log. The frequency increased sharply on moderately decayed logs and even further on very decayed logs. We rarely found the species on small spruce logs, but found it on nearly a quarter of spruce logs in the diameter class >40 cm. P. nigrolimitatus exhibited a clear trend in being more frequent on spruce logs in highly productive sites compared to logs in sites of medium and low productivity. Furthermore, R nigrolimitatus showed a clear trend in being systematically more frequent from young to old-growth forest. When we related the frequency directly to the forest management history, as defined by the coarse woody debris profile, it turned out that the fungus was found on 35% of the suitable logs in the stands that had been unmanaged for several tree generations, while it was found on 4-9% of the suitable logs in managed forests. We found an average frequency reduction of 82% from natural forests to managed forests when we compared similar substrates. This frequency reduction in combination with reduced substrate availability suggests a population decline larger than 95% from the period before widespread logging, several centuries ago, until today.

The 95 % home range size averaged 0.15 km(2). The proportional distribution of habitat categories in the home ranges was compared with that in the landscape; EDGE (forest <30 m from open habitats) and FIELD (mainly pastures and gardens) ranked first, followed by CROP (farmland ploughed annually), OLD (forest >30 m from open habitats) and YOUNG (clear-cuts and young planted forest). The same ranking was found when the habitats used were compared with those available within the home ranges. Crows devoted more time to perching, mostly in EDGE, than to foraging, mostly in FIELD and CROP. Use of EDGE increased with increasing availability of EDGE in the home range, but the crows used EDGE more than expected from availability only as long as the proportion of EDGE was <0.40. Home range decreased as the proportion of EDGE in the home range increased. The results suggest that an increase in the farmland-forest edge-to-area ratio may increase the density of breeding Hooded Crows, and thus increase the predation risk on bird nests in edge habitats.","ARTIFICIAL GROUND NESTS and HABITAT USE and HOME-RANGE and AMERICAN CROWS and PREDATION and BIRDS and FRAGMENTATION and LANDSCAPE and ECOTONES and SIZE",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is the dominating fish species and can, for management purposes, be subdivided in three different morphs: Deep water spawning (D-) whitefish; River spawning (R-) whitefish; and Shallow water spawning (S-) whitefish. These morphs differ in habitat use, growth and life history characteristics and can be separated by differences in gill raker number. Traditionally, European whitefish was exploited with bottom gill nets and beach seine in subsistence fisheries. In 198 1, the start of a commercial fishery with pelagic gill nets increased the exploitation. The yield from this fishery has varied between 6 and 22 tone with declining yield in later years. This decline in yield was caused by a lower effort. CPUE of European whitefish decreased from 4.3 kg/netnight in 1982 to 1.2 kg/ netnight in 1987, but increased to a new peak in 1993, with 3.7 kg/netnight. The variation in overall CPUE closely followed the fluctuations in CPUE for D-whitefish, the most numerous morph in the lake. These fluctuations in CPUE were connected to variations in year class strength for D-whitefish, where recruitment appeared to alternate between stronger and weaker year classes over several years. Fewer variations were observed in the CPUE of R- and S-whitefish. Total annual mortality in adult fish was about 25-40% indicating that the catch mortality was not very high. Length-at-age of juvenile D-whitefish has decreased since the start of the commercial fishery, whereas that of adult fish has not changed much from 1983 to 1994. At the present level of exploitation, the fisheries in Lake Femund seems to be sustainable without strong effects on the density of adult European whitefish.",NA,NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

The stand series comprised unlogged natural forests and forests that were selectively or clear cut 60-70 years prior to our study. Each stand was described with respect to history of forestry impact and tree-stand structure. Environmental, species number, species abundance and species composition (vegetation gradients obtained as ordination axes) variables obtained for 25 m x 1 m plots in each stand were tested for among-stand differences. Significant among-stand differences were found, partly related to former forest management and partly,due to among-stand differences in topography. Differences among stands related,to management were found for tree stand density, highest in managed stands, and for Dryopteris expansa agg. and Luzula pilosa abundances, peaking in formerly clear-cut stands. Species number (at plot or stand scales) was weakly related to former management. On southerly as well as northerly aspects, gradients in species composition were found that separated plots according to former management. Differences among stand conditioned on topography resulted in opposite patterns in the two series of stands because among southerly stands the clear cut was the least while among northerly the clear cut was the most strongly sloping. Low-inclination sites tended more strongly to be paludified and to have high Sphagnum cover, and to have low abundance of specific microsites with small mosses and hepatics. Vegetation gradients related to soil moisture and microtopography were found for both aspects. A strong gradient in species composition related to tree influence at within-stand scales was found, with variation in species number. Existence of such a gradient should provide for significant biotic effects (of short or long duration) of the environmental changes that take place during forest re-growth: (1) the immediate creation of small or large tree-layer gaps by tree felling; and (2) the closing of the tree layer during the regeneration phase. Most notably, the phases at which the tree layer reaches minimum and maximum cover, respectively, may act as 'bottlenecks' for survival of forest-floor species. We conclude that forestry impacts understorey vegetation by way of changes. in tree-layer structure and, to a lesser extent, substrate availability and the local environment, during forest regrowth. The extent and duration of this impact will depend on a complex set of factors. Our results are consistent with the view that if maintenance of species diversity is aimed at, environmental considerations should be built into forest management practices, preferably by mimicking the natural structural dynamics of the tree layer.

"79","rayyan-674262378","Selecting indicator traits for monitoring land use impacts: Birds in northern coastal birch forests","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.","biological diversity and birch forests and birds and indicators and land use change and monitoring land use impacts and Norway and RLQ analysis and species traits and spruce plantations and trait-environment linkages and FLYCATCHER FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA and TIT PARUS-CINCTUS and SPECIES TRAITS and BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY and ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS and FORAGING NICHES and GUILD CONCEPT and COMMUNITIES and BIODIVERSITY and HABITAT and Betula and Trees","10.1890/1051-0761(2003)13[999:SITFML]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2003)13[999:SITFML]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8% of pre-development densities without significant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217% increase in use of the few remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.

Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity. © 2023.

Both species are often considered to be indicators of long-time continuous presence of downed logs in Scandinavian forest stands. Of the stand-level variables, number of logs in late stages of decay was positively related to P. nigrolimitatus presence, while diversity of coarse woody debris was positively related to the abundance of the species. Both the presence and abundance of P. nigrolitnitatus was strongly and positively correlated with the area of forest uninterrupted by major disturbance the past 240 years (equalling 140 years of ""old growth continuity"") in the surrounding landscape (80 ha). For C murraii, consistent results was not found. We conclude that the causal relationships between ecological continuity and possible indicator species must be investigated on a larger scale than the stand-level as the condition of the forest surrounding a stand can have a large influence on these relationships.

Reindeer being provoked by a snow-mobile discovered the observer at longer distances than reindeer being provoked by a skier (370 [skier] vs. 534 [snowmobile] m; P = 0.002), while total flight (756 vs. 570 m; P = 0.037) and total distance moved (970 vs. 660 m; P = 0.008) by reindeer were shorter for snowmobile than skier provocation. The fright (328 [skier] vs. 328 [snowmobile] m), flight (281 vs. 264 m), and escape (543 vs. 486 m) distances due to skier or snowmobile provocation were not different (P > 0.05). For pooled data, fright distances of reindeer were affected by 2 other independent variables. Fright distance was longer when the animals were provoked from below rather than from above (P = 0.046), while their escape distances were longer when the animals were lying rather than when grazing prior to being provoked (P< 0.05). Based on maximum and minimum distance moved for all provocations pooled, daily estimated energy expenditure of reindeer increased between 31 and 590 kJ, representing 0.2 and 2.9% of their estimated total daily energy expenditure. Overall, provocations by skiers or snowmobiles revealed similar behavioral responses. An estimated maximum rate of 3 daily encounters between reindeer and skiers or snowmobiles during winter vacation and Easter would result in moderate energy costs that should be easily compensated for and thus have no demographic consequences. Increasing snowmobile use will, however, significantly expand the area where humans are in contact with reindeer during winter and spring, a period of negative energy balance for reindeer.","anthropogenic disturbance and harassment and Norway and Rangifer tarandus and snowmobile and tourism and winter and WHITE-TAILED DEER and RANGIFER-TARANDUS-PLATYRHYNCHUS and BARREN-GROUND CARIBOU and HEART-RATE and DISTURBANCE and SVALBARD","10.2307/3802681     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/3802681",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

We used cover-biomass regressions to assess the relationship between lichen cover and biomass. In 2 of the regions, lichen biomass was 5.3 times and 2.8 times higher in areas isolated by 2 parallel power lines and an adjacent winter-closed road compared to biomass on the other side of the potential barrier. In a third region, lichen biomass did not vary significantly between areas on either side of a single ""inter-closed road. Lichen biomass data suggested that wild reindeer used both sides of a closed road in winter, whereas 2 parallel power lines and a winter-closed road in combination reduced reindeer migration and resulted in very different grazing pressures on either side of the power lines, even 30 years after the power lines were constructed. Construction of power lines, and particularly parallel power lines, should thus be avoided in wild reindeer habitat.

Floristic data (189 taxa) were collected in 130 4-m(2) sample plots within 12 summer farms in Roldal, western Norway. The study was designed to sample as fully as possible the range of floristic, environmental, and land-use conditions. Vegetation types delimited by two-way indicator species analysis were consistent with results from earlier phytosociological studies. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis show that rather than being distinct vegetation types, the major floristic variation is structured along a spatial gradient from summer farm to the surrounding heathland vegetation. Species richness (alpha diversity) was modelled against environmental variables by generalized linear modelling and compositional turnover (beta diversity) by canonical correspondence analysis. Most environmental factors made significant contributions, but the spatial distance-to-farm gradient was the best predictor of both species richness and turnover. While summer farms reduce mean species richness at the plot scale, the compositional heterogeneity of the upland landscapes is increased, thereby creating `ecological room' for additional vegetation types and species. Within an overall similarity across scales, soil variables (pH, base saturation, LOI, phosphate and nitrogen) differed considerably in their explanatory power for richness and turnover. A difference between `productivity limiting' factors and `environmental sieves' is proposed as an explanation.

A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.","dispersal and Emberiza hortulana and endangered species and golf and Norway and ortolan bunting and population dynamics and TURF APPLICATION and DIAZINON AG500 and URBAN GRADIENT and LAND-USE and WILDLIFE and DIVERSITY and FARMLAND and GEESE and Population Dynamics","10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0719:EOAGCO]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0719:EOAGCO]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Both field margin types were adjacent to intensively managed grass or cereal fields. Effects of eight variables on field margin vegetation were studied. Despite having many plant species in common, composition and species number differed between the two field margin types, due to different ecological conditions and margin management. Arable field margins were composed of tall and/or nutrient demanding ubiquitous species and were characterised by species of later successional stages than those of road verges. The vegetation of road verges was lower and species numbers were higher than in arable field margins. The road verges contained several semi-natural meadow species that are declining in abundance. A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded variables showed that plant species composition was significantly affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent to fields with mainly cereal crops. In order to preserve botanical diversity in this agricultural landscape, the maintenance of regularly mown road verges should be prioritized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To develop effective conservation strategies towards such pressures we need to improve our understanding of how species richness and community composition are shaped by species' responses to landscape patterns. In this study we tested relationships between patch size and isolation, species richness and species traits in a fragmented landscape of calcareous grasslands-a diversity hotspot in Southern Norway. We recorded a total of 381 vascular plant species, of which 50 are considered habitat specialists, distributed among 86 habitat patches (50-9,475 m(2)) in 22 of 50 randomly sampled 500 x 500 m-plots. We found that large habitat patches held more species of both generalists and specialists than small habitat patches and that well-connected patches held more specialist species than isolated patches. About 1/3 of the habitat specialists in this study system showed vulnerability to isolation, i.e. lower probability of occurrence in isolated patches. Traits related both to persistence (short lifespan) and colonization ability (low seed production per plant) were predictors of vulnerability to isolation. Our results indicate that both colonization and extinction processes affect species composition and richness, and that the rescue-effect-mitigation of local, area-dependent extinctions through colonization-is reduced in isolated patches. These findings suggest that conservation strategies should place greater emphasis on the spatial configuration of the habitat network, and on the preservation of colonization processes to ensure regional persistence of species.","Connectivity conservation and Fragmentation and Functional traits and Life-history and Plant diversity and Species-area effect and LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS and LAND-USE CHANGE and HABITAT LOSS and METAPOPULATION PERSISTENCE and CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS and CRITICAL THRESHOLDS and EXTINCTION DEBT and RICHNESS and POPULATIONS and DISPERSAL","10.1007/s10531-014-0835-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-014-0835-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In 2002 about one half of the study area was intensively managed for agricultural purposes, 19.3% was woodland and 14.4% was semi-natural grassland. The main vegetation gradient in the area reflected long-term management (land-use) intensity. Both species richness and habitat specificity decreased with increasing management intensity. Semi-natural grassland species occurred throughout the landscape, although with some concentration to semi-natural grasslands. The two measures of habitat specificity both peaked in semi-natural grasslands. Comparison of the present patterns of vascular plant distributions with information on past land-use derived from a map from 1865, indicate that species typical of semi-natural grasslands persist long after land use activities have come to an end and that there is an extinction debt in the vascular flora. The significant positive relationship between patches with high richness of species typical of semi-natural grasslands, remnant semi-natural grassland patches and man-made structures with long continuity, shows that restoring formerly open semi-natural grassland 'hot spots' in a agricultural landscapes is advantageous both for conservation of cultural and biological values.

Natural old Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. forests have been replaced increasingly by dense, even-aged plantations. This study aims at increasing our knowledge about populations of old forest associated lichens in P. abies plantations. In differently aged plantations, we measured occurrence of six lichen species and the population size and reproductive effort of :five lichen species. We found that the success of colonizing plantations differed because of species-specific constraints and needs, and that species occurrence depended on stand age and branch quality. A high number of reproducing thalli and small juvenile thalli of the cyanolichen Lobaria scrobiculata (Scop.) DC. and the pendulous lichen Ramalina thrausta (Ach.) Nyl. suggest effective recruitment within plantations. The populations of the cyanolichens Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. and Pseudocphellaria crocata (L.) Vain, were too small to be viable and demand special concern to survive in managed forests. The abundance of old forest associated lichens in a managed boreal rainforest could be promoted by a varied and heterogeneous branch structure, increased rotation periods (increase the value of plantations as propagule sources), small clearcuts and retention trees (shorten the distance between sources of propagules and target substrate), and maintaining Salix and Sorbus trees (important host trees for cyanolichens and thereby important dispersal sources).","LOBARIA-PULMONARIA and POPULUS-TREMULA and SPRUCE FOREST and DISPERSAL and GROWTH and LANDSCAPES and BIOMASS and METAPOPULATION and COLONIZATION and GRADIENTS and Norway","10.1139/X11-091     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/X11-091",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

These changes have been predicted to impact the distribution and abundance of wildlife species relying on willow thickets as habitat. We assessed the relation between variables quantifying willow thicket configuration and population dynamics of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in three riparian regions in Finnmark, northern Norway, which were subject to intense browsing by semi-domesticated reindeer. The tundra vole, which exhibits 5-year population cycles in Finnmark, is the dominant small rodent species in riparian landscape elements in southern arctic tundra. In the course of a 4-year trapping study, tundra vole populations went through the cyclic phases of increase, peak and crash, however, with distinct differences between the three regions in the population dynamics. Within regions, the occupancy pattern during the increase phase was positively related to willow thicket configuration (in particular edge density and willow height) only in the region attaining the highest abundance and occupancy. However, local abundance was not clearly related to habitat features within any regions. The lack of consistency in the response of tundra vole populations to willow thicket configuration, as well as the positive relation between the degree of thicket shredding and tundra vole habitat occupancy in one of the regions, indicates that tundra voles will not be much affected by climate or browsing induced changes in the shrubbiness of the tundra in the future.","Over-browsing and Shrub expansion and Fragmentation and Abundance and Occupancy and Large-scale study and SPACE-USE RESPONSES and MICROTUS-OECONOMUS and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and SHRUB EXPANSION and REINDEER and HERBIVORES and LEMMINGS and FOREST and VEGETATION and ECOSYSTEM","10.1007/s00300-010-0908-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-010-0908-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Our basic hypothesis is that human influence in the Anthropocene is ubiquitous, and we predict that biodiversity hot spot modeling can be improved by addressing three challenges raised by the increasing ecological influence of humans: (i) anthropogenically modified responses to individual ecological factors, (ii) fundamentally different processes and predictors in landscape types shaped by different land use histories and (iii) a multitude and complexity of natural and anthropogenic processes that may require many predictors and even multiple models in different landscape types. We modeled the occurrence of veteran oaks in Norway, and found, in accordance with our basic hypothesis and predictions, that humans influence the distribution of veteran oaks throughout its range, but in different ways in forests and open landscapes. In forests, geographical and topographic variables related to the oak niche are still important, but the occurrence of veteran oaks is shifted toward steeper slopes, where logging is difficult. In open landscapes, land cover variables are more important, and veteran oaks are more common toward the north than expected from the fundamental oak niche. In both landscape types, multiple predictor variables representing ecological and human-influenced processes were needed to build a good model, and several models performed almost equally well. Models accounting for the different anthropogenic influences on landscape structure and processes consistently performed better than models based exclusively on natural biogeographical and ecological predictors. Thus, our results for veteran oaks clearly illustrate the challenges to distribution modeling raised by the ubiquitous influence of humans, even in a moderately populated region, but also show that predictions can be improved by explicitly addressing these anthropogenic complexities.","forest and hollow oaks and land use change and landscape structure and large trees and presence-absence and Quercus petraea and Quercus robur and species distribution modeling and REGRESSION-MODELS and KEY HABITATS and LAND-USE and CONSERVATION and DIVERSITY and HYPOTHESIS and SPACE and AREAS and Veterans","10.1002/ece3.3305     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3305",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Veteran oaks (biodiversity hotspot habitat)","Observational studies"

Drift samples were compared to examine if drift densities, and thus drift prey availabilities for juvenile salmon, were lower in the ice-free than the ice-covered area. In addition, juvenile salmon stomach contents were compared to benthos and drift in the ice-free area to examine salmon winter feeding habitat. Zooplankton, originating from the reservoir, dominated drift at the ice-free site but had lower densities at the downstream ice-covered site. Excluding zooplankton, Chironomidae comprised most of the remaining drift at both the ice-free and ice-covered site, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Simuliidae. No Trichoptera were found in the drift samples. There was no consistent diel periodicity in drift. Benthos was dominated by Chironomidae, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Other invertebrates occurred in low numbers. Juvenile salmon demonstrated size-selective feeding and fed mainly on Ephemeroptera, followed by Trichoptera and Plecoptera. No zooplankton and few Chironomidae were found in the stomach samples. Stomach content was more similar to benthos than to drift, indicating a larger extent of benthic than drift feeding. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that lack of ice cover reduced the invertebrate drift or caused diel periodicity in the drift. Differences in drift between areas with and without ice could not account for the observed differences in mortality of juvenile salmon during the winter in these areas.","Benthos and Invertebrate drift and Prey size and Regulated river and Salmo salar and Stomach contents and STREAM INVERTEBRATES and DRIFT PATTERNS and SALAR L and PARR and FOOD and PERIODICITY and BEHAVIOR and DENSITY and TROUT and ALTA","10.1007/s10750-010-0118-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0118-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Despite the importance of the boreal forest biome in global carbon cycling, the impacts of moose have only been studied in disparate regional exclosure experiments, leading to calls for common analyses across a biome-wide network of moose exclosures.In this study, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) to analyse forest canopy responses to moose across 100 paired exclosure-control experimental plots distributed across the boreal biome, including sites in the United States (Isle Royale), Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland), Norway, Sweden and Finland.We test the hypotheses that canopy height, vertical complexity and above-ground biomass (AGB) are all reduced by moose and that the impacts vary with moose density, productivity, temperature and pulse disturbances such as logging and insect outbreaks.We find a surprising convergence in forest canopy response to moose. Moose had negative impacts on canopy height, complexity and AGB as expected. The responses of canopy complexity and AGB were consistent across regions and did not vary along environmental gradients. The difference in canopy height between exclosures and open plots was on average 6 cm per year since the start of exclosure treatment (+/- 2.1 SD). This rate increased with temperature, but only when moose density was high.The difference in AGB between moose exclosures and open plots was 0.306 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (+/- 0.079). In browsed plots, stand AGB was 32% of that in the exclosures, a difference of 2.09 Mg ha(-1).

"109","rayyan-674230321","Light and temperature controls of aquatic plant photosynthesis downstream of a hydropower plant and the effect of plant removal","Science of the Total Environment","Many rivers worldwide are regulated, and the altered hydrology can lead to mass development of aquatic plants. Plant invasions are often seen as a nuisance for human activities leading to costly remedial actions with uncertain implications for aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Mechanical harvesting is often used to remove aquatic plants and knowledge of plant growth rate could improve management decisions. Here, we used a simple light-temperature theoretical model to make a priori prediction of aquatic plant photosynthesis. These predictions were assessed through an open-channel diel change in O2 mass balance approach. A Michaelis-Menten type model was fitted to observed gross primary production (GPP) standardised at 10 °C using a temperature dependence from thermodynamic theory of enzyme kinetics. The model explained 87 % of the variability in GPP of a submerged aquatic plant (Juncus bulbosus L.) throughout an annual cycle in the River Otra, Norway. The annual net plant production was about 2.4 (1.0–3.8) times the standing biomass of J. bulbosus. This suggests a high continuous mass loss due to hydraulic stress and natural mechanical breakage of stems, as the biomass of J. bulbosus remained relatively constant throughout the year. J. bulbosus was predicted to be resilient to mechanical harvesting with photosynthetic capacity recovered within two years following 50–85 % plant removal. The predicted recovery was confirmed through a field experiment where 72 % of J. bulbosus biomass was mechanically removed. We emphasise the value of using a theoretical approach, like metabolic theory, over statistical models where a posteriori results are not always easy to interpret. Finally, the ability to predict ecosystem resilience of aquatic photosynthesis in response to varying management scenarios offers a valuable tool for estimating aquatic ecosystem services, such as carbon regulation. This tool can benefit the EU Biodiversity Strategy and UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 The Authors","Light and Macrophyte removal and Metabolic theory and Photosynthesis and Regulated river and Resilience and Temperature and Biodiversity and Biomass and Ecosystem and Humans and Aquatic ecosystems and Enzyme kinetics and Forecasting and Metabolism and Rivers and Aquatic plants and Down-stream and Gross primary production and Hydropower plants and Macrophytes and Mechanical and aquatic plant and light and macrophyte and photosynthesis and resilience and Sustainable Development Goal and temperature effect and aquatic environment and aquatic species and Article and controlled study and ecosystem resilience and environmental exposure and environmental impact and environmental management and enzyme kinetics and harvesting and hydropower and Juncus and Juncus bulbosus and nonhuman and plant removal and primary production (biomass) and temperature dependence and temperature sensitivity and water analysis and water quality and water temperature and biodiversity and biomass and ecosystem and human and physiology and temperature","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169201","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169201",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Quasi-observational studies"
"110","rayyan-674231592","Future wood demands and ecosystem services trade-offs: A policy analysis in Norway","Forest Policy and Economics","To mitigate climate change, several European countries have launched policies to promote the development of a renewable resource-based bioeconomy. These bioeconomy strategies plan to use renewable biological resources, which will increase timber and biomass demands and will potentially conflict with multiple other ecosystem services provided by forests. In addition, these forest ecosystem services (FES) are also influenced by other, different, policy strategies, causing a potential mismatch in proposed management solutions for achieving the different policy goals. We evaluated how Norwegian forests can meet the projected wood and biomass demands from the international market for achieving mitigation targets and at the same time meet nationally determined targets for other FES. Using data from the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) we simulated the development of Norwegian forests under different management regimes and defined different forest policy scenarios, according to the most relevant forest policies in Norway: national forest policy (NFS), biodiversity policy (BIOS), and bioeconomy policy (BIES). Finally, through multi-objective optimization, we identified the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario. The results for all scenarios indicated that Norway will be able to satisfy wood demands of up to 17 million m3 in 2093. However, the policy objectives for FES under each scenario caused substantial differences in terms of the management regimes selected. We observed that BIES and NFS resulted in very similar forest management programs in Norway, with a dominance of extensive management regimes. In BIOS there was an increase of set aside areas and continuous cover forestry, which made it more compatible with biodiversity indicators. We also found multiple synergies and trade-offs between the FES, likely influenced by the definition of the policy targets at the national scale. © 2022","Ecosystem services and Forest management and Forest policy and Multi-objective optimization and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Foreign Trade and Forest Management and Forestry and Norway and Norwegian and Wood and Climate change and Economic and social effects and International trade and Timber and Forest ecosystem and Management regime and Multi-objectives optimization and National forests and Policy analysis and Policy scenario and Trade off and Wood demand and Multiobjective optimization","10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102899","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102899",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line","Conceptual work / scenarios"

An effective measure to increase wild bee diversity is to enhance plant diversity. However, the effect on bee diversity of augmenting plant diversity depends on site-specific environmental conditions. We aimed to make spatial predictions of where: (a) environmental conditions maximize bee diversity, so that such areas can be prioritized for augmenting plant diversity; and (b) populations of threatened wild bee species are most likely to occur. We surveyed bee communities in traditionally managed hay meadows in SE Norway and modelled bee diversity as a function of climate, habitat area, and distance to nesting substrates. We used independent data to validate our predictions and found that plant and predicted bee species richness together explained 76% and 69% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness in forested and agricultural ecosystems, respectively. In urban areas, the predicted bee species richness alone explained 31% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness. Using data from online species occurrence records, we found that – compared to species of lower conservation concern – threatened solitary bee species were more typically recorded in areas with a high predicted solitary bee species richness. We show that spatial predictions of bee diversity can identify sites where augmenting plant diversity is likely to be most effective. Maps of predicted bee diversity can guide species surveys and monitoring projects and increase the chances of locating populations of threatened bees. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biodiversity conservation and Habitat management and Pollinators and Spatial predictions and Wild bees and Norway and bee and species conservation and species diversity and species richness and wild population","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104267","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104267",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Spatially explicit model prediction of species richness"

The uncertainty in the future carbon balance associated with the choice of a climate change scenario is assessed by forcing LPJ-DGVM with output from four different climate models (GCMs: CGCM2, CSIRO2, HadCM3, PCM2) for the same SRES storyline. Decrease in agricultural areas and afforestation leads to simulated carbon sequestration for all land-use change scenarios with an average net uptake of 17-38 Tg C/year between 1990 and 2100, corresponding to 1.9-2.9% of the EU*s CO2 emissions over the same period. Soil carbon losses resulting from climate warming reduce or even offset carbon sequestration resulting from growth enhancement induced by climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the second half of the twenty-first century. Differences in future climate change projections among GCMs are the main cause for uncertainty in the cumulative European terrestrial carbon uptake of 4.4-10.1 Pg C between 1990 and 2100.","terrestrial carbon balance and climate change and land-use change and SRES-scenarios and LPJ-DGVM and MINERAL SOIL CARBON and ORGANIC-MATTER and ELEVATED CO2 and MODEL and VEGETATION and ECOSYSTEMS and BIOSPHERE and DECOMPOSITION and TEMPERATURE and SCENARIOS and Europe","10.1007/s10021-007-9028-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-007-9028-9",NA,NA,"EU + Norway and Switzerland","Not specified","Conceptual work / scenarios"

In 100 circular study plots of 100 ha each we recorded 38 white- backed - Dendrocopos leucotos, 22 grey- headed - Picus canus, 13 great spotted - Dendrocopos major, 6 green - Picus viridis, and 2 lesser spotted - Dendrocopos minor woodpeckers in the breeding season. The mean number of recorded woodpecker species peaked at 20 - 40% spruce plantations. The two most common species in the study, the white- backed and the grey- headed woodpeckers are both Red-listed species in Norway and among the rarest woodpeckers in Europe. The white- backed woodpecker preferred plots with higher than average proportions of standing dead trees and deciduous trees, and low proportions of spruce plantations in the plots. The grey-headed woodpecker preferred plots in the western ( coastal) parts of the study area with presence of large aspen Populus tremula trees. Logistic regression models did not reveal any clear threshold values with respect to proportion of spruce plantations in plots, although both woodpecker species were extremely rare in plots with > 60% spruce plantations. We recommend spruce plantations to be kept at moderate levels to ensure viable populations of woodpeckers in western Norway.","coastal pine forest and critical thresholds and Dendrocopos leucotos and Norway and Picus canus and spruce plantations and woodpeckers and DENDROCOPOS-LEUCOTOS and LANDSCAPE and POPULATION and BOREAL and FOOD and Trees","10.1007/s10531-004-6065-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-6065-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

In Norway, some 2.2 million sheep graze on outlying pastures during summer, most of them in the alpine zone, but no study has reported the relative impact of sheep grazing on invertebrate communities relative to other environmental factors such as the plant community and altitude. A fully replicated landscape-scale experiment (2.7 km(2)) was performed with no, low (25 per km(2)) and high (80 per km(2)) sheep densities in an alpine habitat of Norway (1050-1300 in a.s.l.). The increased vulnerability hypothesis (HI) predicts that the more folivorous invertebrates, the higher the grazing pressure by sheep, as large herbivore grazing may stress the plants so they are more vulnerable to insect herbivory. The increased defence hypothesis (H-2) predicts increased levels of general anti-herbivore defences, and thus a lower abundance of invertebrates with increasing sheep densities. Contrary to both predictions, no evidence was found that sheep grazing affected invertebrate richness, or abundance of folivorous, predatory or detritivore invertebrates - in a community dominated by Diptera and Hemiptera. Demonstrating an effect will always be a function of sample size, but at least our study shows that other environmental variables (such as plant species richness and functional plant richness) are more important determinants than sheep grazing for the selected invertebrate groups. Our study was short-term (first year of grazing) mainly designed to test specific hypotheses related to induced plant defences; long-term effects are probably owing to the impact sheep may have on vegetation composition, primary production, litter cover and soil properties.","sheep and grazing and Diptera and Hemiptera and alpine ecosystem and TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and INSECT DIVERSITY and DEER and BIODIVERSITY and ASSEMBLAGES and RESPONSES and VARIABILITY and POPULATIONS and ARTHROPODS","10.1017/S0952836905007107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0952836905007107",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Harvest management requires knowledge of whether the harvest is sustainable as a result of compensatory mechanisms, such as dispersal. The effect of recreational harvesting on dispersal patterns in willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus was assessed over four hunting seasons in central Norway. 2. A two-parameter Weibull model was fitted to the observed absolute dispersal distance data using maximum likelihood methods. Estimates of the scale and shape parameters for the dispersal probability distribution were calculated, describing the distribution of observed willow ptarmigan dispersal distances. From the parameter estimates of the dispersal model we estimated the standard deviation of the dispersal displacement relevant for population genetic and spatial population dynamic models. 3. The effect of harvesting on dispersal patterns was examined by testing for differences in the scale and shape parameters of dispersal distance distributions in areas with and without harvest. No effect of harvesting was found, either in adults or juveniles. 4. Breeding dispersal of adult birds was estimated as a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 402 m and shape parameter b = 2.01, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation of sigma = 284 m. The dispersal probability distribution of adults was not significantly different from a bivariate normal distribution. 5. Natal dispersal had a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 4206 m and shape parameter b = 1.16, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation sigma = 3728 m. The dispersal probability distribution of juveniles was not significantly different from an exponential distribution. 6. Synthesis and applications. Reduction of the population density of willow ptarmigan through harvesting at moderate densities does not seem to affect the dispersal distances. Thus, if there is little or no difference in the dispersal probability distribution in harvested and non-harvested areas there will be only weak or no compensation for the harvest, given that natural mortality and reproduction is the same in both areas. Thus, erroneously assuming compensation of harvest by immigration into a local population can lead to overharvest.",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01031.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01031.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

To reveal the importance of different prey species in forest versus farmland landscapes, we video recorded 146 prey deliveries at four nests in a farmland-dominated area and three nests in a forest-dominated area in south-eastern Norway in June 2005. Thrushes and corvids were the dominating prey in both areas. We found higher diet diversity in the forest-dominated landscape, but we also found high dietary overlap, presumably due to the dominance of thrushes in both areas. Prey composition of forest versus farmland species differed significantly between the areas, mainly due to a higher proportion of corvids and a lower proportion of grouse in the farmland-dominated area. Goshawk diet thus reflects the habitats within the nesting territory.","BREEDING-SEASON DIET and ACCIPITER-GENTILIS and PREY and HABITAT and FRAGMENTATION and AVAILABILITY and PREDATION and WINTER",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Our aim was to identify whether forest disturbance history was an important factor controlling the variation in average plant performance. We used three measures of forest maturity (maturity class, tree biomass and number of trees) as variables reflecting disturbance history. These variables were used in our analysis together with measured environmental conditions (soil moisture, pH, nitrogen, and elevation) a priori known to affect plant performance. To quantify plant performance, we used multiple measures of the local V. myrtillus populations, including percentage cover, average ramet age, height, diameter, biomass, growth, and sexual reproduction (number of fruits and number of mature seeds per fruit). Most of the explained variation in our performance variables could be related to our environmental variables, but disturbance history was also an important determinant of the performance of V. myrtillus. All performance variables were higher in younger, less mature stands, except ramet age, which was highest in mature stands. The increase in performance after clear cutting indicates that this period is of high importance for the population dynamics and persistence of V. myrtillus in intensively managed boreal forest landscapes.

Therefore, hydropower electricity production can contribute to combat climate change challenges. However, hydropower electricity production may at the same time contribute to environmental impacts and has been characterized as a large water consumer with impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Life Cycle Assessment is not yet able to assess the biodiversity impact of water consumption from hydropower electricity production on a global scale. The first step to assess these biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment is to quantify the water consumption per kWh energy produced. We calculated catchment-specific net water consumption values for Norway ranging between 0 and 0.012 m(3)/kWh. Further, we developed the first characterization factors for quantifying the aquatic biodiversity impacts of water consumption in a post-glaciated region. We apply our approach to quantify the biodiversity impact per kWh Norwegian hydropower electricity.

The aim of this study was to find how the macrophyte Juncus bulbosus Linnaeus affects salmonids and benthic macroinvertebrates in Norwegian rivers. The proliferation of J. bulbosus in the study rivers commenced after the development of hydropower in the 1960s and 1970s. J. bulbosus is now considered a nuisance for humans in many areas of the rivers. We found a higher density of juvenile fish and higher density, weight and species richness of invertebrates in areas with J. bulbosus than in areas with gravel, suggesting that the vegetation is not limiting fish and invertebrates. This may be because macrophytes increase the surface area and provide shelter, food and a variety of ecological niches. Adult salmonid fish can be negatively affected when their spawning grounds are covered by vegetation. However, overgrowth is not common and may take years since fish clear the river bed of macrophytes during redd digging, indicating competition between macrophytes and fish for riverbed habitat. Our results suggest that one should not assume that outgrowths of macrophytes have negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is important to map all impacts and distinguish nuisance to humans from effects on the ecosystem. © 2020, The Author(s).","Benthic invertebrates and Ecosystem services and Freshwater management and Hydropower and Juncus bulbosus and Salmonids and Norway and Invertebrata and Salmonidae and freshwater ecosystem and invertebrate and macroinvertebrate and macrophyte and river basin and river bed and salmonid and species richness and submerged vegetation and Vegetables","10.1007/s10750-020-04465-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04465-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

These mosaics of mires and wind exposed patches have ericaceous shrub dominated vegetation, and soils within coastal heathlands are characterized by low pH and high levels of recalcitrant debris. Using a culture-based approach with molecular identification of isolates, we characterized root-associated fungal communities of six ericaceous species in eight heathland localities along Norway’s western coast. Site-level alpha diversity ranged from 21-38 OTUs, while the total estimated gamma diversity for culturable heathland root fungi was 190-231 OTUs. Most species recovered are previously reported at low abundance in Norway, suggesting the biodiversity in this community is underreported, rather than novel for science. The fungi recovered were primarily Ascomycota, specifically endophytic Phialocephala, and Pezicula, and no host specificity was observed in the communities. The fungal communities exhibited high turnover and low nestedness, both between ericaceous hosts and across heathland sites. We observed no spatial patterns in fungal betadiversity, and this heterogeneity may be a product of the unique historic land use practices at each locality creating a distinct mycofloral “fingerprint”. Robust diversity estimates will be key for managing fungal biodiversity in coastal heathlands. Our results indicate that sampling schemes that maximize the number of host plants sampled per site, rather than the number of cultures per plant yield improved alpha diversity estimates. Similarly, gamma diversity estimates are improved by maximizing the total number of localities sampled, rather than increasing the number of plants sampled per locality. We argue that while the current protected status of coastal heathland habitats and restoration efforts have knock-on effects for the conservation of fungal biodiversity, fungi have a vital functional role in the ecosystem and holistic conservation plans that consider fungal biodiversity would be beneficial.

These effects are challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation affects habitat selection at the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We fitted resource selection functions at the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation. Scale-dependent responses and temporal adjustments in habitat use may facilitate coexistence between humans and large carnivores.","Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.1038/s41598-022-08468-7","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08468-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location: Highways in southeast Norway. Methods: We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results: Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions: It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success. © 2022 The Authors.

However, trees may also have a negative effect on fodder production. Such trade-offs between productivity and sustainability in farming are poorly understood, especially in high-latitude areas. We studied hay production in two sites in the same wooded meadow in western Norway, one restored 6 years earlier than the other, to examine whether there were differences in hay production over a 4-year pollarding cycle. We measured production in transects starting from the trunks of pollarded and non-pollarded (reference) trees and running out into open meadow, and transects entirely in open meadow. We examined whether pollarding influenced hay production, and whether hay production was related to the distance from the tree trunk. Total production differed between the two sites, indicating that both time since restoration and differences in overall tree influence affected hay production. We observed a strong and immediate pollarding effect (increase in hay production) due to reduced tree influence. Trees have a negative influence on production as demonstrated by the increase in hay production with increasing distance from the tree trunk. However, additional dry fodder produced by harvesting leaves from pollarded trees more than compensates for reduction in hay production under pollarded trees. Moreover, the understorey production in the wooded hay meadow is at the same level as fertilized meadows in Norway when we include the fodder consumed by sheep during spring and autumn grazing. A wooded hay meadow is an environmentally friendly production system that does not compromise food production. Its tree component can also play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and supports higher biodiversity than industrial food production systems. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Canopy cover and Management and Plant-plant interactions and Pollarding and Production and Tree-influence and Norway and agricultural production and agroforestry and alternative agriculture and biodiversity and climate change and farming system and food production and meadow and sustainability and trade-off and understory","10.1007/s10457-020-00570-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-020-00570-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"
"135","rayyan-674265570","What shapes Eurasian lynx distribution in human dominated landscapes: selecting prey or avoiding people?","ECOGRAPHY","In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey - the roe deer - and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (1997-2006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.","HOME-RANGE SIZE and HUMAN DENSITIES and MANAGEMENT and PREDATORS and CONSERVATION and SUITABILITY and POPULATION and NORWAY and POLICY and RULES","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05712.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05712.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Gradients in species composition, found separately for aquatic and terrestrial species by parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations, were interpreted by correlation and geostatistical analyses. The main gradients in species composition given by the first DCA ordination axes for aquatic and terrestrial species were strongly correlated, and both were related to water chemical and geographical variables. The second gradient in aquatic species composition was only weakly related to explanatory variables while for terrestrial species the second axis (like the first) was related to geographical, water chemical and some anthropological impact variables. The spatial structure of most explanatory variables was relatively weak, with a range of influence of 3-6 km. Species composition gradients and species richness variation of the investigated ponds and pond margins were thus to a large extent explained by the same variables. Like species richness, species composition was relatively weakly related to recorded explanatory variables. These two main characteristics of the investigated ecosystem thus both underpin the view that apparent randomness is important in this ecosystem and that ponds and their adjacent margins represent islands in the agricultural landscape that accumulate species more or less individualistically.

However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50−100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at lownor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today.","Norway and Trees","10.14214/sf.479","https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.479",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

We monitored 10 radio-collared lynx in central Norway in two seasons that differed in ungulate distribution and density. According to the 'optimal foraging theory' an animal should preferentially utilise areas with more abundant food if not constrained by other factors; therefore we predicted that lynx should select patches containing livestock. Contrary to our prediction the results indicate no selection for livestock patches in any season. In contrast, a clear preference was shown for roe deer patches in both seasons. Our findings support the hypothesis that lynx depredation on livestock seems to be affected by chance encounter rates, rather than by active selection for livestock-dense patches.

Roe deer, the major food source of lynx in the study area, occurred at higher densities closer to areas of human activity and infrastructure. Proximity of lynx locations to human activity and infrastructure was used as a risk index because the most common causes of death among Scandinavian lynx were of anthropogenic origin. This study shows that distances from lynx locations to human activity were significantly greater for females with newborn kittens than for males, but this decreased with kitten age. The data suggest that this response to human activity is influenced by the reproductive strategies of males and females, and might explain male-biased human-induced mortality in this study and in carnivores more generally.","Eurasian lynx and risk taking and human-dominated landscape and reproductive status and attractive sinks and CARNIVORES and NORWAY and POPULATIONS and SPAIN and Humanities and Humanism and Humans and Risk-Taking","10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00107.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00107.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Nowadays wolverines in Scandinavia are found in remote high alpine areas, and we investigated whether human development through presence of infrastructure has relegated them to these areas. We analysed wolverine habitat selection and the impact of infrastructure in two study areas in Norway using compositional analysis. We found that alpine tundra with low human development was important for wolverines to locate their home ranges. Human development formed a more important factor for home range location than did habitat, because habitat selectivity was much higher in undeveloped habitats than in developed habitats. Within their home ranges, wolverines used alpine shrubland and forest, irrespective of human development. The sympatric distribution of wolverines with wild and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus indicates that wolverines are vulnerable to indirect loss of habitat. However, we hypothesise that wolverine distribution may be partly influenced by direct disturbance or higher risk of human-caused mortality associated with infrastructure. Increased human development and activity in once remote areas may thus cause reduced ability of wolverines to perform their daily activities unimpeded, making the habitat less optimal or causing wolverines to avoid the disturbed area. Our results suggest that the potential exists for further wolverine recovery in forest ecosystems with low levels of infrastructural development.","compositional analysis and Gulo gulo and habitat use and home range location and human development and infrastructure and Norway and wolverine and HOME-RANGE and REINDEER and CARIBOU and ROADS","10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[285:IOIOHS]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[285:IOIOHS]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway, possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world. The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators, large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem productivity in high-density districts.","Alpine and arctic tundra and plant abundance and flower abundance and functional groups and density-dependence and exploitation ecosystems and ecosystem state and herbivore overabundance and grazing and ungulate management and LITTER DECOMPOSITION and NITROGEN DYNAMICS and MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES and VEGETATION CHANGES and COMMUNITY ECOLOGY and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and REINDEER and TUNDRA and CARIBOU and RESPONSES","10.1007/s10021-007-9058-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-007-9058-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

The abundance of total Acari, total Oribatida, Oribatida adults and juveniles differed significantly between OM-F1, OM-RM, OM-F2 and RM-F2 sites and it was significantly correlated with continuity of land use and/or tree cover. Oribatida was the group with the highest densities and percentage dominance (except RM site). The percent contribution of total Oribatida in Acari abundance was negatively correlated with the percentage of Actinedida. Nine Ptyctimina species, six Nothroidea species and four Uropodina species were detected, but most of them occurred as single individuals. Abundance of three Ptyctimina [Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus (C.L. Koch), Phthiracarus ferrugineus (C.L. Koch), P globosus (C.L. Koch)], and two Uropodina [Trachytes pauperior Berlese and Dinychus perforatus Kramer] species differed significantly between some sites. The percentage similarity (Renkonen index) has a high indicative value for measuring the distance between ecosystems with apparently similar communities of Uropodina. The OM and RM sites differed most and site pairs - F1-F2 and F1-RM were the most similar. The densities of some taxa were about two-or three-fold greater for the F1site than the RM site. Ratios of Acari to Collembola, total Oribatida to Collembola and total Oribatida to Actinedida were highest on OM site (3.2, 2.6, 11.8 respectively) and decreased in the following order: F2>F1>RM (as an example, total Oribatida to Actinedida ratios were 9.8 on F2 site, 6.2 on F1 and 3.1. on RM). These ratios differed significantly between the OM and RM sites. The lowest ratios on RM site are probably an effect of recent disturbance (change of land use) of this site. Our results suggest that soil in OM site, despite constant disturbance during long time (scything, hay raking and sheep grazing), has probably a stable mesofauna community with the highest abundance of Oribatida. Our results have provided new knowledge about ecosystems in traditional farmland and can be used in monitoring programmes of post-arable land.","mites and land use and soil monitoring and extensive management and SPECIES COMPOSITION and ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION and ORIBATID MITES and ORGANIC-MATTER and BIODIVERSITY and ACARI and CLASSIFICATION and INVERTEBRATES and SUCCESSION and MANAGEMENT",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species’ selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1·5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications . A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.","Norway and Ecosystem","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01527.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01527.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In Norway, there are growing concerns about the effect of releasing 2.1 million domestic sheep (Ovis aries) for summer grazing into areas hosting wild populations of alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We quantified the effect of sheep grazing (0, 25 and 80 sheep/km(2)) on the development in coverage and abundance of plants known to be important in the diet of reindeer during summer (vascular plants) and winter (lichens) within a fully replicated, landscape scale (2.7 km(2)) experiment. From 2001 to 2005, the sedge, Carex bigelowii, increased while the herb Solidago virgaurea decreased in frequency at high density of sheep relative to controls (both marginally non-significant). There was no marked development in Deschampsia flexuosa, Salix herbacea or Hierarcium alpinum that could be related to sheep grazing intensity. Lichen coverage and height both decreased at high density of sheep from 2002 to 2005. Effects of low grazing intensity were closer to controls than to high grazing intensity. Our study highlights that high sheep grazing intensity induce changes to the plant community that, at the same time, can improve the summer habitat and detriment the winter habitat to reindeer. Many wild reindeer populations are fragmented and may thus be limited by either summer or winter range. The effect of sheep grazing is predicted to vary accordingly. However, currently, we have limited ability to quantify how much this explicitly means in terms of increased or reduced carrying capacity for reindeer.",NA,"10.1007/s10344-008-0171-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0171-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Cruise ships make landings all around the archipelago, and there are numerous snowmobile, boat and hiking excursions. We describe disturbance effects on the three geese species that breed in Svalbard: the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the light-bellied brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). All three are regarded as highly vulnerable to disturbance. Behavioural responses by geese to humans on foot were analysed by estimating the distances at which geese become alerted, the escape flight distances and the length of escape flights, during pre-nesting, nesting and brood-rearing periods. We evaluate the consequences of human intrusion on the reproductive success in breeding colonies. During all three phases, pink-footed geese responded at longer ranges, and flew/ran longer distances, than both brent and barnacle geese: when disturbed on the nest site, both male and female pink-footed geese flew far away, resulting in a high rate of nest loss to avian predators (35%), compared with the 4 and 0% losses among barnacle and brent geese, respectively. During brood rearing, families of pink-footed geese escaped at an average distance of 1717 m, compared with distances of 620 and 330 m for brent and barnacle geese, respectively. Even though bird sanctuaries have been established on several islets, with no human access during nesting, many core areas for the three species remain without restrictions, such as islets used by brent geese and slopes and valleys with nesting pink-footed geese, brood-rearing areas and moulting grounds for non-breeding geese. We propose regulations of human access to goose concentration areas, and address the need to better protect these significant areas. We also discuss the need for further research on the vulnerability of geese to human activity.","Barnacle goose and brent goose and disturbance impact and pink-footed goose and recreational activities and tourism and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES and BRANTA LEUCOPSIS and DIETARY OVERLAP and HABITAT USE and BARNACLE and EXPLOITATION and INCUBATION and SUCCESS and Social Control, Informal and Social Control, Formal","10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Full recovery of the original range will require restoration of migration routes across developed or disturbed areas. We analyzed distribution of around 3500 Rangifer tarandus tarandus (reindeer) during winters (1984–2005) in relation to 10 alpine resorts and prior to and following relocation of ski trails and cabins in Norway done to restore use of former habitat. Reindeer used areas within 15 km of resorts, which is less than expected based on the availability of habitat, most likely as a result of cross-country skiing activity surrounding the resorts, limiting their access to other ranges and historic migration corridors. Reindeer abundance declined and mean distance between reindeer groups and resorts increased with increasing resort size. No apparent habituation to resorts was observed during the 20-year study period. However, when ski trails and an associated tourist cabin were removed to restore access to historic habitat, reindeer moved into the area. No such change in reindeer distribution was observed in the 10 years preceding relocation, or at the other nine resorts where no such experiments were conducted. Regulation of human traffic, relocation of trails, and removal of infrastructure and cabins are apparently effective in restoring access to and use of historic ranges and migration routes. However, restoration of historic migration routes between ranges will likely require the removal of hundreds of recreational cabins in order to become effective.","Recreation","10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00517.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00517.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.",NA,"10.1890/08-0576.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0576.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge.

In particular, nest predation has been found to be accentuated in human-modified forest landscapes. In boreal ecosystems, the assemblage of nest predators is likely to be temporally variable. Thus, multi-year predation studies are required in order to highlight the temporal aspects of habitat and edge-specific ground-nest predation. On this basis, we conducted a 3-year predation study in Northern Norwegian mountain birch forests which had been fragmented by spruce plantations. Track boards were used to identify predators in different habitat and edge types. We used logistic regression to assess the importance and consistency of spatial and temporal predictors for the predation rate of six predator species. Total predation rates were high and were higher in the second and third year (range 89.9-96.7%) compared to the first year of the study (range 57.1-75.3%). Mammalian predation decreased while avian predation increased over the 3 years. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and hooded crow (Corvus cornix) were the dominant predators, followed by raven (Corvus corax) and magpie (Pica pica). Pine marten (Martes martes) and stoat (Mustela erminea) predation was low and almost absent in two of the years. Within the study years, predator species exhibited different temporal trends, probably owing to species-specific functional responses. While some edge types were preferred consistently over time by the dominant predators, the spatial pattern of predation was mainly due to unexplained large-scale differences among landscape blocks. This large-scale pattern was constant over the three study years despite the strong temporal fluctuation in predation rates within and between years.","Hooded crow and Red fox and Space-time interaction and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and RED FOX and BREEDING SUCCESS and CORVID DENSITY and SITE SELECTION and HOODED CROWS and GROUND NESTS and BIRDS NESTS and EDGE and LANDSCAPE","10.1007/s10344-009-0253-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-009-0253-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Key questions to be answered are how herbivore density relates to available resource levels, e.g. food availability and browsing pressure, and how this relation should be monitored and included in management. In Norway, the harvest of red deer Cervus elaphus has increased from 1,479 to 35,700 during 1960-2008. Current monitoring programmes focus on deer body mass and number of seen deer rather than on the state of the vegetation communities. In our study, we quantify browsing frequency on common shrubs and trees in two municipalities, Gloppen and Flora, in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, Norway, to document current browsing pressure levels and to evaluate the potential of using browsing frequency of indicator species as a tool in the monitoring of red deer populations. We found that several species were heavily browsed (median browsing frequency > 60%). Due to their wide availability, we analysed the spatial patterns of accumulated browsing of the highly selected rowan Sorbus aucuparia compared to the less selected bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and birch Betula sp. We predicted less spatial variation in browsing frequency of the highly selected rowan. However, we found that the best model predicting browsing on rowan (forest type, habitat productivity, canopy cover, aspect, slope and distance to arable land) based on habitat variables was more complicated than for birch (habitat productivity and altitude) and bilberry (forest type, habitat productivity, altitude and distance from the coast). This suggests large spatial variation in browsing frequency of rowan even though the average browsing frequency of rowan was higher than for bilberry and birch. Browsing frequency for all species was positively correlated with faeces counts, but only bilberry showed additional correlation with red deer (harvest) density at the local management unit scale. Due to its wide distribution and promising link to local red deer density, bilberry stands out as the most promising species to monitor among winter browse species. However, browsing frequency on different species was not always correlated. It remains to be determined to which extent browsing on bilberry can be used as an indicator for the browsing pressure on the whole vegetation community. The documentation of high browsing frequencies clearly suggests that further focus on these issues is warranted.","Cervus elaphus and density dependence and ecosystem management and monitoring and red deer and sustainability and ungulates and MOOSE ALCES-ALCES and LARGE HERBIVORES and DENSITY and SELECTIVITY and INDICATORS and RESPONSES and IMPACTS and SHEEP","10.2981/09-043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/09-043",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In the present study, traffic related contaminants were quantified in tunnel wash water (the Nordby tunnel, Norway) discharged from a sedimentation pond to a nearby small stream, Arungselva. In situ size and charge fractionation techniques were applied to quantify traffic related metal species, while PAHs were quantified in total samples. All metals and several PAHs appeared at elevated concentrations in the discharged wash water compared with concentrations measured in Arungselva upstream the pond outlet, and to concentrations measured in the pond outlet before the tunnel wash event. In addition, several contaminants (e.g. Cu, Pb, Zn, fluoranthene, pyrene) exceeded their corresponding EQS. PAR and metals like Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb were associated with particles and colloids, while As, Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, Sb and Zn were more associated with low molecular mass species (<10 kDa). Calculated enrichment factors revealed that many of the metals were derived from anthropogenic sources, originating most likely from wear of tires (Zn), brakes (Cu and Sb), and from road salt (Na and Cl). The enrichment factors for Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg and Ni were low, suggesting a crustal origin, e.g. asphalt wear. Based on calculated PAH ratios, PAH seemed to originate from a mixture of sources such as wear from tires, asphalt and combustion. Finally, historical fish length measurement data indicates that the fish population in the receiving stream Arungselva may have been adversely influenced by the chemical perturbations in runoffs originating from the nearby roads and tunnels during the years, as the growth in summer old sea trout (Salmo trutta L) in downstream sections of the stream is significantly reduced compared to the upstream sections.

However, although such impacts are expected to be scale-dependent in ecosystems with wide-roaming ungulates, scaling issues rarely enter empirical assessments. We here test the hypothesis that the impact of increased reindeer abundance on plant diversity in alpine tundra is scale-dependent. Based on potentially high productivity of the focal habitat units and hence the possibility of positive grazer impacts on plant diversity we predicted higher alpha and beta diversity at the habitat scale where reindeer densities are high. We also explored whether there were differences in diversity patterns at larger scales, including the scale of reindeer management districts. We estimated grazing disturbance as high versus low reindeer density in selected districts (a total extent of 7421 km(2)) of Northern Norway where reindeer-induced vegetation shifts are debated. We focus on dominance patterns because they can quantify the vegetation state and thus performed additive partitioning of Simpson diversity on multiple scales assessing also species' contributions to diversity. Contrary to our predictions, we found only weak scale-dependent effects of reindeer grazing on plant diversity. Under high reindeer densities there was evidence for a landscape-scale homogenization of the vegetation, but the predicted alpha and beta diversity increases at the habitat scale were not found. Consistently through all scales considered, four shrub species contributed the most to plant diversity. These results contradict the idea that reindeer at high stocking densities induce shifts in plant species dominance in productive habitats.

Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals. Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity. Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals. Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

The aim of this study was to analyse spider assemblages occurring on farmlands with differing stages of land use intensity. We collected the ground-dwelling spider fauna of semi-natural grasslands in currently farmed and abandoned farmland in the alpine zone of Hardangervidda, Norway, using pitfall traps. Trapping during the whole vegetation period resulted in 1,548 individuals belonging to 39 species of spiders. Linyphiids and lycosids dominated. The total number of species differ little between sites, but there was a general trend of increasing proportions of lycosids, gnaphosids and thomisids individuals and species, and a decrease in the proportion of linyphiids with farmland abandonment. Two main groupings of spider assemblages were found using a principal component analysis: One grouping was characteristic of intensely disturbed sites, mainly dominated by typical pioneer species. The other was characteristic of abandoned and less disturbed sites, dominated by widespread species. The abandonment of summer farms led to a succession in spider assemblages, including a decline in spider species with a high ballooning activity and an increase of species with a larger body size. We suggest that the main reason lies in the absence of disturbance by grazing including differing vegetation architecture and the proportion of bare ground with abandonment. Spider assemblages react quickly to environmental changes that occur in alpine habitats after abandonment. Thus, it is necessary to include spiders and other invertebrate animal indicator groups in field studies and experiments dealing with grazing impacts on alpine habitats.","Abandonment and Alpine Ecosystem and Grazing and Pitfall traps and Spiders and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and LAND-USE and VEGETATION and MOUNTAINS and PATTERNS and NORWAY and PSEUDOREPLICATION and COMMUNITIES and LANDSCAPE and GRADIENTS","10.1007/s10841-010-9272-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9272-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Our analyses were based upon species data from 2201 patch elements in SE Norwegian modern agricultural landscapes. The context used for measuring habitat specificity strongly influences the results. In general the gamma diversity contribution and core habitat specificity calculated from the patch data set were correlated. High values for both measures were observed for woodland, pastures and road verges whereas midfield islets and boundary transitional types were ranked low, as opposed to findings in traditional, extensively managed agricultural landscapes. This is due to our study area representing intensively used agricultural landscape elements holding a more trivial species composition, in addition to ruderals being favoured by fertility and disturbance, a finding also being supported by the semi-natural affiliation index. Results obtained by use of checklist data from the same study area diverged from patch data. Caution is needed in interpretation of habitat specificity results obtained from checklist data, because modern agricultural landscapes contain several land types which are seldom surveyed by botanists, thus being under-represented in the data set. We propose the use of core habitat specificity and gamma diversity contribution in parallel to obtain a value neutral diversity assessment that addresses patch uniqueness and other properties of conservation interests.","Vascular plants and Diversity and Conservation and Checklist and Rare specialist species and SE Norway and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE and DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and SCALE and COMMUNITIES and SWEDEN and ENVIRONMENT and GRASSLANDS and SIMILARITY and Ecosystem","10.1007/s10980-010-9481-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-010-9481-2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

To maintain biodiversity and ecological services of semi-natural grasslands, we need more knowledge on the relative performance of different recreation methods. In a replicated experiment in western Norway, we evaluated two hay transfer methods (hard or light raking of local hay), sowing of local seeds and natural regeneration for recreating semi-natural grassland in a road verge. We compared treated trial plots with their respective donor plots (where hay and seeds were harvested) for three successive years by evaluating vegetation cover, species richness and species transfer rates, and vegetation dynamics analysed by Bray-Curtis compositional dissimilarity (BC) and GNMDS (Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling) ordination. Vegetation cover at the trial site exceeded that of donor sites in three years. Transfer rates of common species were high for seed sowing and both hay transfer procedures. Species composition in trial plots for all three treatments became significantly more similar to donor plots, but was still relatively dissimilar after three years. Natural regeneration showed a different temporal pattern and also had a higher successional rate. The species composition of the other treatments followed the same trajectory toward the donor sites as revealed by GNMDS. We found relatively small differences between the two hay transfer methods and seed sowing. Transfer of local hay therefore appears to be a successful method of establishing local species when recreating semi-natural grasslands, and is generally cheaper than using commercial local seed mixtures.

We hypothesized that developed areas would attract predators and lead to higher predation on willow ptarmigan and lower their abundance. In a 500-km(2) study area in south-central Norway, we sampled the density of territorial cocks in spring and the breeding success of willow ptarmigan along a 3-km gradient extending out from clusters of cabins. We also sampled red fox scats and corvid birds and measured nest predation on artificial nests across this gradient. Densities of cocks in the spring and of adults and brood sizes in August did not vary along the gradient. However, the density of chicks in August was higher beyond 1.5 km from cabin areas, presumably because more hens lost their clutches in the vicinity of cabins. This was supported by the results from the artificial nest experiment where significantly more nests were depredated near cabin areas than further away. The number of scats of red fox along trails increased with distance from cabins, whereas more corvid birds were observed near cabins. We conclude that corvid birds were the main cause of higher loss of ptarmigan nests near cabin areas, which led to lower production of chicks. Breeding density, however, did not seem to vary along the gradient, presumably because of suitable habitat for breeding and little human activity in these areas during the period of pair formation and nesting.","Anthropogenic disturbance and Breeding and Willow grouse and Red fox and Nest predation and Small game and HOODED CROWS and TOURISM and CONSERVATION and POPULATION and SPORTS and NESTS and Mountaineering and Norway and Salix and Recreation","10.1007/s10344-010-0378-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0378-9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

When converting old forest to clearcuts and plantations, commercial forestry has therefore been assumed to affect capercaillie negatively and to be favourable to black grouse. During a 30-year period (1979-2008) we monitored sympatric populations of the two species in a forest in southeast Norway based on annual spring and autumn censuses and radio-marked birds. During this period, the proportion of old, semi-natural forest was halved and clearcuts and young plantations increased accordingly. The grouse populations did not change as predicted. While the trend in August numbers of adult black grouse declined, males more than females, abundance of adult capercaillie remained unchanged. Number of males at leks showed similar patterns. Equally surprising, breeding success (number of chicks per female in August) of both species increased, thus indicating that the populations were regulated more by variation in adult survivorship than by recruitment of young birds. No correlations were found with changing climatic factors (precipitation and temperatures in winter and spring, snow depth and time of snow melt), except that year-to-year breeding success was positively correlated with minimum temperatures during 2 weeks posthatch. The results are explained by a combination of more flexible habitat selection than previously assumed and a changing predator regime: In the early period, nearly all capercaillie leks were located in old, semi-natural forest, but as plantations grew older (> 30 years), new leks were established there. Similarly, while young capercaillie broods used old semi-natural forest almost exclusively when the study started, they frequently used middle-aged plantations, especially those with a ground cover of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, when these became common in later years. The increasing breeding success could largely be explained by more females rearing chicks successfully, presumably due to a marked decline in the main nest predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. A practice of thinning of the old, semi-natural forest some years prior to final harvesting probably facilitated predation of black grouse by goshawks Accipitergentilis. Contrary to many beliefs, our results indicate that both capercaillie and black grouse are quite tolerant to changes in forest management regimes. In our study, numerical and functional responses of predators (mainly red fox and goshawk) apparently played a more important role in regulating grouse numbers than habitat factors per se.

Still, the forest canopy was lush green and characterised by large tree-crowns. This situation was referred to as the ""Green lie'' and was advocated by foresters throughout Scandinavia as an argument in favour of forestry practices based on clear-felling. Here we examine effects of past selective loggings on forest structure and composition in a spruce forest landscape using dendroecology and historical records. Our results show that forests that were selectively logged up to the early 1900s could be structurally heterogeneous with multi-layered canopies, varying degree of openness and continuous presence of old trees across different spatial scales. Because the past forests were not clear-felled, a diverse forest structure in terms of tree species composition and age and diameter distribution was maintained over time, which could enable forest-dwelling species to persist during the early phase following the loggings in the past. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in most modern managed forest landscapes in Scandinavia. A better understanding of the link between loggings in the past- and present-day forest structure and diversity will contribute to rewarding discussions on forestry methods for the future.","Biodiversity and dendroecology and forest history and historical records and selective logging and WOOD-INHABITING FUNGI and PICEA-ABIES FOREST and OLD-GROWTH and SPRUCE FORESTS and BEETLES COLEOPTERA and USNEA-LONGISSIMA and MANAGED FORESTS and POPULUS-TREMULA and NORTHERN SWEDEN and BOREAL and Norway","10.1080/02827581.2011.628950     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2011.628950",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

In contrast to other European mountain regions, highly relevant climate variables such as the triterm (the summer months) have not changed in the studied region. Therefore, land-use change is considered the main driver for the forest line shifts observed in the region.

Fright response distances sampled in the field were significantly longer when approached by a snow-kiter than by a skier. A simulation model predicts a different outcome of daytime disturbances for reindeer from free ranging snow-kiters versus skiers confined to prepared ski trails. The expected number of encounters with reindeer increases linearly with increasing number of snow-kiters until it reaches a threshold level and then stabilizes, but the number of snow-kiters reaching a threshold will vary depending on the speed of the kite (252 snow-kiters at 8.8 km h(-1) or 96 at 20 km h(-1)). The relative loss of habitat and daytime feeding for reindeer following encounters with snow-kiters moving randomly within their range increases progressively up to a 100% reduction at 241 or 111 snow-kiters at a speed of 8.8 and 20 km h(-1), respectively. Above this number of snow-kiters, reindeer will not feed and have nowhere to escape. Reindeer progressively reduce up to 7.5% of their daytime feeding until the number of skiers reaches 105. Above 105 skiers and as the number of skiers continues to increase, reindeer find refuge away from ski trails and their feeding time increases and returns to a zero percent reduction at 133 skiers or more.

Assessment of the relative importance of these influences on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is crucial for guiding policy and management decisions to mitigate global change; yet, few studies consider multiple drivers. In the UK, ongoing loss of the internationally important arctic/alpine moss-sedge community, Racomitrium heath, has been linked to elevated N deposition, high grazing pressures and their combination; however, the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear. We used environmental gradients across the habitat's European distribution (UK, Faroes, Norway and Iceland) to investigate the relative impact of N deposition and grazing pressure, as well as climate, on the condition of the dominant moss species, Racomitrium lanuginosum. Key variables including tissue chemistry, growth and cover were measured at 36 sites, and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the relative importance of the drivers across sites. Our results clearly show that regional variation in the condition of R. lanuginosum across Europe is primarily associated with the impacts of N deposition, with climate (air temperature) and grazing pressure playing secondary roles. In contrast to previous experimental studies, we found moss growth to be stimulated by elevated N deposition; this apparent discrepancy may result from the use of artificially high N concentrations in many experiments.

Mountain regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate, and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant communities? Location Southern Scandes, Norway. Methods We use a unique long-term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions. Results We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational advance than species from higher altitudes. Conclusions This study presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the potential to buffer climate-driven shifts in plant communities. Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the vulnerability of alpine communities to warming.","Climate change and Distribution and Grazing and Land use and Livestock and Mountain and Norway and Sheep and Warming and SPECIES RICHNESS and VASCULAR PLANTS and ECOLOGICAL DATA and CLIMATE-CHANGE and SHIFT and PRODUCTIVITY and IMPACTS and BIODIVERSITY and CONTRACTIONS and DEGRADATION","10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01391.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01391.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra.

However, today, the focus of river restoration has shifted towards improving biological functionality and biodiversity. In the present study, two weirs, originally built to create a stable water level, were removed on a residual flow reach in a Norwegian regulated river as a measure to restore river connectivity and to re-establish the local population of Atlantic salmon. The removal design was based on hydraulic modelling, and biological monitoring was implemented before and after the weir removal to evaluate the biological response to weir removal. The results demonstrated that salmon spawning sites were recreated in the old bed substratum and were occupied immediately the first season after weir removal, when water velocities increased to more suitable levels for spawning. Accordingly, mortality of Atlantic salmon eggs was reduced and the densities of juveniles showed a marked increase after weir removal. Conversely, pike and cyprinids in the reach were found in the samples before weir removal but not after removal, indicating that the desired shift in fish community in response to habitat alteration was obtained. Furthermore, enumeration of migrating adult salmon at a fishway upstream of the study reach showed that the migration peak, on average, was 1?month earlier in the 3?years after removal as compared with the 5?years before removal. Finally, the use of hydraulic modelling represented a useful method for designing physical habitat adjustments and assessing their influence on fish biology. The model results also supported a rapid process in planning and execution of construction works.

To better understand the ecosystem's capabilities for recovery we investigated vegetation cover changes over a 7-yr period, starting in 1998, at 52 sites dispersed over a large area at Finnmarksvidda. Two types of plots were established: one fenced from reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period. Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083 +/- 0.011 per year in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time, fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition, lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz, shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were repairable. The vegetation transitions which have taken place in the study area are considered to be reversible with fewer persistent effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

The population in the Setesdal Austhei wild reindeer area still migrates from winter to calving grounds by semi-annually crossing a cabin-lined road through a narrow corridor, in which further anthropogenic development is planned. To understand if and how infrastructure affected reindeer migration patterns we studied the movements of 10 female reindeer equipped with GPS collars between 2002 and 2010. First, we identified the start and end of the migration period, and then we compared trajectory parameters (net displacement, step length and turning angles) recorded during migration with those recorded in proximity of the road. The analysis of the net displacement indicated that during spring migration reindeer moved at a constant pace towards the calving ground covering a net linear distance of 25 km in 40 days. In the middle of migration, reindeer changed travel direction and roamed parallel to the road for ca. 5 days without approaching further, possibly searching for an undisturbed place and time to cross. Reindeer finally crossed the road before daylight with highly directed movements, increasing their travel speed up to the highest values recorded during migration (4 km/3 hrs vs. 0.5 km/3 hrs). After crossing, reindeer moved quickly toward their calving ground covering the remaining 25 km net distance in less than a week. Migration patterns were markedly affected by disturbance during spring, as the road crossings occurred in the period characterized by the high traffic volume and intense human activities related to Easter holidays; during autumn, on the contrary, the hampering effect of the road was minimal. The results suggest that the current disturbance associated to the road hampers spring migration and might delay the arrival to the calving ground. The planned construction of a large number of recreational cabins in the migration corridor has the potential to threaten the migration and obstruct the access to the calving ground.

The fields were located in the southeastern (A), central (B) and western (C) parts of Norway. In total, 3945 spiders were caught from May to September 2004, using pitfall traps. Linyphidae was the most numerous family, with Erigone atra Blackwall 1833 representing 56% of all trapped individuals. The total numbers of spider species and individuals were significantly higher in leys than in barley at sites where both crops were present (sites A and B), with on average 11 species and 93 specimens in barley, and 20 species and 393 specimens in leys. Thus, young perennial leys appeared to provide a better habitat for spiders than did cereal fields, as has previously been documented for older perennial leys. The use of multi-species crops instead of a single crop species undersown in cereals, tended to result in higher spider species diversity, but it did not influence the total number of specimens. An ordination (DCA) showed a clustering of the spider fauna from the same site, but no clear separation between main crop types (ley vs. barley) was apparent. The main crops, subcrops, and the surrounding environs of the cropped field seem to affect the diversity and abundance of spiders.","Cereal and community structure and farming and meadow and CEREAL FIELDS and CROPPING SYSTEMS and PEST-CONTROL and LANDSCAPE and HABITAT and WHEAT and RECOLONIZATION and PRODUCTIVITY and PREDATORS and NITROGEN","10.1636/P12-32.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1636/P12-32.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems, Agricultural landscapes","Observational studies"

However, few forests are currently co-managed for timber and wildlife, despite potential economic and conservation benefits. We present empirical data from a commercial Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) production system in southern Norway in which moose (Alces alces) are an important secondary product. Combining long-term hunting and forestry records, we identified temporal variation in clear-felling over the past five decades, peaking in the 1970s. Herbicide treatment of regenerating stands and a fivefold increase in moose harvest has lead to a reduction in availability of successional forest per moose of > 90 % since the 1960s. Field estimates showed that spraying with the herbicide glyphosate reduced forage availability by 60 and 96 % in summer and winter, respectively, 4 years after treatment. It also reduced moose use and habitat selection of young spruce stands compared with unsprayed stands. Together these lines of evidence suggest that forest management led to an increase in moose carrying capacity during the 1970s and a subsequent decline thereafter. This is likely to have contributed to observed reductions in moose population productivity in southern Norway and is counter to sustainable resource management. We therefore call for better integration and long-term planning between forestry and wildlife management to minimise forest damage and the development of large fluctuations in ungulate populations.","Boreal forest and Clear-cut and Deer and Forest vegetation management and Multiple-use forestry and Multi-purpose forest management and GLYPHOSATE-TREATED CLEARCUTS and HABITAT SELECTION and CARRYING-CAPACITY and ALCES-ALCES and SCOTS PINE and BODY-MASS and FORAGE and UNGULATE and VEGETATION and DENSITY","10.1007/s10342-013-0727-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-013-0727-9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

We compared bilberry from mature stands and clear-cuts in a spruce forest landscape in south-central Norway, and applied the following experimental treatments: fertilisation, root cutting and flower removal to evaluate the effect of resource availability. During the second growing season we estimated bilberry shoot biomass as well as flowering and berry production, while bilberry shoots and leaves were collected in early summer and autumn for analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phenolic compound concentrations. The biomass of bilberry shoots was highest on clear-cuts and after fertilisation. All groups of phenolic compounds were also highest on clear-cuts, and phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in non-fertilised plots. Catechins and condensed tannins were highest in autumn, while phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in summer. Removal of flowers and root cutting had no effects. Nitrogen concentrations in shoots were highest in summer, after fertilisation, and when flowers were removed. The amount of flowers was highest in non-fertilised, mature forest sites, while the berry production was not significantly affected by any of the treatments or the site type. Our results indicate that in the studied area, the performance of bilberry is not negatively affected by clear-cutting, it rather seems that the environment on the clear-cuts give the plants abundant resources for enhancements both in growth, reproduction and defence compared with the mature forest sites.

By conducting a nation-wide, interdisciplinary pre-post study on a temporal scale spanning centuries, we modelled current reindeer movements with respect to archaeological findings to quantify long-term changes in area use related to anthropogenic disturbance. The location of 3,113 pitfall traps and hunting blinds, built 600-2000 years ago and used until 350-400 years ago, testified the location of traditional movement corridors. Current movement routes were delineated using Brownian Bridge Movement Models based on 147 reindeer GPS-monitored during 10 years. Using Path Analysis we quantified direct, indirect and total effects of different infrastructures within multiple scales (1, 5, and 10 km-radius buffers) on the current probability of use of ancient movement corridors. Tourist cabins and roads had the strongest long-term direct effects at most scales: 1 tourist cabin and 1 km road within a 1 km-radius buffer would lead, respectively, to complete area abandonment, and to a 46 % decrease in the probability of use. Power lines and private cabins had significant indirect effects on area use through their effect on roads, while hiking trails and, in particular, hydroelectric dams had highly variable effects, not significant at a nation-wide scale.

However, animals sometimes prefer habitats of apparently low quality, especially when considering the costs associated with spatially heterogeneous human disturbance. We used spatial variation in human disturbance, and its consequences on lynx survival, a direct fitness component, to test the Hierarchical Habitat Selection hypothesis from a population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in southern Norway. Data from 46 lynx monitored with telemetry indicated that a high proportion of forest strongly reduced the risk of mortality from legal hunting at the home range scale, while increasing road density strongly increased such risk at the finer scale within the home range. We found hierarchical effects of the impact of human disturbance, with a higher road density at a large scale reinforcing its negative impact at a fine scale. Conversely, we demonstrated that lynx shifted their habitat selection to avoid areas with the highest road densities within their home ranges, thus supporting a compensatory mechanism at fine scale enabling lynx to mitigate the impact of large-scale disturbance. Human impact, positively associated with high road accessibility, was thus a stronger driver of lynx space use at a finer scale, with home range characteristics nevertheless constraining habitat selection. Our study demonstrates the truly hierarchical nature of habitat selection, which aims at maximising fitness by selecting against limiting factors at multiple spatial scales, and indicates that scale-specific heterogeneity of the environment is driving individual spatial behaviour, by means of trade-offs across spatial scales.","Ecosystem","10.1371/journal.pone.0065493","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065493",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Numerous studies have assessed the relationships between attributes of urban green spaces (size, vegetation, isolation, urbanization) and bird species richness, but little is known about how these factors influence community composition. I censused breeding land birds in 93 urban green spaces in Oslo, Norway, and species were grouped according to ecology (habitat preference, nest site, migration, diet, and red-list status). I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city.","Urban biodiversity and Urban greenspace and Area effect and Habitat effect and Isolation effect and SPECIES RICHNESS and AVIAN COMMUNITY and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE and DIVERSITY and GRADIENT and AVIFAUNA and PARKS and CITY and DETERMINANTS","10.1007/s11252-017-0706-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-017-0706-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Particularly increasing urbanisation may affect species turnover and functional composition of biological communities. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of land-cover change in a medium-sized urban municipality from 2011 to 2018, and the effects of urbanisation on avian species- and functional diversity. The study was performed in Trondheim (Norway), using local land-cover maps and GBIF bird species occurrence records. GLMMs were used to model species turnover as a function of urbanisation, and the probability of species appearance and disappearance based on urbanisation and species traits. The extent of bird species turnover within a municipality-wide 500 × 500m2 grid was not predicted by a changes in developed area, but the probability of disappearance and appearance of bird species varied with urbanisation and bird functional traits. Species associated with urban- or open areas showed a decreasing probability of disappearing and an increasing probability of appearing with increasing amount of developed area within grid cells. Similarly, granivorous species showed a decreasing probability of disappearing. Species feeding above ground-level showed positive responses to changes in land-cover. The probability of both appearance and disappearance, thus species turnover, increased with increasing longevity. Most functional groups respond negatively to increasing urbanisation, indicating a potential impoverishment of local avifauna with future land-cover modifications. Considering planned future land-cover changes within the municipality, the local avian communities are in danger of homogenisation. The recommendations for local management are to minimise conversion of vulnerable habitats, such as wetlands and woodlands, in particular if these are converted to developed area. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bird diversity and Functional groups and Land-cover change and Urbanisation","10.1007/s11252-022-01258-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-022-01258-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"
"193","rayyan-674232957","Natural and anthropogenic drivers of escaped farmed salmon occurrence and introgression into wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations","ICES Journal of Marine Science","Marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a relatively new industry where breeding programs have led to rapid genetic change in the captive populations that were built up alongside conspecific wild individuals. Throughout its 50-years history, marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon has been associated with escapes, and studies have shown that escapees may enter rivers, spawn successfully, and this may lead to farmed-to-wild genetic introgression and maladaptation in wild populations. Yet, an open question is what factors can best explain the variability in the proportion of farmed escapees in wild populations, and when present, which additional factors lead to introgression. Here, we combine two large-scale data sets from monitoring escaped farmed salmon and introgression in Norwegian rivers between 2006 and 2018 to model how anthropogenic, environmental, and population factors influence proportion of escapees and level of introgression. We found that increasing farming intensity and river discharge increase the expected proportions of escaped farmed salmon in rivers, whereas a larger wild salmon population size reduces the expected proportion of escapees despite increasing the expected absolute numbers of escaped farmed salmon. On a large scale, introgression is primarily a function of proportions of escaped farmed salmon, and only to a minor extent a function of local environmental factors or salmon population characteristics. This suggests that as long as salmon aquaculture is based on technologies where non-sterile fish can escape, all anadromous wild Atlantic salmon populations are at risk. Large marine protected areas without salmon aquaculture may slow down the rate of intrusion and introgression by increasing the distance between intensive aquaculture and wild populations. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, traits of bryophytes and lichens, important components of many ecosystems, have received less attention than those of vascular plants. We explored the use of functional traits of multiple important organism groups in recovery assessment. We combined data on traits and species composition for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens from four alpine spoil heaps and their undisturbed surroundings in western Norway, collected at three time-points spanning more than two decades. We studied changes in community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values and distribution of trait-category optima over time. We analyzed temporal variation in joint functional trait composition using the ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) to predict time to recovery. We observed functional shifts along the successional gradient for all organism groups, e.g. from wind-dispersed propagules shortly after disturbance to vegetative reproduction at later successional stages. Over time, the similarity between dispersal-related traits of vascular plants and bryophytes on the spoil heaps and in their surroundings increased, indicating that propagule influx is important in alpine restoration. The joint functional trait composition of all spoil heaps converged towards that of their surroundings: one spoil heap had recovered 34 years after construction, while the predicted time to recovery for the other three was 59–74 years. Our results indicate that inclusion of multiple organism groups improves trait-based recovery assessments and time-to-recovery predictions. Further development of trait databases is essential for future use of joint functional trait composition in recovery assessment. © 2020 The Authors.

This dead wood is most prevalent in old-growth forest, yet intensive management means that little old growth is left, and the remaining forests rarely attain the necessary age and structure to resemble these original forests. There is increasing recognition, however, that forests that have not been subjected to modern, stand-replacing harvest methods (like clear-cutting), and in which management activities are no longer occurring, may be able to provide habitat similar to old-growth forest for many species (older mean age, higher deadwood volumes, and more age-class heterogeneity). These are called ‘near-natural’ forests. We use linear mixed models and redundancy analysis (RDA) to compare beetle species richness and community composition using a large, mixed data set, containing more than one third of all beetle species known from Norway, from window trap records in three types of forest: intensively managed mature stands, recent clear-cuts, and ‘near-natural forests’. Even though location, study substrate and other sampling details vary substantially between sites, the signal from management still comes out as a significant factor explaining the patterns on beetle diversity. We find that species richness of saproxylic, natural-forest indicator, and red-listed beetle species is higher in both near-natural forests and recent clear-cuts than in managed mature forests. Community composition also differs significantly between the three forest types, and these differences are correlated with forest age and volume at the landscape (1 km radius) level. These findings provide support for the idea that near-natural forests provide habitats that are distinct from those in managed forests and which are important for species of conservation concern. Clear-cuts briefly harbor some of these same species, probably due to the sun-exposed coarse woody debris (CWD) that is available immediately after felling, but this effect is transient. Conservation of existing near-natural forests, many of which are currently without legal protection, should therefore be prioritized. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity and Clear-cuts and Coleoptera and CWD and Forest management and Indicator species and Landscape scale and Near-natural forests and Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Saproxylic and Window traps and Conservation and Dead Wood and Ecosystems and Forestry and Forests and Growth and Management and Norway and Living systems studies and Redundancy and Clear cuts and Natural forests and beetle and biodiversity and bioindicator and clearcutting and coarse woody debris and community composition and conservation status and dead wood and forest ecosystem and forest management and growth and old-growth forest and species richness and Trees","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118124","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118124",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

However, such shifts can be limited by a variety of non-climatic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil conditions, landscape fragmentation and some species-specific traits. Many changes in species distributions have been observed, although no evidence of complete community replacement has been registered yet. Climatic signals are often confounded with the effects of human activity, for example, forest encroachment at the treeline owing to the coupled effect of climate change and highland pasture abandonment. Data on the treeline ecotone, barriers to the expected treeline or dominant tree species shifts due to climate and land use change, and their possible impacts on biodiversity in 11 mountain areas of interest, from Italy to Norway and from Spain to Bulgaria, are reported. We investigated the role of environmental conditions on treeline ecotone features with a focus on treeline shift. The results showed that treeline altitude and the altitudinal width of the treeline ecotone, as well as the significance of climatic and soil parameters as barriers against tree species shift, significantly decreased with increasing latitude. However, the largest part of the commonly observed variability in mountain vegetation near the treeline in Europe seems to be caused by geomorphological, geological, pedological and microclimatic variability in combination with different land use history and present socio-economic relations.","Vegetation zone shift and Climate change and Climate models and Treeline ecotone and European mountains and Ecosystem services and FAGUS-SYLVATICA L. and LAND-USE CHANGE and CLIMATE-CHANGE and GLOBAL-CHANGE and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and RANGE SHIFTS and ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE and FOREST STRUCTURE and SWEDISH SCANDES and SWISS ALPS","10.3354/cr01465     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3354/cr01465",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Yet little is known about the mechanisms by which PAs are colonized by NNS, and more specifically the role of colonizing events from surrounding areas. Here, we compared terrestrial and freshwater non-native plants and animals recorded in Norwegian PAs and in 5-km belts around them, using the database of the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre Species Map Service. Our analysis included 1,602 NNS and 671 PAs. We found that NNS were recorded in only 23% of the PAs, despite the fact that 90% of the 5-km belts were colonized by at least one NNS. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed that the number of NNS in the 5-km belts was a strong explanatory variable of the NNS richness inside PAs. Other significant variables included the surface area of the PA, mean human population density in the PA, main type of habitat and accessibility of PAs. We also observed similarity in the species in and around the PAs, with, on average, two thirds of the NNS present in a specific PA also present in its 5-km belt. Furthermore, NNS were recorded in PAs on average 4.5 years after being recorded in the 0–5 km belts, suggesting a dynamic of rapid colonization from the belts to the PAs. Invasive NNS represented 12% of NNS in the belts but 40% in the PAs. This difference was related to the higher abundance of invasive NNS in the belts. Our results highlight the necessity of expanding the focus of NNS management in PAs beyond their boundaries, in particular to prevent incursions of NNS with high negative ecological impact. © Copyright © 2021 Holenstein, Simonson, Smith, Blackburn and Charpentier.","alien species and invasive species and non-native species and protected area boundaries and protected areas and species distribution","10.3389/fevo.2020.625137","https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.625137",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Multiple","Observational studies"

Do the results depend on autocorrelation in geographical space and species ordination space? Species richness is expected to increase as a function of the size of an island; are the responses to island size different between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands. Does the land-use history have an impact on the current species composition and richness pattern? LocationThe archipelago is in the oceanic section of the Atlantic bioclimatic zone, west Norway. This archipelago was part of the ancient and widespread treeless heathland found along the European west coast. MethodsData on vascular plants were compiled from the forested islands, and their differences in species composition were analysed by ordination. The hypotheses were tested by means of t-tests and generalized linear models, the spatial component was accounted for by means of Moran's I and spatial autoregression with the moving average approach. This was done both in geographical space and species ordination space. ResultsThere are more vascular plants on the islands with introduced P.mugo than on the islands with native P.sylvestris. The latter have rather homogenous undergrowth dominated by bryophytes. This may explain lower richness on islands with native forest and why island size is not correlated with species richness on these islands. In contrast, P.mugo is easily wind-felled in autumn storms, which keeps rocky microhabitats exposed to air and new forest habitats are created. Species that are associated with the previous land-use system (grazing) prevail on islands with introduced pine, and thus contribute to higher plant richness. ConclusionsThe difference in species richness and island species-area relationship (ISAR) between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands may relate to the same underpinning causes. Species from the old land-use system have survived on P.mugo islands, but not in the late-successional forest with a more closed canopy that has developed on P.sylvestris islands. Thus habitat and species richness is higher and increases with area on P.mugo islands but not on P.sylvestris islands.","Autocorrelation and Diversity and Introduced species and Island biogeography and Pine and Richness and Spatial Autoregression and Species space and SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION and WESTERN NORWAY and GEOGRAPHICAL ECOLOGY and BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS and PLANT INVASIONS and RED HERRINGS and FRAMEWORK and FOREST and GLOBALIZATION and BIODIVERSITY","10.1111/jvs.12045     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12045",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal","Observational studies"

Many studies have examined the impact of climate change on ecosystem carbon storage, but few have investigated the impact of land-use change and herbivory. However, land-use change is a major aspect of environmental change, and livestock grazing is the most extensive land use globally. In this study, we combine a grazing exclosure experiment and a natural experiment to test the impact of grazer exclusion on vegetation dynamics and ecosystem carbon stores in the short term (12-year exclosures), and the long term (islands inaccessible to livestock), in a heavily grazed mountain region in Norway. Following long-term absence of sheep, birch forest was present. The grazing-resistant grass Nardus stricta, dominated under long-term grazing, whilst the selected grass Deschampsia flexuosa and herb species dominated the vegetation layer in the long-term absence of sheep. The established birch forest led to vegetation carbon stocks being higher on the islands (0.56 kg C m(-2) on the islands compared to 0.18 kg C m(-2) where grazed) and no difference in soil carbon stocks. In the short-term exclusion of sheep, there were minor differences in carbon stocks reflecting the longer term changes. These results show that aboveground carbon stocks are higher in the long-term absence of sheep than in the continual presence of high sheep densities, associated with a vegetation state change between tundra and forest. The reduction of herbivore populations can facilitate forest establishment and increase aboveground carbon stocks, however, the sequestration rate is low.","biomass and tundra and herbivory and land-use and livestock and treeline and MOUNTAIN BIRCH FOREST and LAND-USE CHANGES and TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS and LARGE HERBIVORES and CYCLE FEEDBACKS and SOIL CARBON and CLIMATE and VEGETATION and STORAGE and RESPONSES and Trees","10.1007/s10021-014-9784-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9784-2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Forest expansion is also a major trend in Norway, with an annual increase of about 24.6 million m(3) during 2007-11. Similar trends were found in the study area at Mt FlOyen, Bergen, western Norway. Two types of forest expansion were discovered: expansion of alien coniferous tree species from plantations and spontaneous expansion of native Betula pubescens. Historical data on livestock grazing and climate were used to detect possible drivers of forestation. Forest expansion started in the 1970s, in a period when average July temperatures were lower than the period before. This is an indication that forest expansion was triggered by another cause than increasing summer temperatures. The area used to be heathland for livestock pasture but grazing came to an end around 1900. The area is well below the upper alpine forest limit and forestation should be expected when grazing ceased. The reason why forestation started so late is that neighbouring areas were also deforested. Forestation took place when trees planted in the 1950s began to produce seeds from the 1970s. During the twentieth century birch colonized steep slopes and still continues to do so in abandoned pastures. A distinct increase in July temperatures was found since 2000, which may increase the speed of future forest expansion. This will cause a substantial increase in uptake and storage of carbon, and will decrease the need for afforestation of new open land as suggested by some governmental bodies.","forestation drivers and climate change and land-use change and COASTAL HEATHLANDS and DRIVING FORCES and VEGETATION and DYNAMICS and TREELINE and ALPS and TIME","10.1111/geoa.12056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/geoa.12056",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

The comparative analysis reveals clear dependence on the latitude (and, therefore, on the changing environmental conditions) correlated with the wild ungulate abundance and diversity. Following a geographic pattern, the wolf is specialised on different species of ungulates: moose and reindeer in Scandinavia, red deer in Central and Eastern Europe and wild boar in Southern Europe. Where this large prey is taken, the roe deer is hunted with almost the same frequency in every region. The wolf diet in Europe shows two ecological adaptations formed by a complex of variables: 1. Wolves living in natural habitats with abundance of wild ungulates feed mainly on wild prey. 2. In highly anthropogenic habitats, with low abundance of wild prey, wolves feed on livestock (where husbandry of domestic animals is available) and take also a lot of plant food, smaller prey (hares and rodents) and garbage food. The frequency of occurrence of wild ungulates in the diet of wolves in North Europe varies from 54.0% in Belarus to 132.7% in Poland, while that of livestock is in the range from 0.4% in Norway to 74.9% in Belarus. In South Europe, the frequency of occurrence of wild prey varies from 0% in Italy and Spain to 136.0% in Italy, while of domestic ungulates ranges between 0% and 100% in Spain. The low density or lack of wild prey triggers the switch of the wolf diet to livestock, plant food (32.2-85% in Italy) or even garbage (up to 41.5% in Italy).","Wolf and Canis lupus and prey and adaptive strategy and BIALOWIEZA PRIMEVAL FOREST and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and FOOD-HABITS and ROE DEER and UNGULATE ABUNDANCE and TROPHIC ECOLOGY and FEEDING-HABITS and WOLVES and PREDATION and WILD and Europe",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

A comparison of three area-based conservation tools for wood-living species in boreal forests","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Loss of natural forests and decline in forest biodiversity has led to several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for conservation measures is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based conservation measures commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags. Eight replicated sites for each of the three conservation measures were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species. We found larger differences in species composition between conservation measures for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the conservation measures. There was considerable variation in response to conservation measures between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides. Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the conservation measures, while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all conservation measures. We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies.

Here we use the first long-term dataset on an entire oak-living beetle community in hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) to ask whether policy-driven conservation actions aimed at vulnerable species can also be proactive for unthreatened, but irreplaceable species. Hollow oaks are vital keystone structures that are rich in both vulnerable and irreplaceable wood-living beetles. We sampled in excess of 23,000 individuals from 307 species over four seasons, across the oak range in Norway. We assessed the importance of key environmental variables for vulnerable, irreplaceable and generalist species. We show that simple management actions taken to benefit vulnerable species in hollow trees could also contribute to preventing the decline of important, irreplaceable species. Clearing regrowth is predicted to increase vulnerable species richness by 75-100%, specialist richness by 65%, and to benefit two generalist species. Regrowth clearance is likely to be similarly beneficial in all oak-based habitats with hollow trees across Europe and North America. Increased oak circumference and local habitat quantity were also beneficial for species richness and influenced species composition. Based on this we provide advice for targeting conservation action. We suggest economic, carbon and recreational benefits of clearance that could increase the attractiveness of conservation for policy-makers. We show the importance of examining large-scale conservation planning principles at a local scale to elicit how they work on the ground where conservation actually happens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In particular, concern is raised for several forest-dwelling species such as capercaillie and black grouse, because their habitats are continuously changing and deteriorating from human development. Conservation of these species is linked to sustainable forest management that seeks to benefit multiple species, which demands knowledge about demographic rates in relation to forest composition and structure. We related the spatial variation in adult density and chick production of capercaillie and black grouse to landscape characteristics from 13 areas within the boreal forest of Norway. Linear mixed effects models showed that black grouse and capercaillie had similar associations to landscape characteristics. Adult density of both species was positively related to the proportion of old forest (> 80 years), but only if the area had large proportions of mid to high productive forests. Chick production was negatively related to the proportion of old forest, but positively to habitat diversity and more so for black grouse compared to capercaillie. However, the result for chick production suggest that other forest types also are important, and that forest grouse needs a variety of habitats during their life history stages. Management that seeks to simultaneously conserve populations of black grouse and capercaillie needs to ensure a matrix of various forest types. A special focus must be on the critical life history of local populations to successfully preserve viable populations, for black grouse and capercaillie this implies protection of old and mid to high productive forest while keeping a heterogeneous landscape.","Adult density and Chick production and Forest composition and Landscape heterogeneity and Tetrao tetrix and Tetrao urogallus and Wildlife ecology and CAPERCAILLIE TETRAO-UROGALLUS and BLACK-GROUSE and BOREAL FOREST and HABITAT SELECTION and POPULATIONS and MODELS and SIZE and FRAGMENTATION and MORTALITY and PREDATION and Trees","10.1007/s10980-013-9960-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-013-9960-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Yet, macrophytes can provide important refuge and nursery habitats for fish. Little is known about the consequences of macrophyte removal for fish behavioural space use and habitat selection. We hypothesised that macrophyte removal would affect brown trout (Salmo trutta) movement during the partial removal of the aquatic plant Juncus bulbosus (L.) in an oligotrophic impounded Norwegian river.We tagged 94 brown trout and tracked them using passive acoustic telemetry for 10 months and mapped the cover of J. bulbosus. Trout behavioural patterns were quantified as space use (utilisation areas 50% and 95%) which was linked to habitat use and selection for J. bulbosus. Removal of J. bulbosus influenced space use of brown trout by reducing the core utilisation area by 22%. Habitat use and selection were likewise influenced by removal with increased use and selection of areas with low J. bulbosus cover (<25%) with corresponding reduction in high J. bulbosus cover (>25–75%). Finally, diurnal differences in space use and habitat use were found, with 19% larger utilisation areas at night and higher use of areas with low J. bulbosus during daytime. Yet, all effect sizes were relatively small compared to the size of the study area. This research provides a detailed case study on the effects of macrophyte removal on fish behavioural patterns in a section of a large Norwegian river with macrophyte mass development. We found no large effects of removal on trout behaviour but noted an increased use of areas with low macrophyte cover.

Recent altitudinal range expansion and a perceived population increase have become topics of concern in Scandinavia, primarily due to the potential impacts of red foxes on both prey and competitor species. However, despite it being a common species, there is still surprisingly little knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics of its population dynamics. In this study, we synthesized 12 years of snow-track transect data covering a 27,000-km2 study area to identify factors associated with red fox distribution and population dynamics. Using Bayesian hierarchical regression models, we evaluated the relationships of landscape productivity and climate gradients as well as anthropogenic subsidies with an index of red fox population size and growth rates. We found that landscapes with high human settlement density and large amounts of gut piles from moose (Alces alces) hunting were associated with higher red fox abundances. Population dynamics were characterized by direct density-dependent growth, and the structure of density dependence was best explained by the amount of agricultural land in the landscape. Population equilibrium levels increased, and populations were more stable, in areas with a higher presence of agricultural lands, whereas density-dependent population growth was more prominent in areas of low agricultural presence. We conclude that human land use is a dominant driver of red fox population dynamics in the boreal forest. We encourage further research focusing on contrasting effects of anthropogenic subsidization on predator population carrying capacities and temporal stability, and potential impacts on prey dynamics. © 2020, The Author(s).","Density dependence and Human land use and Landscape ecology and Population dynamics and Red fox and Norway and Scandinavia and Alces alces and Vulpes and Vulpes vulpes and abundance and agricultural land and anthropogenic effect and boreal forest and canid and climate change and density dependence and growth rate and human activity and human settlement and land use and landscape and population growth and population size and range expansion and Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.1007/s13364-020-00494-y","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13364-020-00494-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, the effects of habitat improvement schemes in power line clearings on components of diversity are poorly studied. We conducted a large-scale experiment to test the effects of different management practices on the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of wild bees in power line clearings (n=19 sites across southeastern Norway) and explored whether any treatment effects were modified by the environmental context. At each site, we conducted the following treatments: (1) Cut: all trees cut and left to decay in the clearing; (2) Cut+Remove: all trees cut and removed from the plot; and (3) Uncut: uncleared. The site-specific environmental context (i.e., elevation and floral diversity) influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity within bee species assemblages. The largest number of species was found in the Cut+Remove treatment in plots with a high forb species richness, indicating that the outcome of management practices depends on the environmental context. Clearing of treatment plots with many forb species also appeared to alter the phylogenetic composition of bee species assemblages, that is, more closely related species were found in the Cut and the Cut+Remove plots than in the Uncut plots. Synthesis and applications: Our experimental simulation of management practices in power line clearings influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of bee species assemblages. Frequent clearing and removal of the woody debris at low elevations with a high forb species richness can increase the value of power line clearings for solitary bees. It is therefore important for managers to consider the environmental context when designing habitat improvement schemes for solitary bees.","Bees and biodiversity and functional diversity and habitat management and phylogenetic diversity and pollinators and power line clearings and COMMUNITIES and POLLINATORS and RESTORATION and FRAMEWORK and RESPONSES and DECLINES and BRITAIN and TRAITS and PLANTS","10.1002/ece3.1963     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1963",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","power line clearings","Observational studies"
"214","rayyan-674259702","Consequences of grazer-induced vegetation transitions on ecosystem carbon storage in the tundra","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","1. Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored. 2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way. 3. At the site where relative reindeer numbers and trampling intensity had increased the most, graminoid-dominated vegetation was now also found in the moderately grazed area. At the other site, the dominant vegetation types under all grazing intensities were the same as 14 years earlier. 4. We show that the heavily grazed, graminoid-dominated areas stored less C above-ground than the lightly grazed, shrub-dominated areas. Yet, the below-ground consequences of grazing-induced grassification varied between the sites: Grazing did not alter organic soil C stocks at the site where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs were abundant in the lightly grazed area, whereas heavy grazing increased organic soil C stocks at the site where the deciduous shrub Betula nana was dominant. 5. Our results indicate that, despite the negative impacts of grazers on above-ground C storage, their impact on below-ground C may even be positive. We suggest that the site-specific responses of organic soil C stocks to grazing could be explained by the differences in vegetation under light grazing. This would imply that the replacement of deciduous shrubs by graminoids, as a consequence of grazing could be beneficial for C sequestration in tundra soils.","carbon stocks and grazing and herbivory and plant functional types and plant-soil interactions and Rangifer tarandus and reindeer and soil carbon and ARCTIC TUNDRA and LITTER DECOMPOSITION and ECOLOGICAL ROLE and SHRUB and REINDEER and SUMMER and RESPONSES and SEQUESTRATION and LANDSCAPE and EXCLUSION","10.1111/1365-2435.13029     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13029",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

These changes may further lead to depletion of genetic variation within populations as well as accelerating differentiation among populations. As a migratory species requiring large living areas, wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is highly vulnerable to human activity. The number and continued presence of wild reindeer have been significantly reduced due to accelerating anthropogenic habitat modifications, as well as displacement in benefit of domesticated herds of the species. As a basis for future management strategies we assess genetic structure and levels of genetic variation in Norwegian wild reindeer by analysing 12 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region in 21 management units with varying population sizes. Overall, both markers showed highly varying levels of genetic variation, with reduced variation in the smaller and more isolated populations. The microsatellite data indicated a relationship between population size and genetic variation. This relationship was positive and linear until a threshold for population size was reached at approximately 1500 reindeer. We found high levels of differentiation among most populations, indicating low levels of gene flow, but only a weak correlation between geographic and genetic distances. Our results imply that the genetic structure of Norwegian wild reindeer is mainly driven by recent colonization history, population size, as well as human-induced landscape fragmentation, restricting gene flow and leading to high levels of genetic drift.

The relationship between plant and pollen presences was quantified using association, over-and under-representation indices. Each taxon was related to its mode of pollination and characteristics of the flowers as well as to the size of its pollen grain. A pattern was found for anemophilous species and for species with open blossoms and numerous freely exposed anthers. These had the best association between the presence of the pollen and the plant. Their pollen was also found more often in the pollen assemblages than in the vegetation, and their pollen grain sizes are most often less than 40 mu m. Entomophilous species with few freely exposed anthers or concealed anthers were found to have a good association between plant and pollen presences or, most often, they were under-represented. Different pollen grain sizes are connected to this group. These results indicate that the presence of pollen of specialized entomophilous taxa and of pollen of taxa with open flowers, but few anthers reflect local occurrence in the vegetation. Their presence may therefore be important in interpreting land-use practices in pollen diagrams from soil profiles, whereas pollen percentages must be taken into account in interpreting the occurrence of pollen of anemophilous taxa and entomophilous taxa with open flowers and numerous exposed anthers from soil deposits.

But as plant functional traits and functional diversity underpin ecosystem dynamics, understanding drivers of functional diversity at biogeographical scales is essential to understand spatial variation in ecosystem characteristics, particularly in light of ongoing environmental changes. Here we investigate geographic patterns of functional diversity and -traits of the Norwegian flora. We explore whether climate, land-use or glacial history are important drivers of functional diversity. We combine species occurrence records and assemblage-means of functional traits to assess the spatial distribution of functional traits and -diversity of native vascular plants in Norway in a 20 × 20 km grid. We use multiple-model inference to identify which environmental factors contribute the most in explaining the spatial patterns of trait distributions and functional diversity. Additionally, we use the constructed models to predict potential changes in distributions of traits and functional diversity given different climate change scenarios. Both individual traits and functional diversity display clear geographic patterns, predictable by climate, landscape and glacial history. Traits related to plant size and growth peak in warmer areas and are predicted to increase in the future, as is functional richness and dispersion. In contrast, functional evenness peaks in northern regions and is predicted to decrease in the future. The different environmental drivers vary in degree of importance, effect sizes and -directions on the assemblage-averaged functional traits and -diversity. This underlines the importance of multiple drivers in determining plant assemblage functionality. In the face of climate- and land-use change, Norway is expected to become warmer, wetter and experience a substantial increase in anthropogenic land-uses, such as increased urbanisation. In turn, the functional composition of the Norwegian flora is predicted to shift towards tall, woody, fast-growing species. © 2022 The Authors.

Monitoring programmes often use remote sensing data and focus on changes in land cover/land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. Although a wide range of indicators is in use, landscape aesthetics is a topic that is frequently neglected. Our aim was to determine whether aspects of landscape content and configuration could be used as surrogate measures for visual landscape quality in monitoring programmes based on remote sensing. In this paper, we test whether map-derived indicators of landscape structure from the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes are correlated with visual landscape preferences. Two groups of people participated: (1) locals and (2) non-local students. Using the total dataset, we found significant positive correlations between preferences and spatial metrics, including number of land types, number of patches and land type diversity. In addition, preference scores were high where water was present within the mapped image area, even if the water itself was not visible in the images. When the dataset was split into two groups, we found no significant correlation between the preference scores of the students and locals. Whilst the student group preferred images portraying diverse and heterogeneous landscapes, neither diversity nor heterogeneity was correlated with the preference scores of the locals. We conclude that certain indicators based on spatial structure also have relevance in relation to landscape preferences in agricultural landscapes. However, the finding that different groups of people prefer different types of landscape underlines the need for care when interpreting indicator values. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In Norway, forest expansion is a major trend, with an increase in volume of 20.3% during the period 1994-2008. The annual increase has more than doubled since 1967. This study was carried out to gain more insight into the complexity of vegetation dynamics and alterations in a lowland area on the coast of W Norway, and to identify the driving forces behind these changes. Field surveys were carried out with aerial photo interpretation and vegetation mapping. Spatial analysis was carried out using GIS. Historical sources were identified, interpreted, and used to generate information on land-use during recent centuries. Supplementary methods consisted of soil profile analysis and dendrochronology. Climate data were used to analyse climatic trends in the past 90 years since 1923. Forest expansion was a major trend during 1956-1994. In 1956, 49.5% of the area was covered by forest, and by 1994 the coverage had increased with 53.4%. Forestation continued during 1994-2003 and 2003-2007, but at rates far lower than in the previous period (4.0 and 3.8% increases, compared to 53.4%). Forest expansion was most extensive during 1956-1994, a period with no clear trend in mean July temperatures. A distinct increase in mean July temperatures occurred during the period 1994-2003 and again in 2003-2007, when the rate of forestation was far lower than in previous decades. This is an indication that a factor other than climate change is the most important driving force for vegetation change, forest expansion in particular. Forestation did not start simultaneously throughout all parts of the study area, but at different times on different landholdings. Forestation initially started on plots where livestock grazing first came to an end (in the 1930s), and lastly on plots where grazing came to an end three decades later, in the 1960s. The different starting times of forestation is reflected in the present age structure of the forest stands on the eight landholdings studied. The conclusion is drawn that changes in land-use are the major driving force behind the distinct process of forestation that occurred during the 20th century.","Vegetables","10.3112/erdkunde.2011.04.02","https://doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2011.04.02",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Even-aged forest management, in which old, semi-natural forests are converted to clear-cuts and culturally regenerated stands, is expected to have pronounced impact on the abundance and composition of this group of animals due to changes in the understory vegetation. During a 39 year-period we sampled autumn numbers of small mammals in uncut, semi-natural old forest and in recent clearcuts, supplemented by a 7-year sample from middle-aged plantations. Field voles Microtus agrestis were almost exclusively trapped in clearcuts. Bank voles Myodes glareolus dominated in the old forest, but reached equal or higher densities than field voles in clearcuts. Here, their combined abundance exceeded that of bank voles in old forest. Some years, wood lemmings Myopus schisticolor contributed significantly to vole abundance in old forest.

Cruise ships make landings all around the archipelago, and there are numerous snowmobile, boat and hiking excursions. We describe disturbance effects on the three geese species that breed in Svalbard: the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the light-bellied brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). All three are regarded as highly vulnerable to disturbance. Behavioural responses by geese to humans on foot were analysed by estimating the distances at which geese become alerted, the escape flight distances and the length of escape flights, during pre-nesting, nesting and brood-rearing periods. We evaluate the consequences of human intrusion on the reproductive success in breeding colonies. During all three phases, pink-footed geese responded at longer ranges, and flew/ran longer distances, than both brent and barnacle geese: when disturbed on the nest site, both male and female pink-footed geese flew far away, resulting in a high rate of nest loss to avian predators (35%), compared with the 4 and 0% losses among barnacle and brent geese, respectively. During brood rearing, families of pink-footed geese escaped at an average distance of 1717 m, compared with distances of 620 and 330 m for brent and barnacle geese, respectively. Even though bird sanctuaries have been established on several islets, with no human access during nesting, many core areas for the three species remain without restrictions, such as islets used by brent geese and slopes and valleys with nesting pink-footed geese, brood-rearing areas and moulting grounds for non-breeding geese. We propose regulations of human access to goose concentration areas, and address the need to better protect these significant areas. We also discuss the need for further research on the vulnerability of geese to human activity.","Barnacle goose and brent goose and disturbance impact and pink-footed goose and recreational activities and tourism and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES and BRANTA LEUCOPSIS and DIETARY OVERLAP and HABITAT USE and BARNACLE and EXPLOITATION and INCUBATION and SUCCESS and Social Control, Informal and Social Control, Formal","10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation.

Therefore, these areas must be managed to maximize biodiversity and density of pollinating insects. We used DNA metabarcoding to study honeybee pollen resource use over time and space in the city of Oslo, Norway, and to assess the role of green infrastructure as a resource for pollinators and the services they generate. Urban honeybees used diverse pollen resources throughout their active season. There was considerable seasonal turnover in pollen resource use that reflected flowering phenology. Non-native plants (including invasive species) were an important resource early in the season but were replaced by native plants later in the season. Hive location was not strongly correlated with resource use, likely indicating effective long-distance foraging in the fragmented urban landscape. However, flower visitation rates and floral resource density in public urban green spaces were coupled to pollen use. Honeybees collected pollen from a small number of preferred species but also visited other species, likely for nectar. To preserve pollinator services, urban planning should consider flower resource management, with particular focus on planting native species that can act as early season resources for bees. Public campaigns and other incentive mechanisms to promote the cultivation of native plants that are resources for pollinators and the protection of urban semi-natural habitats have the potential to enhance the value of green infrastructure to support urban pollinators and pollination services. © 2023, The Author(s).","Citizen science and Flower resources and Pollen diversity and Pollination and Seasonality and Urban ecology and Urban green infrastructure and Seasons and Pollen","10.1007/s11252-023-01458-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-023-01458-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

A systematic review","Environmental Evidence","Background: Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion. Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested. Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species’ habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power. Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species’ response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia.

Interpreting the factors leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors. Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation data of biomass in the period 1957-2006, we were able to assess the transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957-2006. Only lichen biomass has been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The results presented in this paper show significant and positive relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer population in the period 1957-2006 in the study area. The hypothesis concerning the removal of the ""lichen barrier effect"" by heavy reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also, climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks, freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the period 1955-2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to the reduction of total net emission Of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover, reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Location: The mainland of Norway. Methods: We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results: Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness. The importance of land use and land-cover composition should be considered when planning management actions in extensively used high-latitude grasslands. © 2022 International Association for Vegetation Science.","3Q and Bayesian inference and grassland monitoring and grazing and plant community composition and richness patterns","10.1111/avsc.12647","https://doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12647",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems, Seminatural grasslands","Observational studies"

While the debate is multifaceted, a central issue concerns the ability of biodiversity to actually persist in shared' human-dominated landscapes. There is a widespread perception that large predators are synonymous with wilderness and have a low tolerance for human-modified landscapes. However, there is an increasing body of evidence that is questioning this paradigm. In order to explore the tolerance levels of Eurasian lynx to human activity, we have analysed data on 49 lynx home ranges in south-eastern Norway occupying a gradient of landscapes from near wilderness to the urban-forest interface. Our results indicate that lynx have the ability to tolerate relatively high levels of human presence both within their home ranges and within the immediate surroundings of their home ranges. Home-range orientations reflect preference for areas associated with low levels of human-induced habitat modification, and avoidance of the more heavily disturbed areas. The results show that lynx have a large potential to exist in shared landscapes if their presence is tolerated by people.","anthropogenic disturbance and carnivore and home range and human presence and lynx and Norway and tolerance and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and ROE DEER and SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION and SOUTHEASTERN NORWAY and HABITAT SUITABILITY and BROWN BEARS and SELECTION and LANDSCAPES and LIVESTOCK and DENSITY","10.1111/acv.12168     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/acv.12168",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Indicators of ES can be developed based on biophysical measures and be used to investigate the service flow from ecosystems to socio-ecological systems. However, the ES concept is multivariate and the use of normalized composite indicators reduces complexity and facilitates communication between science and policy. The aim of this study is to analyze how land use change affects ES and species richness and how the effects are modified by environmental factors by using composite indicators based on biophysical indicators. Using multivariate and regression analyses, we analyze the effect of grazing management abandonment in semi-natural grasslands in Norway on six ES: nutrient cycling, pollination, forage quality, aesthetics and global and regional climate regulation in addition to species richness along soil and climate gradients. Nutrient cycling, forage quality, regional climate regulation, aesthetics and species richness are larger in managed compared to abandoned grasslands. There are trade-offs among ES as different management strategies provide various ES and these trade-offs vary along environmental gradients. Management policies that aim to conserve ES need to have conservation goals that are context dependent, should recognize ES trade-offs and be adapted to local conditions.","Graciela Rusch and Alexander van Oudenhoven and Management strategies and abandonment and grazing and grassland and sheep and biodiversity and FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and ABANDONMENT and INDICATORS and TRAITS and CARBON and FRAMEWORK and DATABASE and SYSTEM and BEES","10.1080/26395916.2019.1644534     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2019.1644534",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11–25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6–10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments. © 2020 The Authors.

Since the 1950ties, such cultivation have been an important part of the agroecosystem in subalpine areas in Norway, and regularly practised. Today, several former leys are left for grazing management. Plant species diversity and heterogeneity was studied in subalpine grasslands in Valdres, southern Norway (ca. 950 m a.s.l.) at different successional phases after ploughing. Fourteen sites (100 m(2)) varying from recently ploughed grasslands (3-5 years at phase 1) to unploughed sites were used to construct a temporal gradient by a space for time substitution. Small-scale species diversity (0.25 m(2)) of vascular plants increased continuously with the time since last ploughing, while the variation in gamma-diversity was minor among late successional phases 3-5 (> 23-28 years, 32-39 years and unploughed sites) after an evident increase from phase 1-3. The number of exclusive species peaked within unploughed sites (10), and included perennial herbs (Antennaria alpina, Hieracium auricula, Viola canina), spore-producing species (Botrychium lunaria, Selaginella selaginoides) and woody life-forms. Species diversity of cryptogams was low at both a small and large scale within successional phases 1 and 2 (< 12 years). Small scale cryptogam diversity peaked at the unploughed sites, while gamma diversity peaked at phase 3 (23-28 years). This intermediate phase 3 also had the highest number of exclusive species (12) which exceeded unploughed sites (8). A coarse spatial structure of cryptogams at phase 3 was indicated by a low mean of species distribution. The soil of uncultivated grasslands (phase 5) was, at the end of the growing season (mid August), quite base-rich with a higher content for all measured nutrients as compared to intermediate phases of continuity (phase 3 and 4) The exception was nitrate which was not detectable from phase 3 to 5, and available phosphate which peaked at an intermediate phase of succession (phase 3 and 4). Heterogeneity of vascular plants reached a minimum value at the intermediate phase (3) while cryptogam heterogeneity peaked at this phase. Differences in heterogeneity cycles among these species groups implies that structuring processes act on different temporal scales for vascular plants as compered to cryptogams along the successional gradient in grasslands after ploughing. The importance of continuity in management for plant biodiversity in subalpine grasslands is finally discussed from a conservation point of view.","cryptogams and diversity and heterogeneity and land-use impact and semi-natural grasslands and vascular plants and SOIL FERTILITY and CONSERVATION and VEGETATION and LAND","10.1023/A:1009804509239     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009804509239",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, measuring grazing pressure is difficult. We seek combinations of herb species and morphological traits that serve as indicators of grazing pressure in alpine areas of Scandinavia. In a fully replicated, landscape-scale experiment with three replicates of each of three levels of sheep density (zero, low, and high), we measured grazing frequency (numbers of plants eaten, as a proportion), flowering frequency, and plant height for 17 common herb species for two consecutive grazing seasons. For eight species, grazing frequency varied significantly between treatments, and for four of these species there was additional strong between-year variation. The estimate for total grazing frequency of herbs decreased when more species of decreasing preference were included, and it was significantly lower in the second grazing season. There were large between-year differences in plant height probably related to weather patterns. A grazing treatment effect on plant height was found only for two species. Flowering frequency in selected species changed even at low sheep densities and was thus not considered suitable except for indicating ungrazed areas. Grazing frequency of three herbs, Saussurea virgaurea, Rumex acetosa, and Pyrola minor, provided a useful indicator of total grazing pressure, as these species were grazed only at high sheep density. Our study area is likely to be representative of alpine areas in southern Norway, but we advise careful calibration using monitoring procedures before similar management decisions on stocking rates can be fully implemented in other ecosystems.","flowering frequency and grazing frequency and herbivory and monitoring and selectivity and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and MANAGEMENT and POPULATIONS and GROWTH and DEER and HERBIVORY and RESPONSES and ECOLOGY and HEIGHT and MODEL and Sheep","10.2980/1195-6860(2006)13[459:SHSATA]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2980/1195-6860(2006)13[459:SHSATA]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

We aimed to deduce indicators for spatio-temporal landscape changes to draw scenarios for future protection perspectives of a RAMSAR and nature reserve. To estimate the variability of bird diversity, changes in vegetation patterns were analysed to predict bird occurrence. We obtained a differentiated analysis of present landscape dynamics by measuring landscape structure, vegetation, hydrology and nutrient concentration. Multivariate statistics were used to extract the main driving forces for changes in vegetation patterns out of a complex landscape ecological data set. Subsequently, we compared the measured data with those of past landscape stages to determine landscape changes and their mechanisms at different spatio-temporal scales. Ecological process indicators (EPI) were derived, and three different indicator constellations were used for scenario descriptions. These scenarios were chosen as to the current assumptions of typical contrasting nature protection strategies. Concluding, we used EPIs to evaluate nature protection aims and to assess scenarios of changing landscapes. This approach will be transferable to other examples of nature protection conflicts in the agricultural landscape in general. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss the possibility of mitigating such effects through establishing new spawning areas by addition of gravel. We monitored the occurrence of nests in seven gravel deposition sites in five different Norwegian rivers. The total area covered by each of the depositions spanned from 25 m 2 to 300 m(2). The areas were examined for nests during a 2-5 year period following the addition of gravel, that is, a total of 27 spawning periods. The fish were found to spawn at all localities and years with the exception of two occasions when gravel was lost during floods. Spawning success measured as egg survival was generally high (>80%). These results show that the additions met the criteria for successful spawning. Nests of Atlantic salmon were found to be aggregated in the area with the highest water current. However, successful nests were also found in areas with added gravel where the water current was much reduced. This unusual selection of spawring site most likely reflects the lack of other, more favourable spawning areas. The results therefore suggest that gravel additions can be successful even if the only available areas are suboptimal with respect to water flow and water depth. Three of the seven localities were unsuitable as the gravel was partly or totally displaced downstream during floods. At two of these localities, nests were probably lost because the floods occurred after the spawning season. This shows that large floods can be a major drawback. Monitoring of the spawning success and displacement of gravel is therefore essential to evaluate the method. Subsequently, stable areas, favoured by the spawners, can be expanded by supplementary addition of gravel. In sum, the results show that the careful addition of gravel areas can be used to provide suitable spawning locations for salmonids in regulated rivers.

The same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border. This can generate a source-sink dynamic from the areas with lower to those with higher mortality, a process known as compensatory immigration. We tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (Gulo o gulo) population of southern Scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: Sweden and Norway. Wolverines are fully protected in Sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in Norway. Using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture-recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. Wolverines in Norway experienced a lower survival than in Sweden. Migration across the national border was directed towards movements from Sweden to Norway. There was a functional relationship between harvest rate in Norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus confirming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. Contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efficiency of management actions. This calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management.

Treeline advance has implications for the climate system due to the impact of the transition from tundra to forest ecosystem on carbon (C) storage and albedo. Treeline advance has been seen to increase above-ground C stocks as low vegetation is replaced with trees but decrease organic soil C stocks as old carbon is decomposed. However, studies comparing across the treeline typically do not account for elevational variation within the ecotone. Here we sample ecosystem C stocks along an elevational gradient (970 to 1300 m), incorporating a large-scale and long-term livestock grazing experiment, in the southern Norwegian mountains. We investigate whether there are continuous or discontinuous changes in C storage across the treeline ecotone, and whether these are modulated by grazing. We find that vegetation C stock decreases with elevation, with a clear breakpoint between the forest line and treeline above which the vegetation C stock is constant. C stocks in organic surface horizons of the soil were higher above the treeline than in the forest, whereas C stocks in mineral soil horizons are unrelated to elevation. Total ecosystem C stocks also showed a discontinuous elevational pattern, increasing with elevation above the treeline (8 gm 2 per metre increase in elevation), but decreasing with elevation below the forest line (15 gm 2 per metre increase in elevation), such that ecosystem C storage reaches a minimum between the forest line and treeline. We did not find any effect of short-term (12 years) grazing on the elevational patterns. Our findings demonstrate that patterns of C storage across the treeline are complex, and should be taken account of when estimating ecosystem C storage with shifting treelines.","SHRUB EXPANSION and CLIMATE-CHANGE and FOREST and TUNDRA and RESPONSES and ADVANCE and STORAGE and SHIFTS and PLANTS","10.5194/bg-12-1615-2015     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1615-2015",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

To provide guidelines for the routing of new power lines and roads, it is essential to test whether linear features deter or attract movements of animals in different landscape settings. Using GPS relocation data from 151 moose (Alces alces L.) in central Norway, we tested for barrier and corridor effects of roads, power lines and rivers and accounted for forest cover, the topographical orientation of linear features and the placement of other nearby linear features. We predicted step selection probabilities for different movement options at varying distances from linear features and linear feature combinations. Barrier and corridor effects of linear features altered moose movements, although effects were minor compared to the effects of topography and forest cover. Moose did not avoid crossing power lines, unless the placement of power lines along contour lines impeded movements across them. In contrast, moose avoided crossing of roads and rivers in forests. Moose more likely moved along linear features when getting closer to linear features. Barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/river combinations compared to single linear features. Likewise, the barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/power line combinations, but not power line/river combinations compared to single linear features, when moose were close to the edge of those features. The inconsistent pattern could be due to the low sample size. We found indications of higher disturbance potential of roads compared to power lines and rivers. Managing vegetation in power line rights-of-way to provide abundant browse could counteract possible disturbance, while wildlife overpasses could mitigate road fragmentation effects.","Alces alces and barrier and corridor and moose and movement and Norway and power lines and rivers and roads and step selection function and RIGHTS-OF-WAY and HABITAT USE and ANIMAL MOVEMENT and RANGE USE and MIGRATION and BEHAVIOR and INFRASTRUCTURE and DISTURBANCE and SELECTION and COLLISIONS and Movement","10.1890/ES14-00278.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00278.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Our aim was to quantify edge effects on plant communities along such clearings in Norway and to identify factors that influence these edge effects. We surveyed understorey plant communities on either side of the power line clearing-forest edge at 51 sites, along four parallel transects at each site. Each transect had four plots located, respectively, in the clearing centre, clearing edge, forest edge and forest. We quantified the magnitude of edge effects (MEE) on either side by comparing edges with their corresponding non-edge' reference habitats. We also measured differences in species composition across the edge (clearing edge vs. forest edge). Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. Differences in species composition were greater between clearing centres and clearing edges than between forests and forest edges. Differences in species composition across the edge increased with edge contrast and forest productivity. Edge effects on species composition into the forest were smallest along north-facing edges, whereas those in the clearings increased with power line age. Species richness increased slightly towards the edge in forests but decreased considerably towards the edge in clearings. The direction and MEE on either side differed among functional groups. Edge contrast and edge aspect were the prime factors influencing the MEE into forests, whereas in clearings, these were influenced principally by tree regrowth in the clearings and by forest productivity.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects on plant communities bordering power line clearings were determined by factors that can be influenced by planners and managers. For existing power lines, management plans should differentiate between the following: (i) clearings through high conservation value forests, where edge effects into the adjacent forest should be limited; (ii) clearings that can act as replacement habitat for cultural landscape species, where maintaining open-canopy habitats should be prioritized; and (iii) business-as-usual' clearings, where continuing the current practice of cutting every 5-10years is recommended.

Fire has a long history in the management of this landscape, and its effect on various species groups has been investigated in previous studies. However, the resolution of these studies is generally rather coarse and is biased towards plants. In this study, we investigate the species diversity and composition of carabid beetles over a 22-year chronosequence of time since last fire in a coastal heathland in western Norway. We show that burning increases alpha species richness, and is particularly important for the richness of typical open habitat species. Our results also show that there are clear compositional differences between assemblages along the chronosequence, supporting the value for landscape scale biodiversity of rotational burning. Species richness is also increased by a higher species turnover between consecutive years in patches that have been burnt recently as compared to patches that have not been burnt for a long time. We conclude that burning is important in maintaining carabid diversity in anthropogenic heaths, and that prescribed burns should aim to create a mosaic of different burn years, preferably with a bias toward younger stages.","Succession and Fire and Ground beetle and Norway and Conservation and Scale and GROUND BEETLES and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and CONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY and UPLAND GRASSLANDS and CALLUNA-VULGARIS and PITFALL TRAPS and COLEOPTERA and MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and COMMUNITIES and Burns","10.1007/s10531-015-0945-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-015-0945-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, in the European context where human influence is pervasive, the conservation of lynx requires that they be integrated into the human-dominated landscape. Although previous studies have looked at how lynx respond to human land-use in a broad sense, they have failed to examine the details of how different types of human induced impacts (forest fragmentation, human density, different types of transport infrastructure) influence distinct lynx behaviors. Furthermore, they have not examined the extent to which lynx modify their fine scaled avoidance behavior of anthropogenic landscape features according to the specific behaviors (resting sites, kill sites, movement) in which they are engaged and how these relationships are modified by prey density or the sex of the lynx. We used Resource Selection Functions to examine how 19 GPS-marked lynx in southeastern Norway responded to an index of cumulative human habitat modification while engaged in different activities. We found that lynx select for areas with medium levels of human modification, avoiding both the very highly modified and the areas with low degrees of modification. Females in general appear to be less tolerant of human modification than males, especially when it comes to resting sites. Terrain (ruggedness and elevation) appears to be important in permitting lynx to exploit heavily modified areas. Our study demonstrates that lynx show a nuanced response to human habitat modification, which offers hope for their conservation in Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model includes the following: (1) a mechanistic representation of the spatial distribution of management practice; (2) management intensity, going from intensively to extensively managed; (3) gridded simulation of the carbon balance at ecosystem and farm scale; and (4) gridded simulation of N2O and CH4 emissions by fertilized grassland soils and livestock. The external drivers of the model are changing animal numbers, nitrogen fertilization and deposition, land-use change, and variable CO2 and climate. The carbon balance of European grassland (NBP) is estimated to be a net sink of 15 +/- 7gCm(-2)year(-1) during 1961-2010, equivalent to a 50-year continental cumulative soil carbon sequestration of 1.0 +/- 0.4PgC. At the farm scale, which includes both ecosystem CO2 fluxes and CO2 emissions from the digestion of harvested forage, the net C balance is roughly halved, down to a small sink, or nearly neutral flux of 8gCm(-2)year(-1). Adding CH4 and N2O emissions to net ecosystem exchange to define the ecosystem-scale GHG balance, we found that grasslands remain a net GHG sink of 19 +/- 10g C-CO2 equiv. m(-2)year(-1), because the CO2 sink offsets N2O and grazing animal CH4 emissions.

We analyze changes in ecosystem services such as habitat quality, sediment retention, water yield, carbon sequestration, crop and roundwood production between 2003 and 2018. The relationships between ecosystem services and the main influencing factors (temperature, precipitation, elevation, population, livestock, and land use change) are assessed by means of the Spearman's correlation coefficient and a new method that unravels synergies or tradeoffs at a grid level. Given the importance of forest management in the study region, an advanced land cover dataset that includes maps of forest harvest is produced and used as a basis for the analysis. Results show the large changes in ecosystem services during the study period and their spatial variations.

Given the importance of forest management in the study region, an advanced land cover dataset that includes maps of forest harvest is produced and used as a basis for the analysis. Results show the large changes in ecosystem services during the study period and their spatial variations. Overall, the habitat quality is decreased, especially in the sites affected by forest management and agricultural production. Water yield and sediment retention increased due to higher precipitation (mainly in Norway). Higher temperature and forest management have generally increased carbon sequestration and provisioning services. The relationship between ecosystem services and their potential influencing factors differs across space. There are 10 out of 15 pairs of ecosystem services that predominantly show a tradeoff relationship, while the rest shows a synergy. In general, our results show the importance to monitor ecosystem services and understand the main drivers of their changes, so to design more sustainable resource management strategies that can secure a long-term delivery of ecosystem services. © 2022 The Author(s)","Boreal forest and Climate change and Ecosystem services and Influencing factors and Synergies and tradeoffs and Denmark and Finland and Norway and Sweden and Carbon and Conservation and Ecosystems and Land use and Mergers and acquisitions and Boreal forests and Carbon sequestration and Habitat quality and Influencing factor and Nordic countries and Sediment retention and Sustainable ecosystems and Synergy and tradeoff and Water yield and boreal forest and climate change and ecosystem service and sustainable development and synergism and trade-off and Forestry","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109847","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109847",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland","Forest, Agricultural land","Observational studies"

In mountainous regions, we typically observe an uphill shift of species' altitudinal ranges caused by increasing temperatures, but it is difficult to predict how this process interacts with land-use change. Here, we replicated an inventory of bumblebees that took place in the 1960s in Norway. Focusing on subalpine areas, we reported changes in species richness and community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, at low and high altitude. Using aerial photographs and meteorological data, we tested the relationship between climate and land-cover changes and changes in species richness and CTI. We observed an overall increase in CTI consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. There was on average an increase in species richness at high altitudes, while low-altitudes communities tendedto become less species-rich. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between species richness and temperature and precipitation trends, suggesting a detrimental effect of climate change. Thanks to the replication of an historical inventory, we were able to show evidence for an effect of climate, and possibly land-cover, change on subalpine bumblebee assemblages. These results can contribute to a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity changes in subalpine areas in a context of global climate and landscape changes.","Bombus and Community shift and Climate change and Land-use change and Altitudinal shift and EXTINCTION DEBT and CHANGE IMPACTS and RANGE SHIFTS and RESPONSES and BIODIVERSITY and DIVERSITY and ABUNDANCE and PACKAGE and BIRDS and RISK","10.1007/s10531-018-1680-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-018-1680-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Grazing impacts on ecosystem services (ES) vary according to densities of sheep, but an ES framework accounting for these is lacking. We devised an experiment to evaluate synergies and trade-offs of ESs and components of biodiversity affected by sheep density at the alpine landscape scale in southern Norway. We examined the effects of increased (80 per km(2)), decreased (0 per km(2)) and maintained sheep densities (25 per km(2)) on 'supporting', 'regulating' and 'provisioning' services and biodiversity (plants, invertebrates and birds). Overall, I and biodiversity were highest at maintained sheep density. Regulating services, including carbon storage and habitat openness, were particularly favoured by maintained densities of sheep. There was no overall decline in ESs from maintained to increased sheep densities, but several services, such as runoff water quality, plant productivity and carbon storage, declined when grazing increased. Our study provides experimental evidence for a positive effect of grazing on ES, but only at maintained low sheep densities. By identifying ES and biodiversity components that are traded-off at decreased and increased grazing, our study also demonstrates some of the negative impacts on ecosystems that can occur in mountain regions if management does not regulate herbivore densities.","Herbivory and Ecosystem services and Livestock and Management and Optimal stocking levels and Overgrazing and Threshold and POSITIVE INTERACTIONS and ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS and GRAZING PRESSURE and CLIMATE-CHANGE and SHORT-TERM and LAND-USE and DIVERSITY and SOILS and INVERTEBRATES and HERBIVORES and Sheep","10.1016/j.baae.2016.06.003     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2016.06.003",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

This is the case particularly when individuals vary in their vulnerability to different causes of mortality due to traits, life history stages, or locations. Here, we estimated harvest and background (other cause) mortality of landlocked migratory salmonids over half a century. In doing so, we quantified among-individual variation in vulnerability to cause-specific mortality resulting from differences in body size and spawning location relative to a hydropower dam. We constructed a multistate mark–recapture model to estimate harvest and background mortality hazard rates as functions of a discrete state (spawning location) and an individual time-varying covariate (body size). We further accounted for among-year variation in mortality and migratory behaviour and fit the model to a unique 50-year time series of mark–recapture–recovery data on brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway. Harvest mortality was highest for intermediate-sized trout, and outweighed background mortality for most of the observed size range. Background mortality decreased with body size for trout spawning above the dam and increased for those spawning below. All vital rates varied substantially over time, but a trend was evident only in estimates of fishers' reporting rate, which decreased from over 50% to less than 10% throughout the study period. We highlight the importance of body size for cause-specific mortality and demonstrate how this can be estimated using a novel hazard rate parameterization for mark–recapture models. Our approach allows estimating effects of individual traits and environment on cause-specific mortality without confounding, and provides an intuitive way to estimate temporal patterns within and correlation among different mortality sources. © 2020 The Authors.

We studied habitat use of GPS-collared reindeer in relation to surface mining activities during the snow-free season in Finnmark, Norway over a period of 7 years. Based on information about the mine's level of operation (amount of people, vehicles, and equipment in operation) and rock blasting schedule, we divided data into high-activity periods (workdays) and low-activity periods (mine closed for ca 2.5 days on weekends and a yearly 3-week holiday period). We further divided workdays into periods with and without rock blasting and associated high-noise days. We found that reindeer significantly reduced habitat use at closer distances to the mine, indicating an influence zone up to 1.5 km. Reductions in use were strongest closest to the mine in high-activity periods. No avoidance effect of the mine was found beyond approximately 0.9 km for the 3-week holidays, 1.0 km for weekends, and 1.5 km for workdays with or without rock blasting. Compared to holidays and weekends, probability of use was reduced by 30-34% within 1.3 km from the mine for workday blasting periods, and up to 35% within 1.4 km for other workdays. Since averted areas can be partly utilized again within days or weeks following intensive mining activity periods, reduced mining activity in crucial periods for reindeer, such as during calving and migration, can be an effective mitigation measure.","Avoidance and Human disturbance and Mitigation and Reindeer and Surface mining and SEMI-DOMESTICATED REINDEER and POWER-LINES and SELECTION and TARANDUS and AVOIDANCE and ELK and INFRASTRUCTURE and PREDATION and DYNAMICS and WILDLIFE","10.1007/s00300-019-02563-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-019-02563-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Environmental impact assessments often fail to assess cumulative effects at larger spatial scales. In this respect, life cycle assessments are better suited, but have to date mainly focused on greenhouse gas emissions and energy accounting. Here, we adapt a recent global life-cycle impact assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate collision, disturbance and habitat loss impacts of onshore wind energy development on bird species richness in Norway. The advantage of a local model for Norway is that it enables employing species distribution models to more accurately estimate the potential distribution area of species. This facilitates more realistic site- and species-specific assessments of potential impacts within a local scale but excludes habitat ranges outside Norway. Furthermore, a new characterization factor was developed for potential barrier effects. Larger onshore wind-power plants overall had greater site-specific potentially disappeared fractions (PDF) of species, while smaller plants were less efficiently located with greater impacts per GWh. Overall, Norwegian wind-power plants were sited least efficiently (PDF/GWh) regarding indirect habitat loss (2.186 × 10−9) and disturbance (1.219 × 10−9), followed by direct habitat loss (0.932 × 10−9), and finally collisions (0.040 × 10−9) and barriers (0.310 × 10−9). Vulnerability differed among bird groups with seabirds, raptors and waterfowl emerging as the most impacted groups (e.g. 5.143 × 10−9, 3.409 × 10−9 and 3.139 × 10−9 PDF/GWh for disturbance, respectively); highlighting the sympatric distribution of their habitats and the majority of Norway's onshore wind-power plants. Current practice has not succeeded in avoiding sites with higher impacts for birds, fuelling conflicts surrounding environmental concerns of onshore wind energy development in Norway.

The relative magnitude of the conflict strongly depends on what prey selection patterns predators will adopt once established in a new area. We explored prey selection and kill rates from 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Southern Norway, between 2006 and 2011, using Global Positioning System collars. We recorded 603 lynx predation events on a wide range of prey species, ranging from passerines to large ungulates. During summer, domestic sheep were the most frequent prey, representing 64% of the ungulates killed, for an average kill rate of 8.2/100 days, whereas roe deer Capreolus capreolus were killed in about 33% of cases (kill rate = 4.2/100 days). In winter, when sheep were unavailable, roe deer were the most frequent prey, accounting for about 73% of the kills, for an average kill rate of 9.4/100 days, whereas red deer were found at 17% of the kill sites, corresponding to a kill rate of 2.2/100 days. Lynx-killed prey provided an average of 400 kg of meat per 100 days, irrespective of prey density. In both seasons, the proportion of each species killed by lynx was determined by the combined effect of all prey densities, so that the density of wild ungulates had the potential to affect the rate of depredation on sheep, to the same extent as the abundance of sheep could influence the kill rate on wild ungulates. Our results underline the complexity of carnivore–ungulate trophic interactions in multi-use landscapes where livestock and wildlife co-occur, and suggest that changes in densities of prey, predators or both may produce undesired outcomes, if such complexity is not taken into account during the decision-making process for management and conservation.",NA,"10.1111/jzo.12088","https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12088",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

We monitored red foxes for five years using 305 camera traps distributed across an 18000 km2 area. A total of 6581 fox events were examined to visually identify mange compatible lesions. We investigated factors associated with the occurrence of mange by using logistic models within a Bayesian framework, whereas the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease were analysed with space-time scan statistics. The apparent prevalence of the disease fluctuated over the study period with a mean of 3.15% and credible interval [1.25, 6.37], and our best logistic model explaining the presence of red foxes with mange-compatible lesions included time since the beginning of the study and the interaction between distance to settlement and season as explanatory variables. The scan analyses detected several potential clusters of the disease that varied in persistence and size, and the locations in the cluster with the highest probability were closer to human settlements than the other survey locations. Our results indicate that red foxes in an advanced stage of the disease are most likely found closer to human settlements during periods of low wild prey availability (winter).

Changes in herbivore density can affect the composition of plant communities. Management of herbivore densities could therefore be regulated to benefit plant species of conservation concern. In this study we use a unique spatial dataset of large herbivores in Norway to test whether herbivore density affects the distribution of rare red-listed plant species in tundra ecosystems, and to identify regions where herbivore density is the most important factor in determining the habitat suitability for the plant species. For all selected species a climatic variable was the most important determinant of the distribution, but herbivore density was an important determinant of some species notably Primula scandinavica. Herbivore density was the most important factor determining habitat suitability for this species in 13% of mainland Norway. Regions of Norway where the management of herbivore densities is most strongly linked to the habitat suitability of red-listed plant species are mapped. However, there was very low concordance in the localities of these areas; at any individual locality, habitat suitability was limited by herbivore density for only a small subset of the species. This suggests that management of herbivores for the benefit of rare plant species needs to be tailored for individual locations or species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, some of the habitat requirements of wild bees are met in anthropogenic landscape elements, such as road sides, power-line strips and field edges. Moreover, as the bee species assemblages change throughout the season the habitat requirements of the bee fauna may change accordingly. Understanding such seasonally distinct responses of solitary bees with different phenologies may be of high value for local conservation planning. The purpose of this study was to examine if the habitat quality of field edges for solitary bees change throughout the season, and how this temporal variation relates to local habitat and landscape conditions. By sampling solitary bees in 18 field edges in southeast Norway throughout the season we found that the species richness and abundance of bees was highest in sun exposed field edges, independently of the season. However, we found phenologically distinct responses to the landscape context. Moreover, field edges situated in landscapes with a high proportion of forests and semi-natural landscape elements hosted the most phenologically diverse bee species assemblages. We conclude that in order to fulfil the habitat requirements of bee species assemblages throughout the season, one should conserve and direct habitat restoration schemes towards increasing sun exposure at field edges with a diverse flora and a high proportion of semi-natural areas in the vicinity.","Landscape ecology and Solitary bees and Bee phenology and Bee conservation and Restoration ecology and OFFSPRING PRODUCTION and DIVERSITY and CONSERVATION and POLLINATORS and PATTERNS and HYMENOPTERA and PHYLOGENIES and INTENSITY and ABUNDANCE and DECLINES and Seasons","10.1007/s10531-014-0729-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-014-0729-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Agricultural land","Observational studies"

Dense mats of macrophytes can negatively affect activities like boating, fishing or hydropower production and one of the management measures often applied is mechanical removal. In this study, we analyzed the effect of mechanical macrophyte removal on phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrate (pelagic and benthic samples) assemblages. Our study covered five sites in four countries in Europe and Africa with highly variable characteristics. In all sites, dense mats of different macrophyte species (Juncus bulbosus in a river in Norway; a mix of native macrophytes in a German river, Elodea nuttallii in a lake in Germany, Ludwigia spp. In a French lake and Pontederia crassipes in a South African lake) are problematic and mechanical removal was applied. In every country, we repeated the same BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) design, including “before”, “one week after”, and “six weeks after” sampling in a control and an impact section. Repeating the same experimental design at all sites allowed us to disentangle common effects across all sites from site-specific effects. For each taxonomic group, we analyzed three structural and three functional parameters, which we combined in a scoring system. Overall, the removal of macrophytes negatively affected biodiversity, in particular of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate assemblages. In contrast, plant removal had positive effects on the phytoplankton assemblages. Effects were more pronounced one week after removal than six weeks after.

Therefore, legal regulations to limit supplemental feeding are often implemented when dealing with severe infectious diseases, such as chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. However, it is currently unclear whether these regulations result in decreased spatial clustering and aggregation as intended. Supplemental feeding is expected to restrict the movement of cervids. Therefore, a ban on feeding may also result in wider space use and a risk of geographic spread of disease. The space use of 63 GPS-marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) was investigated before (n = 34) and after (n = 29) the implementation of a legal regulation aimed at limiting the supplemental feeding of cervids during winter in a CWD-affected region of Nordfjella, Norway. Snow depth was the main determinant of the space use for red deer. A moderate reduction in the number of GPS positions in spatial clusters was evident during periods of deep snow once the ban was in place. Sizes of core areas (Kernel 50%), home ranges (Kernel 95%), and dispersion (MCP 100%, number of 1 km2 pixels visited per deer) declined from January to March and with increasing snow depth. Dispersion (number of 1 km2 pixels visited per deer) did not depend on snow depth after the ban, and red deer used larger areas when snow depth was high after the ban compared to before. The ban on supplementary feeding had no effect on size of core areas or home ranges. Several potential factors can explain the overall weak effect of the ban on space use, including the use of agricultural fields by red deer, other anthropogenic feeding, and landscape topography. This study highlights that snow depth is the main factor determining space use during winter, and it remains to be determined whether the moderate reduction in spatial clustering during deep snow after the ban was sufficient to lower the risk of disease transmission. © 2022, The Author(s).","Chronic wasting disease (CWD) and GPS and Home range and Implementation uncertainty and Spatial clustering and Wildlife diseases and Winter feeding","10.1007/s10344-022-01630-6","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-022-01630-6",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

Erosion rates are additionally affected by land use, which may change as a result of the shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to an economy relying on using renewable biomass, a “Bioeconomy”. In this study we aimed at investigating, through modelling, i) if future changes in land use, due to a bioeconomy, would increase the risk for soil loss and enhance suspended sediment yields in streams and ii) if these changes, when combined with climate change effects, would further aggravate suspended sediment conditions in a catchment. We used hydrological and bias adjusted climate models to compare the effect of seven land use pathways on discharge and sediment transport relative to a baseline scenario under present and future climate conditions. The study was carried out based on data from a small headwater stream, representative for cereal production areas of S-E Norway. By modelling our scenarios with the PERSiST and INCA-P models, we found that land use change had a greater influence on both future water discharge and sediment losses than a future climate. Changes from climate showed strongest differences on a seasonal basis. Out of the modelled land use pathways, a sustainable pathway manifested the least occurrence of extreme flood and sediment loss events under future climate; whereas a pathway geared towards self-sufficiency indicated the highest occurrence of such extreme events.

Microbial community composition was only affected by forest edge effects and not by forest density. We did not find any interaction effects between forest density and distance-to-edge. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were significantly more abundant in edges and Gram-negative bacteria more abundant in interiors, respectively. The microbial community composition was closely related to soil pH, soil potassium and nitrogen, texture (percent sand) and soil temperature. Soil pH was positively correlated with the saprotrophic fungi and potassium was positively correlated with Gram-negative bacteria but negatively correlated with Actinobacteria. In sum, we reveal the notable effects of forest edges on the soil AMF abundance.

Changes in acid rain deposition, climate, and catchment land use have increased lateral fluxes of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), resulting in a widespread browning of boreal freshwaters. This browning affects the aqueous communities and ecosystem processes, and boost emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. In this study, we predicted biotic saturation of GHGs in boreal lakes by using a set of chemical, hydrological, climate, and land use parameters. For this purpose, concentrations of GHGs and nutrients (organic C, -P, and -N) were determined in surface water samples from 73 lakes in south-eastern Norway covering wide ranges in DOM and nutrient concentrations, as well as catchment properties and land use. The spatial variation in saturation of each GHG is related to explanatory variables. Catchment characteristics (hydrological and climate parameters) such as lake size and summer precipitation, as well as NDVI, were key determinants when fitting GAM models for CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (explaining 71 and 54%, respectively), while summer precipitation and land use data were the best predictors for the N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O saturation, explaining almost 50% of deviance. Our results suggest that lake size, precipitation, and terrestrial primary production in the watershed control the saturation of GHG in boreal lakes. These predictions based on the 73-lake dataset was validated against an independent dataset from 46 lakes in the same region. Together, this provides an improved understanding of drivers and spatial variation in GHG saturation in boreal lakes across wide gradients of lake and catchment properties. The assessment highlights the need to incorporate multiple explanatory parameters in prediction models of GHGs for extrapolation across the boreal biome.</jats:p>",NA,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.880619","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.880619",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"
"297","rayyan-674232692","The efficacy of wildlife fences for keeping reindeer outside a chronic wasting disease risk area","Ecological Solutions and Evidence","Emerging wildlife diseases often comes with negative cultural and economic impact. Limiting disease spread is a recurrent goal and challenge, but the efficacy of various mitigation measures is rarely assessed. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal disease among cervids that was discovered among alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Nordfjella mountain range of Norway in 2016. After de-population, the entire range was fallowed to avoid re-emergence from environmental pathogen reservoirs. This involved installing perimeter fences in the alpine areas in order to keep reindeer from adjacent populations outside of the CWD risk area, while other cervids (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and moose Alces alces) were likely to enter through the forested areas. We used camera trapping and surveillance reports to assess the efficacy of the perimeter fences. All four species of cervids were documented inside the CWD risk area. For reindeer, only 12.0% of observations were inside the CWD risk area, while this was 28.7% for the other cervids. The higher proportion of observations outside of the fenced area indicate that fences provided a barrier and lowered the number of crossings also of red deer, roe deer and moose. Fences do not provide complete barriers, and we discuss practical solutions for how to avoid ‘intruders’ entering a given area, such as maintenance at critical points (e.g. river and road crossings) and height of fences (e.g. species variation in jumping; deep snow) to uphold their desired effect. We argue that two fence lines with a buffer zone would be required when re-introduction of reindeer are planned in the CWD risk area after fallowing, similar to what has been suggested for other wildlife diseases. © 2022 The Authors.

We focused on the period 1960 – 2017, that saw little change in the total area covered by forests in northern Europe. At the start of the period, rotational forestry practices began to diffuse, eventually replacing selective felling management systems as the most common management practice. Looking at data over the period we find that despite significant increases in timber and pulp wood harvests, the growth of the forest C stock accelerated.

"301","rayyan-674264749","Demographic consequences of harvesting: a case study from a small and isolated moose population","CLIMATE RESEARCH","Harvesting can have a substantial impact on population dynamics and individual performance in wild populations. While the direct consequences of harvest on individual survival and population growth rate are often apparent, harvesting can also have indirect and more subtle demographic consequences. Disentangling these consequences, however, requires in-depth knowledge of individual life histories of both females and males in the population. Here, we summarise demographic research on a population where such data exist: the Vega moose population in northern Norway. In this population, vital rates vary considerably among both females and males, and harvesting increases this variation by generating positive covariation between reproductive performance and survival. The skewed age and sex structure, which is typical of many harvested populations, also has demographic consequences: it reduces the ratio of effective to total population size and influences variation in vital rates in males and females. The moose harvest at Vega is structured by age- and sex-specific quotas, but it is not intentionally selective regarding size or other phenotypic characteristics. Still, harvest selection for earlier birth rates and larger calves was apparent, likely due to habitat-performance relationships and habitat-specific harvest mortality. Together, the bulk of research on this population shows that harvesting impacts population demography through many different pathways, with some being more subtle than others. These complex pathways influence the demographic variance and affect stochastic processes such as population growth, genetic drift, and rates of evolutionary change, and they must therefore be acknowledged in management plans to achieve sustainable harvesting.",NA,"10.3354/cr01650","https://doi.org/10.3354/cr01650",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

Hydropower can mobilize flexible energy on demand (hydropeaking) to balance out intermittent electricity from wind and photovoltaics. Adoption of hydropower as a peaking power source could lead to increased frequency of flow ramping in rivers downstream hydropower tailraces, which is one of the main stressors for riverine biota in alpine rivers. Both planned and accidental shutdowns of hydropower turbines need ecological mitigation. Our survey revealed that >3000 km of rivers downstream ca 800 hydropower plants in Norway may be ecologically impacted by non-natural flow fluctuations, and few have appropriate mitigation thresholds. A considerable eco-friendly peaking service may come from the Norwegian hydropower portfolio of over 19 GW installed capacity, with outlets into fjords, reservoirs or other large water bodies which normally dampen the ecological impacts of flow ramping. Intensive flow ramping occurs with irregular intervals from most types of hydropower. Although the highest frequency of stops were revealed in hydropower turbines not impacting river flow from storage hydropower, a significant number of turbine flow stops lasting over half a day in most types and categories of diversion hydropower. We suggest that further emerging ecosystem-based mitigations need to be adapted in hydropower licenses.

Fertilisation and increased removal of biomass have been proposed. But these and other forest practices may have undesirable effects on surface water quality. In naturally acid-sensitive areas such as much of Fennoscandia a concern is acidification due to acid deposition in combination with forest practices that increase the removal of base cations and leaching of nitrate (NO3). Here we apply the biogeochemical model MAGIC to the coniferous-forested catchment at Birkenes, southernmost Norway, to simulate the effects of forest fertilisation and harvest on soil and streamwater. The model was calibrated to the 40-year data for water quality, soil and vegetation and then used to simulate fertilisation and clearcutting of the mature forest by either conventional stem-only harvest (SOH) or whole-tree harvest (WTH). The 5–10-year pulse of NO3 following clearcut was larger with SOH than WTH. WTH causes larger acidification of surface water relative to SOH, due to greater depletion of base cations, N and C from the soil. The use of forestry as a climate mitigation measure should take into consideration the potential effects on soil and surface water quality. © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet the impact of natural enemies in CBC is often limited due to missing resources such as food, habitat, and hibernation shelters. Here, we studied a CBC strategy that incorporates these essential resources combined with semiochemicals, focusing on how the common green lacewing can enhance biological control of aphids. In a 4-year field study conducted at three locations in the region of East Norway, we developed a CBC strategy combining the three measures ATTRACT (a ternary attractant that increase lacewing egg laying), FOOD (floral buffer strips), and SHELTER (insect hotels for overwintering survival) to increase aphid biological control in spring barley. We recorded the number of lacewings, ladybirds, hoverflies, parasitized aphid mummies, and the two cereal aphid species Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Our CBC strategy resulted in a significant increase in lacewing activity and significant aphid suppression. At all three locations and over the 4-year period, aphid infestation was below the economic damage threshold in the field plots using CBC measures. In contrast, during two of the years, the density of the aphid infestation in the control plots was significantly above the damage threshold. We found evidence that use of the ternary attractant supported green lacewings but led to loss of ladybirds, hoverflies, and parasitoids, even though flower strips were used as alternative resources. Our study shows a promising increase in lacewing activity in the agricultural landscape and high biological control of aphids in barley. Long-term field studies are needed to evaluate the impact on non-target species and the agroecosystem before practical application of this approach can be considered.","Pheromones","10.1016/j.baae.2021.01.004","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2021.01.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Agriculture","Observational studies"

Various restoration and mitigation measures have been developed to improve ecological function, and among them is the addition of gravel to enhance the reproduction of gravel bed spawning fishes. However, information on long-term efficiency, costs, and maintenance needs of gravel additions are scarce. Here, we study the functioning of gravel additions at eight sites in three rivers in western Norway for up to 18 years. Gravel was added between 2002 and 2010 to enhance spawning of Atlantic salmon and anadromous Brown trout. We monitored changes in the size of the gravel-covered areas, sediment composition, interstitial oxygen, egg survival, and juvenile fish densities. Additionally, we report monetary costs, identify potential maintenance needs, and calculate a cost-benefit ratio. Juvenile densities of Atlantic salmon and Brown trout increased significantly after the gravel augmentations. After 10–18 years, the median egg survival was still high (&gt; 90%) and sediment conditions were still suitable for salmonid fish reproduction. The areas were, however, shrinking across time (median area reduction 26%), mostly caused by scouring of gravel in the steep, supply-limited, and partly regulated rivers.

Yet, few studies explore the gap between untouched tundra and messy megaproject from a historical perspective. Our paper focuses on Advent City as a case study of the emergence of coal mining in Svalbard (Norway) coupled with the onset of mining-related environmental change. After short but intensive human activity (1904-1908), the ecosystem had a century to respond, and we observe a lasting impact on the flora in particular. With interdisciplinary contributions from historical archaeology, archaeozoology, archaeobotany and botany, supplemented by stable isotope analysis, we examine 1) which human activities initially asserted pressure on the Arctic environment, 2) whether the miners at Advent City were ""eco-conscious,""for example whether they showed concern for the environment and 3) how the local ecosystem reacted after mine closure and site abandonment. Among the remains of typical mining infrastructure, we prioritised localities that revealed the subtleties of long-term anthropogenic impact. Significant pressure resulted from landscape modifications, the import of non-native animals and plants, hunting and fowling, and the indiscriminate disposal of waste material. Where it was possible to identify individual inhabitants, these shared an economic attitude of waste not, want not, but they did not hold the environment in high regard. Ground clearances, animal dung and waste dumps continue to have an effect after a hundred years. The anthropogenic interference with the fell field led to habitat creation, especially for vascular plants. The vegetation cover and biodiversity were high, but we recorded no exotic or threatened plant species. Impacted localities generally showed a reduction of the natural patchiness of plant communities, and highly eutrophic conditions were unsuitable for liverworts and lichens. Supplementary isotopic analysis of animal bones added data to the marine reservoir offset in Svalbard underlining the far-reaching potential of our multi-proxy approach. We conclude that although damaging human-environment interactions formerly took place at Advent City, these were limited and primarily left the visual impact of the ruins. The fell field is such a dynamic area that the subtle anthropogenic effects on the local tundra may soon be lost. The fauna and flora may not recover to what they were before the miners arrived, but they will continue to respond to new post-industrial circumstances. © The Author(s), 2021.

Roots are well known to improve the overall stability of slopes through hydro-mechanical reinforcement within the rooted zone. Vegetation-based solutions require the selection of species that are most suitable for specific locations, and they are aimed at restoring the natural state and function of river systems in support of biodiversity, flood management, and landscape development. Selecting a combination of different species along different zones of the riverbank can improve the conditions for the river system with regard to biodiversity and stability. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate how the combination of a variety of different plant species can improve the stability of the riverbank. This paper presents a methodological approach for slope stability modeling including vegetation as well as the results obtained from a series of slope stability calculations adopting the proposed methodology. The analyses were carried out for critical shallow (≤3 m deep) shear planes of ideal benchmark slopes covered with four different plant combinations—(i) only grass, (ii) grass and shrubs, (iii) only trees, and (iv) trees, shrubs, and grass—for species typically found along streams in southeastern Norway. In this desk study, two types of tree species were selected, namely Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens). The Goat willow (Salix caprea) was selected as a shrub, while a common mixed-grass was chosen as grass. Vegetation features were obtained from the literature. The methodology was used for two main cases: (1) considering only the mechanical contribution of vegetation and (2) considering both the hydrological and mechanical reinforcement of vegetation. The main outcome of the numerical modeling showed that the purely mechanical contribution of vegetation to slope stability could not be decoupled from the hydrological reinforcement in order to have a realistic assessment of the roots improvement to the stability. The most critical shear surfaces occurred below the rooted zone in all cases, and the best performance was obtained using the combinations including trees. Considering the typical climate conditions in Norway, the hydro-mechanical reinforcement was most effective in the spring and for combinations including low height vegetation (i.e., grass and shrubs). The study concludes that a mixed combination of vegetation (trees, shrubs, and grass) is the most suitable for reaching the highest hydro-mechanical reinforcement of streambanks, together with erosion protection and boosting the ecosystem biodiversity. The current study can help practitioners determine which vegetation cover combination is appropriate for improving the current stability of a streambank with restoration practices. © 2021 by the authors.

Beetle communities in managed southern boreal forests are less species rich than in natural and near-natural forest stands. In addition, many beetle species rely primarily on specific tree species. Yet, the associations between individual beetle species, forest management category, and tree species are seldom quantified, even for red-listed beetles. We compiled a beetle capture dataset from flight intercept traps placed on Norway spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus sp.), and Eurasian aspen (Populus tremulae) trees in 413 sites in mature managed forest, near-natural forest, and clear-cuts in southeastern Norway. We used joint species distribution models to estimate the strength of associations for 368 saproxylic beetle species (including 20 vulnerable, endangered, or critical red-listed species) for each forest management category and tree species. Tree species on which traps were mounted had the largest effect on beetle communities; oaks had the most highly associated beetle species, including most of the red-listed species, followed by Norway spruce and Eurasian aspen. Most beetle species were more likely to be captured in near-natural than in mature managed forest. Our estimated associations were compatible – for many species – with categorical classifications found in several existing databases of saproxylic beetle preferences. These quantitative beetle-habitat associations will improve future analyses that have typically relied on categorical classifications. Our results highlight the need to prioritize conservation of near-natural forests and oak trees in Scandinavia to protect the habitat of many red-listed species in particular. Furthermore, we underline the importance of carefully considering the species of trees on which traps are mounted in order to representatively sample beetle communities in forest stands. © 2021 The Author(s)","Coleoptera and Indicator species and Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) and Near-natural forest and Red-listed species and Saproxylic beetles and Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecosystems and Forestry and Organizations and Picea Abies and Traps and Trees and Norway and Scandinavia and Indicator indicator and Picea abies and Populus and Populus sp. and Quercus and Classification (of information) and Plants (botany) and Ecosystem services and Forest biodiversity and Habitat associations and Mature managed forests and Natural forest stands and Southern boreal forests and Species distribution models and beetle and boreal forest and community composition and coniferous tree and deciduous tree and decomposition and ecosystem service and forest ecosystem and forest management and stand structure and tree and Beetles","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119023","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119023",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

The loss of this vital habitat is resulting in a reduction of biodiversity, and this likely has consequences for ecosystem functioning, especially if functional diversity is reduced. A considerable amount of research has been done on predictors of beetle taxonomic diversity in veteran oaks, but predictors of functional diversity have remained largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to establish whether the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are related to functional diversity within three functional groups of beetles (decomposers, predators, and flower visitors) and determine whether species richness and functional diversity within the groups are dependent on the same predictors. Sampling was carried out intermittently between 2004 and 2011 on 61 veteran oaks in Southern Norway. Of the 876 beetle species that were collected, 359 were determined to be decomposers, 284 were predators, and 85 were flower visitors. Species richness and functional diversity in all groups were consistently higher in traps mounted on veteran oaks in forests than in open landscapes. However, additional predictors differed between groups, and for species richness and functional diversity. Decomposer species richness responded to tree vitality, while functional diversity responded to habitat connectivity, predator species richness responded to regrowth of shrubs while functional diversity responded to tree circumference, and flower visitor richness and functional diversity did not respond to any additional predictors. Previous studies have found that the features and surroundings of veteran oaks are important for conservation of taxonomic diversity, and the results from this study indicate that they are also important for functional diversity within multiple functional groups.","biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and coleoptera and functional diversity and invertebrate conservation and Quercus spp and saproxylic beetles and veteran trees and SAPROXYLIC BEETLES and FOREST MANAGEMENT and SPECIES RICHNESS and DEAD-WOOD and LAND-USE and TELL US and BIODIVERSITY and COMMUNITIES and TEMPERATURE and COLEOPTERA","10.1002/ece3.5940","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5940",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Modified landscape features, such as power-line clearings, may provide valuable habitats with increased floral resources for insect pollinators and solitary bees in particular. However, whether the effects of costly habitat interventions on bee communities in power-line clearings are sustained over time, is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment in 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was; 1) cut and left to decay, 2) cut and removed, or 3) uncut. We assessed the temporal effects of habitat interventions and environmental factors on species richness, abundance, functional groups of nesting preference, body size, tongue-length, and species composition. Species richness and abundance of solitary bees increased substantially with time in both the cleared treatments. But compared to leaving the woody debris to decay, woody debris removal more than doubled estimated bee richness and abundance in areas with a higher forb richness and increased the trait variation in areas with high functional trait variation of forbs, dead wood, and available source habitats. The positive effect of woody debris removal on the species and functional trait diversity of bees was sustained during three years post-treatment, but the effect was dependent on abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Over time the sites increasingly attracted bees from the regional species pool, showing how power-lines may benefit bee populations at a regional scale, through maintenance of temporary refugia in a forested landscape. The current routine practice (cut and left to decay) improves habitat quality for many bee species through alterations to early succession. However, our results indicate that the more costly woody debris removal is a more effective conservation measure for solitary bee communities over time and is to be recommended when funds are available. Removing the woody debris after routine maintenance clearing at specific sites may further enhance the diversity and persistence of bee populations over time, contributing to more diverse and stable bee communities.

Fragmentation by roads has had negative impacts on Fennoscandian alpine ecosystems, with reduction of habitats and connectivity for alpine species. Concurrently, infrastructure development causes influx of subsidies through roadkills and litter, which may facilitate expansion of boreal scavenging species, such as the red fox Vulpes vulpes, which may intensify negative interactions with alpine species. Hence, understanding the impact of subsidies within marginal alpine areas is imperative for successful conservation and management of particularly vulnerable alpine species. We used snow tracking and camera traps in three alpine tundra areas in Norway to investigate whether the presence of boreal scavengers was positively associated with highways during winter, and if this contrasted the pattern of a critically endangered alpine species, the Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus. In summer, artificial nests were used to assess whether predation risk was related to proximity to highways. During winter, the occurrence of red foxes was higher close to highways and decreased with increasing distance to highways, while the arctic fox showed no discernible pattern. Red fox occurrence increased with the number of edible items of anthropogenic origin located along highways, whereas arctic fox occurrence decreased. The overall predation risk of artificial nests during summer was high (>31.2%) and increased with proximity to the highway in the area with highest traffic volume. Synthesis and applications. Highways crossing alpine areas may attract boreal scavengers, possibly connected to increased access to subsidies of anthropogenic origin. Litter and food waste dominated available subsidies along highways in our study, and prevailing mitigating measures directed at reducing roadkill and movement restrictions may not be applicable to reduce negative effects of littering. We recommend actions focusing on informational campaigns, improved garbage disposal facilities and routines, and imposing fines for littering, to reduce negative impacts on vulnerable species.

However, the effects of landscape fragmentation on the pollination of wild plant species are not well understood yet, partly because there are many correlated features in fragmented landscapes (e.g., decreased patch size, increased isolation, and patch complexity) whose influences are difficult to disentangle. Using a structural equation modeling approach, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of landscape fragmentation (patch size, isolation and complexity, percentage of surrounding land in forest) on the abundance, functional-group richness, and evenness of pollinators of 24 habitat fragments within an agricultural landscape in Southern Norway. In addition, we studied how these variables affected visitation rates (visits per flower) and seed production (seed set, seed mass) in the four most abundant plant species in the area. Flower abundance was higher in larger and complex patches and decreased with the percentage of forest in the surroundings, while flower richness increased with patch complexity. We found a direct negative relationship between patch complexity and the overall number of pollinator visits that the habitat fragments received. Apart from this direct landscape effect, pollinator visits were mostly affected by the floral communities, with overall flower abundance and richness increasing both total number of pollinator visits and pollinator-group richness, and flower richness having an additional negative influence on pollinator-group evenness. Interestingly, we did not find any direct link between visitation rates and reproductive success for any of the study plant species. Instead, several landscape variables directly affected species seed production, although the effects of landscape on seed production were highly species specific. Patch complexity had a negative effect on seed production in two of the four focal species, while other components of the landscape had species-specific effects. Increasing fragmentation of agricultural landscapes affects pollination interactions at the community level and the reproduction of wild plants. However, understanding the effects of fragmentation on seed production requires going beyond estimating visitation rates, since landscape effects on plant reproduction are not always related to overall interaction frequencies. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","landscape composition and patch complexity and patch isolation and patch size and plant reproduction and pollinator evenness and pollinator richness and visitation rates and Ecosystem and Flowers and Norway and Pollination and Seeds and abundance estimation and agricultural land and complexity and flower and functional role and habitat fragmentation and plant-pollinator interaction and seed production and species richness and wild population and ecosystem and plant seed and pollination","10.1002/eap.2099","https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2099",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

One of the challenges for the species today is migration barriers that limit their habitat. Along the Norwegian coast, like in other countries, the abundance of eels appears to decrease with distance from the sea. This pattern may be a result of factors like water temperature, water quality, competition, and habitat suitability and availability. This study aims to use environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to investigate the potential relationship between migration barriers and the decreasing occurrence of eels in distance from the sea by the coast of southern Norway. Sixty locations with potential migration barriers are investigated by collecting water samples upstream and downstream from each construction before eDNA from each sample is isolated and analyzed by real-time PCR with specific primers and probes matching A. anguilla. The results reveal that the probability of detecting eel eDNA decreases significantly with number of hydroelectric power stations and their associated basins, even when the effect of distance to sea is accounted for. In addition, there is a clear border at which eel eDNA could no longer be detected upstream of the major watercourses. Therefore, it is likely that the migration of eels is prohibited by these constructions, which seem to constitute a much greater challenge than every other type of potential migration barrier investigated in this study. © 2020 The Author(s)","Anguilla Anguilla and Conservation and Environmental DNA and Passage barriers and Real-time PCR and DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase and DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase and DNA","10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01245","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01245",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

The present study compares restored heathland vegetation with unmanaged heathland at Kringsjå. The potential for activities is also analysed based on the proximity to the tourist attractions in the region. The Kringsjå area demonstrates different vegetation conditions depending on level of afforestation, Calluna heath maintenance, and gracing. Within a few minutes’ walk, dense Sitka spruce communities with desert-like forest floor may be compared to native forest floors, Calluna dominated heathland, and grazing fields. It turns out that Kringsjå may become a showcase for resuming prescribed burning and grazing for fire-safe rich landscapes, while offering cultural and historical experiences for all age groups. Moreover, tourism may become a source of income required for supporting ongoing restoration initiatives. To start working on a common vision, preferably aligned with existing ""Homeland of the Viking Kings"" tourism approach, should be one of the first steps along this path. © 2020 by the authors.

"321","rayyan-674260083","Disentangling the contributions of dispersal limitation, ecological drift, and ecological filtering to wild bee community assembly","ECOSPHERE","The species composition within communities is highly dependent on the rate of species immigration and whether immigrating species possess the functional traits required by the prevailing environmental conditions. Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species.","bees and community assembly and deterministic processes and dispersal and ecological drift and ecological filtering and functional traits and stochastic processes and FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY and LANDSCAPE CONTEXT and POLLINATOR and DIVERSIFICATION and BIODIVERSITY and BIOGEOGRAPHY and RESPONSES and DISTANCE and TRAITS and NICHES","10.1002/ecs2.1650     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1650",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Loss of farmland may have negative implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function and food production potential. The objectives of this study were to assess forage mass production and utilization, botanical composition, lamb performance, and grazing distribution pattern when reintroducing livestock grazing to an abandoned grassland. The study area was located in Central Norway, unmanaged for 12 years. Sheep grazed the area for 10 weeks in 2013 and 4 weeks in spring and autumn, respectively, in 2014 and 2015. During the summer of 2014 and 2015, the area was subjected to the following replicated treatments: (1) No grazing, (2) grazing with heifers, and (3) grazing with ewes and their offspring. The stocking rate was similar in the grazed treatments. Forage biomass production and animal intake were estimated using grazing exclosure cages and botanical composition by visual assessment. Effect on lamb performance was evaluated by live weight gain and slaughter traits in sheep subjected to three treatments: (1) Common farm procedure with summer range pasturing, (2) spring grazing period extended by 1 month on the abandoned grassland before summer range pasturing, and (3) spring and summer grazing on the abandoned grassland. Grazing distribution patterns were studied using GPS position collars on ewes. Total annual biomass production was on average 72% higher with summer grazing than without. Annual consumption and utilization was on average 218 g DM/m(2) and 70% when summer grazed, and 25g DM/m(2) and 18% without grazing, respectively. Botanical composition did not differ between treatments. Live weight gain was higher in lambs subjected to an extended spring grazing period (255 g/d) compared to common farm practice (228 g/d) and spring and summer grazing on the abandoned grassland (203 g/d), and carcass value was 14% higher in lambs on extended spring grazing compared to common farm practice. In autumn, sheep preferred to graze areas grazed by sheep during summer. Re-introduction of grazing stimulated forage production, and extended spring grazing improved performance in lambs. This study has quantified the value of abandoned grassland as a feed resource.","abandoned grassland and grazing and herbage production and herbage utilization and sheep performance and grazing pattern and carcass value and weight gain and FARMLAND ABANDONMENT and SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS and TRADE-OFFS and VEGETATION and EUROPE and MANAGEMENT and AVOIDANCE and MORTALITY and RESPONSES and PASTURES","10.3389/fenvs.2018.00033     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2018.00033",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Population density and species composition are both important determinants of these impacts. Large herbivore communities are shifting in many parts of the world driven by changes in livestock management and exploitation of wild populations. In this study, we analyse changes in large herbivore community structure over 66 years in Norway, with a focus on the contribution of wildlife and livestock. We calculate metabolic biomass of all large-herbivore species across the whole region between 1949 and 2015. Temporal and spatial patterns in herbivore community change are investigated and we test hypotheses that changes in wildlife biomass are driven by competition with livestock. We find that total herbivore biomass decreased from 1949 to a minimum in 1969 due to decreases in livestock biomass. Increasing wild herbivore populations lead to an increase in total herbivore biomass by 2009. Herbivore communities have thus reverted from a livestock dominated state in 1949 (2% of large herbivore metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species) to a state with roughly equal wildlife and livestock (48% of metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species). Declines in livestock biomass were a modest predictor of wildlife increases, suggesting that competition with livestock has not been a major limiting factor of wild herbivore populations over the past decades. Instead there was strong geographic variation in herbivore community change, with milder lowland regions becoming more dominated by wild species, but colder mountain and northern regions remaining dominated by livestock. Our findings indicate that there has been notable rewilding of herbivore communities and herbivore-ecosystem interactions in Norway, particularly in milder lowland regions. However, Norwegian herbivores remain mostly regulated by management, and our findings call for integrated management of wild and domestic herbivores.","WILD LARGE HERBIVORES and RED DEER and MANAGEMENT and CHALLENGES and LIVESTOCK and CONSERVATION and PERSPECTIVE and LANDSCAPES and MEGAFAUNA and UNGULATE","10.1371/journal.pone.0217166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217166",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Impacts of alternative flow regimes on smolt production were examined under different physical mitigation scenarios using the minimum flow regime recently proposed by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) as a baseline. Different combinations of hydropower operational strategies and/or physical mitigation measures were examined together with changes in the minimum discharge using a series of linked simulation models with the objective of finding combinations that both increased smolt production and maintained power production. This methodology provided a toolbox for predicting both the potential tradeoffs between smolt production and power production and therefore the evaluation of the most cost-effective environmental flow regime. The main finding was that it was possible to achieve a similar smolt production with a lower hydropower plant flow release (with consequent lower power loss) than the flow regime proposed by the NVE. Introducing habitat modification measures further reduced the need for release of water in relation to the proposed minimum flow, while increasing the smolt production. In an economic cost-benefit analysis perspective, benefits per smolt from recreational fishing were small compared to hydropower costs per smolt, with hydropower losses determining optimal flow. This study concludes that the use of a modeling-based methodology to define a targeted environmental flow can be used to successfully balance the sometimes conflicting requirements of effective management of salmon populations while maintaining hydropower production.","Energy production and Atlantic salmon production and Mitigation measures and Cost-effectiveness comparison and Fish benefit and Trade-offs analysis and HABITAT and HYDROPOWER and COSTS","10.1016/j.wre.2017.02.003     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2017.02.003",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Harvested wood products (HWP) represent a common widespread and cost-efficient opportunity for negative emissions. After harvest, a significant fraction of the wood remains stored in HWPs for a period that can vary from some months to many decades, whereas atmospheric carbon (C) is immediately sequestered by vegetation re-growth. This temporal mismatch between oxidation of HWPs and C uptake by vegetation generates a net sink that lasts over time. The role of temporary carbon storage in forest products has been analysed and debated in the scientific literature, but detailed bottomup studies mapping the fate of harvested materials and quantifying the associated emission profiles at national scales are rare. In this work, we quantify the net CO2 emissions and the temporary carbon storage in forest products in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the period 1960-2015, and investigate their correlation. We use a Chi square probability distribution to model the oxidation rate of C over time in HWPs, taking into consideration specific half-lives of each category of products. We model the forest regrowth and estimate the time-distributed C removal. We also integrate the specific HWP flows with an emission inventory database to quantify the associated life-cycle emissions of fossil CO2, CH4 and N2O. Results: We find that assuming an instantaneous oxidation of HWPs would overestimate emissions of about 1.18 billion t CO2 (cumulative values for the three countries over the period 1960-2015).We also find that about 40 years after 1960, the starting year of our analysis, are sufficient to detect signs of negative emissions. The total amount of net CO2 emissions achieved in 2015 are about -3.8 million t CO2, -27.9 t CO2 and -43.6 t CO2 in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, respectively.

Harvested wood products (HWP) represent a common widespread and cost-efficient opportunity for negative emissions. After harvest, a significant fraction of the wood remains stored in HWPs for a period that can vary from some months to many decades, whereas atmospheric carbon (C) is immediately sequestered by vegetation re-growth. This temporal mismatch between oxidation of HWPs and C uptake by vegetation generates a net sink that lasts over time. The role of temporary carbon storage in forest products has been analysed and debated in the scientific literature, but detailed bottomup studies mapping the fate of harvested materials and quantifying the associated emission profiles at national scales are rare. In this work, we quantify the net CO2 emissions and the temporary carbon storage in forest products in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the period 1960-2015, and investigate their correlation. We use a Chi square probability distribution to model the oxidation rate of C over time in HWPs, taking into consideration specific half-lives of each category of products. We model the forest regrowth and estimate the time-distributed C removal. We also integrate the specific HWP flows with an emission inventory database to quantify the associated life-cycle emissions of fossil CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The willow ptarmigan is a popular but red-listed small game species, and it is challenging for managers to optimize harvest levels based on uncertain population estimates and limited knowledge of the factors influencing hunting impact. We studied how willow ptarmigan hunting effort, catch per unit effort, and harvest rates were influenced by ptarmigan density, topography, vegetation, and infrastructure. Data were collected during 2013-2016 from 162 hunting blocks covering 26,828km(2) state-owned land in the counties Nordland and Troms, northern Norway. Hunting effort averaged 1.27days/km(2) (SD=2.08), and it was the highest in areas close to roads and cabins. We found an opposite effect on the catch per unit effort (CPUE, mean=0.77 ptarmigan/day, SD=0.48), which was lower close to roads. There was a marked positive effect of density on CPUE, whereas terrain steepness (slope) had a negative effect. On average, harvest removed <10% of the autumn population in the hunting areas during the study period. This indicates a relatively low and partially compensatory hunting mortality in most years and areas. Although this study shows a low harvest rate, we recommend managers to survey ptarmigan populations, hunting effort, and harvest, especially in easily accessible areas close to infrastructure and in periods of low population density.","Small game and Lagopus lagopus and CPUE and Hunting effort and Overharvest and Sustainability and FLUCTUATING POPULATIONS and NORTHERN BOBWHITE and ADDITIVE HARVEST and LAGOPUS-LAGOPUS and QUAIL ABUNDANCE and RUFFED GROUSE and HUNTER EFFORT and MORTALITY and REGULATIONS and STRATEGIES and Norway and Salix","10.1007/s10344-018-1208-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-018-1208-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

However, there are few previous studies of how patch size and isolation influence community composition. This study tested theory using small and isolated farmland patches in a forested matrix. Objectives I tested whether bird species diversity and community composition of isolated farmland patches depended on patch size, measures of isolation (e.g. distance from the main farmland areas; up to 15 km), and other variables such as presence of human habitation. Methods Farmland bird species diversity and community composition (relative proportions of different ecological guilds) of 130 farmland patches within forest landscapes were recorded in Norway. Results Species diversity and proportion of the species that nested on the ground or low in bushes increased with patch size. Distance from the main farmland region was not related to species diversity or community composition, but species diversity increased when there were stepping stones present. Sites inhabited by humans had higher species diversity, a larger proportion of species nesting high in trees or in cavities (such as in buildings), and a larger proportion of resident species. Other variables were less important. There was also a strong relationship between the occupancy of individual species in the main farmland region and their occupancy in the forest region, suggesting that colonisation pressure also influenced species diversity of these habitat islands. Conclusions I found weak evidence of isolation effects on bird species diversity and community composition of farmland patches within forest, whereas most of the variation was explained by patch size and presence of humans.","Bird community and Island biogeography and Habitat patches and Species diversity and Species traits and LEVEL PERCEPTUAL ABILITIES and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and REGIONAL ABUNDANCE and AREA and BIOGEOGRAPHY and DISPERSAL and MOVEMENTS and RESPONSES and MAMMALS and CONTEXT and Trees","10.1007/s10980-019-00920-w","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00920-w",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Quasi-observational studies"

To gain knowledge about visitors' motivations and spatial preferences, we carried out a survey of people (n = 498) on paths in part of Rondane National Park, Norway. The results indicate that a large share of the visitors in the central, vulnerable part of the National Park may find their desired recreational benefits in the less vulnerable fringe entrance areas.

Altogether, the study included 290 species of wood-inhabiting fungi. Comparisons of logs with similar properties (standardized tree species, decay class, dimension class) in natural and managed forests showed a significant reduction in species number per log in managed spruce forests, but not in managed pine forests. The species number per log in managed spruce forests was 10-55% lower than on logs from natural spruce forests. The reduction was strongest on logs of large dimensions. A comparison of 200-400 spruce logs from natural and managed forests showed a 25% reduction in species richness corresponding to a conservative loss of ca. 40 species on a regional scale. A closer inspection revealed that species confined to medium and very decayed spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests, whereas species on early decay classes and decay generalists were unaffected. Similarly, species preferring large spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests. Forest management had strongest impact on low-frequent species in the spruce forests (more than 50% reduction), whereas common species were modestly affected. Corticoid fungi were more adversely affected than polypore fungi. These results indicate that wood-decaying fungi in pine forests are more adapted to forest disturbances than spruce-associated species. Management measures securing a continuous supply of dead wood are more important in spruce forests than in pine forests.

Before management and stakeholders can make informed choices on potential mitigations, it is essential to understand how the hydropower reservoir ecosystems respond to water level regulation (WLR) impacts that are likely modified by the reservoirs' abiotic and biotic characteristics. Yet, most reservoir studies have been case-specific, which hampers large-scale planning, evaluation and mitigation actions across various reservoir ecosystems. Here, we investigated how the effect of the magnitude, frequency and duration of WLR on fish populations varies along environmental gradients. We used biomass, density, size, condition and maturation of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in Norwegian hydropower reservoirs as a measure of ecosystem response, and tested for interacting effects of WLR and lake morphometry, climatic conditions and fish community structure. Our results showed that environmental drivers modified the responses of brown trout populations to different WLR patterns. Specifically, brown trout biomass and density increased with WLR magnitude particularly in large and complex-shaped reservoirs, but the positive relationships were only evident in reservoirs with no other fish species. Moreover, increasing WLR frequency was associated with increased brown trout density but decreased condition of individuals within the populations. WLR duration had no significant impacts on brown trout, and the mean weight and maturation length of brown trout showed no significant response to any WLR metrics. Our study demonstrates that local environmental characteristics and the biotic community strongly modify the hydropower-induced WLR impacts on reservoir fishes and ecosystems, and that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions to mitigate environmental impacts. This knowledge is vital for sustainable planning, management and mitigation of hydropower operations that need to meet the increasing worldwide demand for both renewable energy and ecosystem services delivered by freshwaters.

The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state.","Climate gradients and Experimental perturbation and Linear effect models and Ordination analyses and Plant growth form and Revegetation and ARCTIC TUNDRA and SEED BANK and VEGETATION and RESILIENCE and COMMUNITIES and RECRUITMENT and RESISTANCE and TOLERANCE and DIVERSITY and STABILITY","10.1007/s11258-012-0094-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0094-5",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

To mitigate such impacts, it is essential to identify the proximate causes of such mesocarnivore releases. Here, we assess to what extent increased partial migration in semi-domesticated tundra reindeer induce a response in boreal and arctic mesocarnivores. We used a large-scale and multiyear quasi-experimental study design with camera traps deployed on coastal tundra peninsulas in northern Norway to estimate area occupancy of the whole carnivore community. These peninsulas represent summer pastures for separate semi-domestic reindeer herds that, owing to different degrees of partial migration, now display spatially and temporally variable densities of year-round resident reindeer. We estimated resident reindeer density by means of aerial surveys. Area occupancy of all the recorded carnivore species increased strongly when resident reindeer densities exceeded 15deerkm(-2).

Temporary land cover variations such as those related to forest management can contribute to climate change through both biogeochemical (carbon, warming) and biophysical (albedo, cooling) mechanisms. As global rising demand for biomass for energy and materials can contribute to biodiversity losses, there is an evident need for integrated assessments of climate and biodiversity impacts to investigate possible trade-offs and synergies. We explore the integration of impacts on climate change and biodiversity from forest harvest for three case studies based on forest plantations in Norway. We focus on impacts from land disturbance after clear-cutting using three plots of one ha each of homogeneous forest in two ecoregions in Norway involving three different tree species: spruce, pine and birch. We use existing ecoregion specific characterization factors (CFs) to quantify occupation, short-term and long-term transformation impacts of land use on biodiversity loss for five taxonomic groups: mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants at regional and global level. For climate change impacts, we quantify the contributions of CO2 fluxes and changes in albedo. We estimate CFs for two complementary climate metrics, namely global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP) for time horizons of 20 and 100 years and quantify impacts in CO2 equivalents. We pursue the integration of impacts on climate and biodiversity from a time perspective: very short (GVVP20 and land occupation), medium (GWP100 and land transformation within 100 years) and long (GTP100 and land transformation after 100 years). We find CFs from -0.21 to 1.6 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for carbon emissions, and from -0.03 to -1.4 kg CO2-eq./kg CO2 for albedo changes, while net characterized impacts range from -44.8 t CO2-eq./ha (GTP100, spruce) to 93.25 t CO2-eq./ha (GWP20, spruce). Damages to biodiversity range from 4.76 * 10(-13) to 6.24 *10(-8) global species eq. lost per ton of carbon harvested. Our results reinforce the notion that spatially and temporally explicit analyses are vital when assessing life-cycle impacts from land derived products. We show that the existing set of multiple and complementary indicators for climate charige and biodiversity impacts can be integrated into a common framework to better inform about the complex heterogeneities of the forest ecosystem response to disturbances. We argue for a more frequent consideration of integrated impacts on biodiversity and climate change from forestry operations to better highlight possible co-benefits or adverse side-effects of forest management strategies.","LCA and Climate change and Biodiversity loss and Forestry management and Albedo and GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIALS and LAND-USE IMPACTS and CARBON-DIOXIDE and SURFACE ALBEDO and CO2 EMISSIONS and CYCLE and LIFE and BIOMASS and BIOENERGY and TEMPERATURE and Norway and Trees","10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.02.034     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.02.034",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

In this study, we analysed effects of grazing intensity and abandonment on population dynamics of the semi-natural grassland species Knautia arvensis which is an important nectar source for pollinating species and an indicator of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We recorded life-history stage, survival, establishment of seedlings and ramets, number of inflorescences and grazing marks on permanently marked individuals in eight populations in mid-Norway for three consecutive years. Matrix modelling was used to estimate population growth rates and elasticities, and life Table response experiments (LTREs) were used to assess the contribution of different life-history components to the observed variation in population growth rates between different management treatments. Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effect of management on vital rates and number of inflorescences as well as damage to K. arvensis individuals. Populations in abandoned grasslands had more inflorescences, a lower proportion of seedlings and a higher proportion of flowering ramets compared to populations in grasslands under high grazing intensity. There were no differences in population growth rates between different grazing intensities. Fecundity however, contributed more to the growth rate in grazed grasslands compared to abandoned grasslands where clonal regeneration contributed the most. Survival of non-flowering rosettes made the largest impact to overall growth rates. Our results indicate that a long life-span and clonal growth buffer the effect of environmental change in abandoned grasslands and that there is a trade-off between fertility and clonal regeneration in K. arvensis populations.

Hunting activity may also reduce the access to food resources which may be limited in the wintering areas, thereby affecting winter survival. In this study we assessed the possible influence of food resources, weather conditions, inter-specific competition and hunting intensity (as a measure of possible disturbance) on abundance and distribution of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus at their main autumn stopover site in Norway. The results show that food resources in term of spilt cereal grain were abundant, even by the time the geese had moved on. Snow cover did not limit the food availability during the main migratory period. Inter-specific competition with greylag geese Anser anser reduced food supplies locally and appeared to be increasing. Goose hunting intensity varied among sites and our data indicate a negative relationship between hunting intensity and the rate at which geese consumed the food resources. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of pink-footed geese leave the stopover area earlier than they would otherwise, when hunting intensities are high. In the case of pink-footed geese, population consequences of disturbance is not a concern at present; however, an international species management plan calls for 1) keeping disturbance low in areas where geese do not cause conflicts with agriculture to prevent them being pushed to areas with problems, and 2) increased harvest to reduce and stabilise the population size. Both objectives can be met by reducing hunting disturbance in mid-Norway and it is recommended that a better local organisation of hunting is implemented.","HABITAT UTILIZATION and SNOW GEESE and LAND-USE and POPULATION and SURVIVAL and MIGRATION and DISTURBANCE and BIRDS and ENERGETICS and EXPANSION and Fibrinogen","10.2981/wlb.00161     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00161",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

Old, hollow oak trees, both in parks and in forests, were extremely rich in red-listed beetles, and hosted a high proportion of threatened species. The proportion of oak associated species and the mean number of red-listed beetle species per tree was similar in the two site types, but rarefaction showed that for a certain number of individuals, oaks in forests had more threatened and near-threatened species than oaks in parks. The species composition also differed between site types: Park oaks had a higher proportion of species associated with hollows and animal nests, whereas in forests, there was a higher proportion of species depending on dead oak wood in general. Four factors were significant in explaining the richness of red-listed beetles in our study: Tree circumference, cavity decay stage, proportion of oak in the surroundings, and coarse woody debris (CWD) in the surroundings. Forest oaks were smaller, but they still trapped a species richness comparable to that of the larger park oaks-probably a result of high amounts of CWD in the surroundings. We show that oaks in open landscapes and oaks in forest have only partly overlapping beetle assemblages and, thus, cannot be substituted in conservation. Planning for conservation of red-listed beetles associated with this key habitat demands a large scale perspective, both in space and time, as the surroundings have important effects on associated threatened and near threatened species.","Coleoptera and Beetles and Diversity and Red-listed species and Oak and Quercus and Cavity and Surroundings and Forest and Park and ENDANGERED LONGHORN BEETLE and EUROPEAN PRIMEVAL FORESTS and SAPROXYLIC BEETLES and OSMODERMA-EREMITA and TREE HOLLOWS and OLD OAKS and DIVERSITY and COLEOPTERA and SIZE","10.1007/s10531-009-9739-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-009-9739-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

The landscape-scale spatial distribution of herbivory in relation to diversionary feeding is relevant to wildlife and land management, yet has never been quantified. We considered multiple hypotheses, based on central-place foraging theory, to investigate how landscape-scale browsing impact changed as a function of distance from feeding stations and thereby test the effectiveness of diversionary feeding. We assessed the landscape-scale browsing impact of moose by quantifying browsing patterns and moose density in commercially-valuable young Scots pine stands in an area of South-East Norway with a long history of winter feeding. We also used positions from GPS-collared female moose to investigate the spatial distribution of individuals across the landscape. Moose density and browsing impact at the local spatial scale (<1 km) followed an exponential decrease with distance from diversionary feeding stations. However, at the landscape scale (1-10 km), browsing impact did not show any relationship with distance to feeding stations. Leader stem browsing on Scots pine trees was high at both the local (68 +/- 12%) and landscape (59 +/- 8%) scales. In addition, browsing on commercially valuable Norway spruce, which is normally avoided by moose, was locally high around feeding stations. Long-term diversionary feeding of moose is ineffective in diverting browsing impact from young pine stands at the landscape scale, as currently practiced. Browsing on commercially-important tree species was sufficiently high that economic consequences could be expected. To avoid further conflict, we suggest a combination of reducing moose density and increasing the availability of natural or higher quality supplementary forage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we use a nationwide network of 9400 plots in productive forest to analyze to what extent large-scale policy instruments, individually and together, target forest of high conservation value in Norway. We studied both instruments working through direct regulation; Strict Protection and Landscape Protection, and instruments working through management planning and voluntary schemes of forest certification; Wilderness Area and Mountain Forest. As forest of high conservation value (HCV-forest) we considered the extent of 12 Biodiversity Habitats and the extent of Old-Age Forest. We found that 22% of productive forest area contained Biodiversity Habitats. More than 70% of this area was not covered by any large-scale instruments. Mountain Forest covered 23%, while Strict Protection and Wilderness both covered 5% of the Biodiversity Habitat area. A total of 9% of productive forest area contained Old-Age Forest, and the relative coverage of the four instruments was similar as for Biodiversity Habitats. For all instruments, except Landscape Protection, the targeted areas contained significantly higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas not targeted by these instruments. Areas targeted by Strict Protection had higher proportions of HCV-forest than areas targeted by other instruments, except for areas targeted by Wilderness Area which showed similar proportions of Biodiversity Habitats. There was a substantial amount of spatial overlap between the policy tools, but no incremental conservation effect of overlapping instruments in terms of contributing to higher percentages of targeted HCV-forest. Our results reveal that although the current policy mix has an above average representation of forest of high conservation value, the targeting efficiency in terms of area overlap is limited. There is a need to improve forest conservation and a potential to cover this need by better targeting high conservation value areas.","NORTHERN EUROPE and BIODIVERSITY and WOOD and RETENTION and INVENTORY and Trees","10.1371/journal.pone.0115001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115001",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site, Rambjora, in western Norway encompasses the Rambjara Landscape Protected Area. We combined information from three sources recent alder swamp woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history to reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambjora in relation to land-use. Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland over 2800 years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment. The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, hay mowing, and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting) should be part of the future management in order to maintain the biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambjora. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys, pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when establishing conservation strategies.

Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of 9470 habitat patches, mapped according to the Complementary Habitat Inventory method (CHI habitats), as potential WKHs in 10 sample areas in Norway. We ask whether there are parts of the forest landscapes that have consistently low or high density of CHI habitats compared to the surveyed landscape as a whole, and therefore have a low or high degree of conflict with harvesting, respectively. We found that there was a general pattern of clumped distribution of CHI habitats at distances up to a few kilometres. Furthermore, results showed that most types of CHI habitats were approximately two to three times as common in the 25% steepest slopes, lowest altitudes and highest site indices. CHI habitats that are most common in old-growth forests were found at longer distances from roads, whereas habitats rich in deciduous trees were found at shorter distances from roads than expected. Both environmental factors and the history of human impact are needed to explain the spatial distribution of CHI habitats. The overrepresentation of WKHs in parts of the forest landscapes represents a good starting point to develop more efficient inventory methods.","woodland key habitats and spatial distribution and forest landscapes and forestry and steep terrain and productivity and distance to road and SPECIES-RICHNESS and CONIFEROUS FORESTS and BRYOPHYTES and INVENTORY and DIVERSITY and LICHENS and PLANTS and SCALE and Trees","10.3390/f7010011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3390/f7010011",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Hollow oaks (Quercus spp. L.) are well-defined patches that are hotspots for biodiversity and red-listed species, but they are often rare and fragmented in the landscape. We investigated the effect of patch size, habitat quality, and isolation on functional groups and red-listed saproxylic beetles in hollow oaks (n = 40) in Norway. The groups were defined by host tree association, trophic grouping, and red-listed status. Habitat quality, represented by tree form was most important in explaining species richness for most groups. Patch size, represented by circumference and amount of dead branches, was most important in explaining abundance. Isolation, that is single oaks compared with oaks in groups, had a negative effect on the abundance of beetles feeding both on wood and fungi (xylomycethopagous), as well as on species associated with broadleaved trees (oak semi-specialists), but did not affect species richness. This indicates that at this scale and in this landscape, isolated oaks are as species rich and valuable for conservation as other oaks, although some functional groups may be more vulnerable to isolation than others. The red-listed species only responded to patch size, indicating that oaks with large circumference and many dead branches are especially important for red-listed species and for conservation.","saproxylic and ancient tree and trophic group and fragmentation and Coleoptera and SPECIES RICHNESS and FOREST FRAGMENTATION and SAPROXYLIC BEETLES and OSMODERMA-EREMITA and TREE HOLLOWS and CONSERVATION and BUTTERFLIES and COLEOPTERA and MANAGEMENT and DISPERSAL","10.1093/jisesa/iev145     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/iev145",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Particularly in river systems, numerous dams and weirs hamper the movement of a wide variety of species. With the aim to preserve connectivity for fish, many barriers in river systems are equipped with fishways (also called fish passages or fish ladders). However, few fishways provide full connectivity. Here we hypothesized that restricted seasonal opening times of fishways can importantly reduce their effectiveness by interfering with the timing of fish migration, for both spring-and autumn-spawning species. We empirically tested our hypothesis, and discuss the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of affected migration timing. We analyzed movements of two salmonid fishes, spring-spawning European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and autumn-spawning brown trout (Salmo trutta), in Norway's two largest river systems. We compared their timing of upstream passage through four fishways collected over 28 years with the timing of fish movements in unfragmented river sections as monitored by radiotelemetry. Confirming our hypothesis, late opening of fishways delayed the migration of European grayling in spring, and early closure of fishways blocked migration for brown trout on their way to spawning locations during late autumn. We show in a theoretical framework how restricted opening times of fishways can induce shifts from migratory to resident behavior in potamodromous partial migration systems, and propose that this can induce density-dependent effects among fish accumulating in lower regions of rivers. Hence, fragmentation may not only directly affect the migratory individuals in the population, but may also have effects that cascade downstream and alter circumstances for resident fish. Fishway functionality is inadequate if there is a mismatch between natural fish movements and fishway opening times in the same river system, with ecological and possibly evolutionary consequences for fish populations.","Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and eco-evolutionary consequences and European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and fish passage functionality and life history strategy and salmonids and TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA and BROWN TROUT and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and CONSEQUENCES and CONNECTIVITY and EFFICIENCY and DENSITY and TACTICS and L.","10.1002/ece3.1937     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1937",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Despite decades of efforts, there is still no proper methodology on how to assess all aspects of impacts on biodiversity from land use and land use changes (LULUC) in life cycle analysis (LCA). A majority of LCA studies on land extensive activities still do not include LULUC. In this study, we test different approaches for assessing the impact of land use and land use change related to hydropower for use in LCA and introduce restoration cost as a new approach. We assessed four hydropower plant projects in planning phase (two upgrading plants with reservoir and two new run-of-river plants) in Southern Norway with comparable geography, biodiversity, and annual energy production capacity. LULUC was calculated for each habitat type, based on mapping of present and future land use, and was further allocated to energy production for each power plant. Three different approaches to assess land use impact were included: ecosystem scarcity/vulnerability, biogenic greenhouse gas (bGHG) emissions, and the cost of restoring affected habitats. Restoration cost represents a novel approach to LCA for measuring impact of LULUC. Overall, the three approaches give similar rankings of impacts: larger impact for small and new power plants and less for larger and expanding existing plants. Reservoirs caused a larger total area affected. Permanent infrastructure has a more similar absolute impact for run-of-river and reservoir-based hydropower, and consequently give relatively larger impact for smaller run-of-river hydropower. All approaches reveal impacts on wetland ecosystems as most important relative to other ecosystems. The methods used for all three approaches would benefit from higher resolution data on land use, habitats, and soil types. Total restoration cost is not accurate, due to uncertainty of offset ratios, but relative restoration costs may still be used to rank restoration alternatives and compare them to the costs of biodiversity offsets. The different approaches assess different aspects of land use impacts, but they all show large variation of impact between the studied hydropower plants, which shows the importance of including LULUC in LCA for hydropower projects. Improved data of total restoration cost (and cost accounting) are needed to implement this approach in future LCA.","Norway","10.1007/s11367-017-1263-5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-017-1263-5",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Agricultural intensification or land abandonment are commonly forwarded as key drivers. Several countries have established agri-environmental schemes (AES) to counter these negative trends among farmland birds. This paper reports a study of the relationship between land use and bird species in the agricultural landscape of Norway. The main objective was to investigate the effect of spatial heterogeneity and diversity of land use on total richness and abundance of farmland birds at a national level. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of birds is part of the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes. The monitoring programme is based on mapping of 1 x 1 km squares distributed across the entire agricultural landscape. Within these squares permanent observation points are established for bird monitoring. Detailed interpretation of aerial photographs provides the land classification. We tested the relationship between landscape metrics at different levels of land type detail and species richness and abundance of farmland and non-farmland birds. There was a positive relationship between species richness and abundance of farmland birds and agricultural area. For non-farmland birds the relationship was negative. Spatial heterogeneity of land use was a significant positive factor for both farmland and non -farmland species. High land type diversity was positive for farmland bird richness, but negative for abundance. Non -farmland bird richness was not affected by land type diversity, but abundance had a negative response. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of a spatial heterogeneous landscape. However, we also found that land type diversity could negatively affect the abundance of both farmland and non -farmland birds. Our findings suggest a need for different management approaches depending on whether the aim is increased species richness or abundance. Achieving both aims with the same means might be difficult. We thus suggest a need for land use analyses before proper management strategies can be implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, identification of habitat requirements essential for current species richness and abundance to persist is crucial. Hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are biodiversity hot spots for deadwood-dependent insect species, and the main objective of this paper was to test the effect of habitat history and current habitat distribution at various spatial scales on the associated beetle community. We used a gradient spanning 40 km from the coast to inland areas reflecting historical logging intensity (later and lower intensities inland) through 500 years in Southern Norway, to investigate whether the historical variation in oak density is influencing the structure of beetle communities in hollow oaks today. We trapped beetles in 32 hollow oaks along this gradient in forested and seminatural landscapes over two summers.

With many ungulate populations increasing across the northern hemisphere it is important to develop a general theory for how these animals can be expected to impact their habitats. Here we present the results of an 8-year experimental exclusion of moose (Alces alces) from 15 recent boreal forest clear-cut sites in Central Norway. We used standard univariate techniques to describe the treatment effect on multiple forest and soil properties and combined this with a multivariate Bayesian network structure learning approach to objectively assess the potential mechanistic pathways for indirect effects on soils and soil fertility. We found that excluding moose had predictable direct effects, such as increasing the ratio of deciduous to coniferous tree biomass and the canopy cover and decreasing soil bulk density and temperature. However, we found no treatment effects on any measures of soil processes or quality (decomposition, nitrogen availability, C/N ratio, pH, nutrient stocks), and furthermore, we found only limited evidence that the direct effects had cascading (indirect) effects on soils. These findings oppose the commonly held belief that moose exclusion will increase soil fertility, but still highlights the strong ability of moose to directly modify forested ecosystems.","Alces alces and cervid and boreal forest and herbivory and Norway and Bayesian network and nitrogen and availability and tea bag index and carbon stocks and MOOSE ALCES-ALCES and BELOW-GROUND COMMUNITIES and LITTER DECOMPOSITION and VERTEBRATE HERBIVORES and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and ISLE-ROYALE and NITROGEN and VEGETATION and DYNAMICS and CARBON","10.1007/s10021-017-0202-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0202-4",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

While traditional methods are often advocated, such practices may incur considerable costs and their effects have rarely been scientifically evaluated. We compared the communities of lichenized fungi, non-lichenized fungi, and bryophytes among equal number of coarse previously pollarded and unmanaged trees (n = 340). On 400 Ulmus glabra and 280 Fraxinus excelsior trees at 62 sites in Norway, we found 209 lichenized fungi, 128 non-lichenized fungi, and 115 bryophytes. Pollarded trees were richer in microhabitats than unmanaged trees and had significantly higher richness of bryophytes (ash) and non-lichenized fungi (ash and elm), the latter increasing with the availability of dead wood, cavities and coarse bark structure in pollarded trees. Further, the average total number of red-listed species, and red-listed lichenized fungi separately, were significantly higher on pollarded versus unmanaged trees, with diversity related to trunk circumference, depth of bark fissures and number of cavities. Our results underline the importance of microhabitats associated with old trees, but we cannot establish with certainty the importance of pollarding per se. Since we did not find any negative effect of canopy cover for community diversity, we assume that old trees with rich epiphytic communities can develop without management intervention. The high share (37 out of 49) of red-listed species occurring on unmanaged trees, and the fact that 11 red-listed species were found exclusively on unmanaged trees, may further indicate that unmanaged trees can with time replace the ancient pollarded trees as habitats for rich cryptogamic communities.","Temperate deciduous forest and Broad-leaf forest and Wood-decaying fungi and Bark-living fungi and Ecological restoration and EPIPHYTIC VEGETATION and FRAXINUS-EXCELSIOR and CONSERVATION and MANAGEMENT and FORESTS and QUALITY and TRUNKS and SIZE and AGE and Fungi and Trees","10.1007/s10531-017-1482-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1482-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

What are the possible mechanisms behind the observed changes, and how does nutrient limitation influence species diversity in these communities? LocationMethodsSOlendet Nature Reserve, central Norway. A full-factorial field experiment. Plots in two localities received one of following treatments (n=3): no nutrient addition (control), N, P, K, NP, NK, PK and NPK addition. Cover of plant species was recorded before treatment, and after two and 15years of treatment. ResultsConclusionsTwo years of nutrient addition caused small changes in species composition, but addition of NP led to large increase in abundance of species with high ability to exploit the added nutrientsa direct result of the elimination of nutrient limitation in the communities. After 15years of nutrient addition there were significant changes following three different pathways, one for each of N, P and NP addition. The addition of NP led to large community shifts, considerable species turnover and reduced species and functional richness, mainly caused by increase in cover of highly competitive and tussock-forming grasses like Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca ovina and Molinia caerulea, out-competing other species, especially bryophytes. Addition of N led to smaller changes in species turnover, and without clear dominant species. Addition of P led to considerable species turnover, but no reduction in species or functional richness, and the bryophyte diversity increased. This is explained by the bryophytes' association with N-fixing cyanobacteria, suggesting less N limitation and a greater ability to utilize the added P when vascular plants suffer from N shortage. In addition, bryophytes are more sensitive to low P availability, due to larger P requirements compared to vascular plants. There was no effect of K addition. Both N and P limitation is essential for the maintenance of high species diversity in boreal rich fens, and P limitation controls bryophyte diversity. From a management perspective, N and P limitation is vital in the conservation of boreal rich fens or when a functional fen system is reestablished through restoration measures.","Bryophyte diversity and Functional richness and Functional traits and Mycorrhizal associations and N fixation and Norway and Nutrient limitation and Rich fen vegetation and Sloping fen and Species diversity and LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS and FESTUCA-OVINA L and ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS and PHOSPHORUS MOBILIZATION and NITROGEN DEPOSITION and MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI and PERMUTATION TESTS and LIMITATION and DIVERSITY and COMMUNITIES","10.1111/jvs.12674     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12674",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Wetlands/peatlands","Observational studies"

However, susceptibility to fragmentation varies between species and may be influenced by for instance specialization, functional traits and trophic level. We examined how total and specialist species richness, species composition and functional trait composition at two trophic levels (vascular plants and sap-feeding hoppers) vary with habitat fragmentation (patch size and connectivity) in dry calcareous grasslands in southeast Norway. We found that fragmentation affected plant and hopper species composition both totally and of habitat specialists, but with a net species loss only for the specialists, indicating greater susceptibility of specialized species. Reductions in patch size and increasing isolation negatively affected plant specialists with different sets of traits, effectively reducing the number of species with trait combinations suitable to persist in small and isolated patches. Fragmentation influenced trait composition of the total hopper community, but not of habitat specialists. A lesser degree of habitat association could explain why hoppers, despite belonging to a higher tropic level, seemed to be less susceptible to fragmentation than plants. Nonetheless, our study shows that habitat fragmentation affects both species richness, species composition and trait composition of plants and hoppers, indicating that fragmentation leads not only to a loss of species, but also alters dominance hierarchies and the functionality of grassland communities.","Calcareous grasslands and Functional traits and Habitat fragmentation and Auchenorrhyncha and Vascular plants and LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION and EXTINCTION DEBT and PLANT DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and AREA and RESPONSES and CONNECTIVITY and RICHNESS","10.1007/s10531-018-1540-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-018-1540-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Understanding which mechanisms regulate genetic diversity of riverine fish can therefore advance current conservation strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate how habitat fragmentation interacted with population genetic diversity and individual behaviour of freshwater fish in large river systems. We studied a population of the long-distance migratory, iteroparous freshwater salmonid European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in south-eastern Norway. Genotyping (n = 527) and radio-tracking (n = 54) of adult fish throughout a 169-km river section revealed three major migration barriers limiting gene flow and depleting genetic diversity upstream. Individuals from upstream areas that had dispersed downstream of barriers showed different movement behaviour than local genotypes. No natal philopatry was found in a large unfragmented river section, in contrast to strong fidelity to spawning tributaries known for individuals overwintering in lakes. We conclude that (a) upstream sub-populations in fragmented rivers show less genetic variation, making it less likely for them to adapt to environmental changes; (b) fish with distinct genotypes in the same habitat can differ in their behaviour; (c) spawning site selection (natal philopatry) can differ between fish of the same species living in different habitats. Together this implies that habitat loss and fragmentation may differently affect individual fish of the same species if they live in different types or sections of habitat. Studying behaviour and genetic diversity of fish can unravel their complex ecology and help minimize human impact.","barriers and dams and weirs and natal philopatry and radiotelemetry and spawning site fidelity and Thymallus thymallus and GRAYLING THYMALLUS-THYMALLUS and RE-IMPLEMENTATION and F-STATISTICS and LIFE-HISTORY and DIFFERENTIATION and FLOW and DIVERGENCE and SOFTWARE and CONSERVATION and TEMPERATURE and Genetic Variation","10.1002/rra.3226     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3226",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended.","boreal forests and conservation and ecosystem functions and ecosystem services and effect traits and land use and management and plant communities and CONSERVATION VALUE and WILD BEES and COMMUNITIES and TRAITS and MANAGEMENT and FRAMEWORK and RESPONSES and HABITAT and BIODIVERSITY and GRASSLAND","10.1002/ecs2.2509     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2509",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Preservation of remaining natural genetic diversity is crucial to avoid continued genetic erosion. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is an ideal model species for studying anthropogenic influences on genetic integrity, as it has experienced significant genetic alterations throughout its natural distribution range due to habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, translocations, and stocking. The Pasvik River is a subarctic riverine system shared between Norway, Russia, and Finland, subdivided by seven hydroelectric power dams that destroyed about 70% of natural spawning and nursing areas. Stocking is applied in certain river parts to support the natural brown trout population. Adjacent river segments with different management strategies (stocked vs. not stocked) facilitated the simultaneous assessment of genetic impacts of dams and stocking based on analyses of 16 short tandem repeat loci. Dams were expected to increase genetic differentiation between and reduce genetic diversity within river sections. Contrastingly, stocking was predicted to promote genetic homogenization and diversity, but also potentially lead to loss of private alleles and to genetic erosion. Our results showed comparatively low heterozygosity and clear genetic differentiation between adjacent sections in nonstocked river parts, indicating that dams prevent migration and contribute to genetic isolation and loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was low and heterozygosity relatively high across stocked sections. However, in stocked river sections, we found signatures of recent bottlenecks and reductions in private alleles, indicating that only a subset of individuals contributes to reproduction, potentially leading to divergence away from the natural genetic state. Taken together, these results indicate that stocking counteracts the negative fragmentation effects of dams, but also that stocking practices should be planned carefully in order to ensure long-term preservation of natural genetic diversity and integrity in brown trout and other species in regulated river systems.","fish stocking and genetic diversity and genetic erosion and genetic integrity and habitat fragmentation and Salmo trutta and SCALE POPULATION-STRUCTURE and SALMO-TRUTTA L. and DENDRITIC CONNECTIVITY and SPATIAL-PATTERNS and SALAR L. and STOCKING and MICROSATELLITE and DIVERSITY and FRAGMENTATION and SOFTWARE","10.1002/ece3.5191     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5191",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of “adaptive management”, where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway’s Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK – which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.","Norway","10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.063","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.063",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In this context, social learning is valuable to inform stakeholders of the efficacy of riparian vegetation in mitigating stream degradation. We aim to develop a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for application as a learning tool to simulate and assess the reach- and segment-scale effects of riparian vegetation properties and land use on instream invertebrates. We surveyed reach-scale riparian conditions, extracted segment-scale riparian and subcatchment land use information from geographic information system data, and collected macroinvertebrate samples from four catchments in Europe (Belgium, Norway, Romania, and Sweden). We modelled the ecological condition based on the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index, a macroinvertebrate-based index widely used in European bioassessment, as a function of different riparian variables using the BBN modelling approach. The results of the model simulations provided insights into the usefulness of riparian vegetation attributes in enhancing the ecological condition, with reach-scale riparian vegetation quality associated with the strongest improvements in ecological status. Specifically, reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 3 (i.e. moderate quality) generally results in the highest probability of a good ASPT score (99–100%). In contrast, a site with a narrow width of riparian trees and a small area of trees with reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 1 (i.e. low quality) predicts a high probability of a bad ASPT score (74%).

A conflict over restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised comprehensive local debate.

The degree of compliance with biodiversity measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001 and the Norwegian standard ""Living Forests'') was compared in a field study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21% of the postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41% had either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road transport, little improvement was seen.

To maintain the biodiversity of hay meadows, it is important to understand local management regimes and the land use history that has shaped them and their biodiversity. There is however a general erosion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), related to hay meadows and other semi-natural habitats. This review aims to examine historical and written sources of land use practices related to hay meadows and to discuss the implications of a reintroduction of TEK in present and future management practices. Traditional land use practices and TEK obtained from written sources from four Norwegian regions and for the country as a whole are compared with present management practices. Written sources show that hay meadows have been managed in a complex but flexible way. Today's management regimes of hay meadows in Norway are streamlined and strongly simplified, most often involving only one late mowing and in some cases grazing. This simplification may result in loss of biodiversity. The potential to include more variety of management practices in hay meadows, by utilizing knowledge from written sources more systematically in combination with farmers' experienced knowledge (TEK) should be better utilized. Such an approach may secure both the biodiversity in hay meadows and TEK for the future. Former and present landscape ecological contexts in the infield-outlying land system show that management should be done for larger landscapes rather than small, isolated hay meadows, to optimize biodiversity conservation. For this study, we conducted a Norwegian literature review, based on ethnographical and ethnobotanical sources, as well as historical and present agricultural statistics, historical maps, results from research projects, and other sources. Our findings are discussed with similar European studies focusing on the historical management of hay meadows.","Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Management practices and Biodiversity and Land use and Semi-natural grassland and History and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE and CENTRAL-EUROPE and GRASSLAND and MANAGEMENT and LANDSCAPE and HISTORY and DIVERSITY and SWEDISH and HETEROGENEITY and Norway and Learning","10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126510","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126510",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Classification of ecological status and identifying the stressors impacting aquatic habitats is essential for achieving this aim. Here, we evaluate different methods and indices for assessing ecological status in a hydropower-regulated river in central Norway using kick-sampling and macroinvertebrate identification through morphology and DNA as well as using environmental DNA. In Norway, the ASPT index (Average Score Per Taxon) is commonly used to evaluate ecological condition in general, although the index only provides evidence for organic pollution. We observed lower than expected diversity in the regulated river, but this was not reflected in the ASPT index, which showed “Good” to “High” status for all samples and methods. An alternative index, the IBIBI (Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index), returned “Bad” to “Moderate” status using the same data. The DNA-based identification methods returned in general higher species richness and somewhat higher index values than morphological species identification did. Our study exemplifies the importance of including relevant biological quality indices in WFD compliant assessments, and we advocate inclusion of a pressure-independent index like IBIBI in Norwegian river management and DNA-based identification methods for future river management in general. © 2024, The Author(s).","Benthic macroinvertebrates and Community composition and DNA metabarcoding and eDNA and River management","10.1007/s10750-023-05448-4","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05448-4",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Reindeer pastures are exposed to the development of infrastructure, hydropower, mineral exploration, recreational cabin areas, and wind power. Land use conflicts are exacerbated under climate policy with wind power plants in reindeer herding areas. Projected developments and climate change impacts challenge the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders and the resilience of reindeer herding. Analysis of biodiversity loss by the GLOBIO3 model is suggested as tool for decision support, in consultation with Sámi reindeer owners, taking into account traditional knowledge of reindeer herding. GLOBIO3 analysis for Sámi reindeer herding land in Finnmark indicates that in 2011, compared to an intact situation, about 50% of the biodiversity of reindeer calving grounds has been lost, and it is expected to be reduced with another 10% in the scenario for 2030. Reindeer owners in Finnmark told that they expect biodiversity loss will have implications for the quality and extent of suitable grazing areas. Especially the quality of the calving grounds is essential for reindeer herding. An important lesson from dialogue with reindeer owners is that even highly impacted areas should not be considered as lost, and thus be opened to further development, as they are still important for seasonal reindeer migration and grazing at certain times of the year. The chapter presents research on methods development, traditional knowledge in the context of Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark and highlights innovative tools to engage rightsholders and stakeholders in the Arctic in development planning processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","GLOBIO3 model and Reindeer herding and Sámi traditional knowledge and Norway","10.1007/978-3-031-17625-8_9","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-17625-8_9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Using a new indicator quantifying the loss of functional habitat (habitat that is simultaneously suitable and well-connected), we show that the real impact of renewable energy is far larger than previously assumed. Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km<sup>2</sup> of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km<sup>2</sup>). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km<sup>2</sup>) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs.

Young People's Responses to the Conflicts over Large Carnivores in Eastern Norway.","Rural Sociology","Controversies over large carnivores are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural com- munities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modern- ization will increase the diversity. To probe such diverse and changing at- titudes towards nature, I conducted a qualitative study of young people in a rural community in eastern Norway. Contrary to popular images of such communities as unified against ""pests,"" all typical views of the car- nivore issue were present. Those in favor of the large carnivores were typically middle-class youths with a strong ""outward"" orientation, while those who wanted to shoot the predators were mostly working-class boys with strong ties to the local hunting culture. This pattern was interpreted as a conflict between dominant and subordinate forms of knowledge, and between abstraction-oriented and production-oriented cultural forms. Aside from the growth of the pro-carnivore middle-class seg- ments, the most significant effect of modernization appeared to be the removal of many young people from the subject matter of the conflict. A ""subculturalization"" of the working-class hunting culture also could be discerned, however. After decades of protection, the four species of large carnivores found in mainland Norway (brown bear, lynx, wolverine, and wolf) are now slowly recovering from the brink of extinction. This development is applauded by environmentalists, managers, biolo- gists, and many politicians. Opinion polls also indicate enthusiasm in a majority of the general population. Increasing carnivore populations have spurred fierce conflicts, however. Livestock depredation and competition for huntable game are key issues, but the killing of hunting dogs and the possibility of attacks on people also feature in the controversies. In the public debate it is often suggested that this is a conflict representing a clash between old and new perspectives on nature, or rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Whereas this seems to touch some core issues, we know little about the operative mechanisms. In particular, we know little of how young people are handling such issues.

It focuses on nature conservation, which is vital both to maintain nature's ability to store carbon and to preserve ecosystems, as key aspects of the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The paper analyses the perceptions of local, regional and state stakeholders relating to four rural municipalities following diverging land-use trajectories. We find land policy in all four cases to be highly entangled with strategies to achieve growth in terms of income, job creation and population. When nature conservation was not in line with wider economic or social considerations, it was less integrated into land-policy practices. In three of the municipalities, the construction of residential units, holiday-homes or renewable energy parks was prioritized over the preservation of nature areas or cultural landscapes. One case presented a contrasting trajectory, as it involved a clear alignment between nature conservation and economic growth. Here, conservation was considered a key strategy to both sustain the traditional fishery industry and to accommodate the growing tourism. However, while this municipality's restrictive land use was based on a nature conservation understanding, it was also connected to the greenhouse-gas emissions, resource exhaustion and waste generation traditionally associated with international tourism. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of rural municipalities being equipped with sufficient resources if they are to prioritize environmental concerns over the economic and social dimensions of sustainability in their land-use management practices.","Rural land use and Nature conservation and land use and Sustainable land use and Multilevel cooperation and Social economic and environmental & nbsp and sustainability and GOVERNANCE and Norway","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103066","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103066",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

For them, the carnivore controversies are part of a conflict between dominant and subordinate cultural forms and bodies of knowledge. Representing dominant culture and hegemonic knowledge, managers and scientists have a hard time establishing rapport with anticarnivore hardliners. It is suggested that joint practical work may diminish some cultural barriers, and a project where this has been crucial is described.

Indigenous relations to nature are, however, based on unity between use and protection, implying that human use is necessary for effective protection. Often protected areas include the homelands of Indigenous peoples, whose needs and rights are still being ignored to a large extent. This paper explores the effects of a plan for a significant increase of large nature protection areas in Norway, still under implementation. Most of the new protection areas are in the heartland of the Indigenous Sami, whose core livelihood is reindeer management. The plan implies transfer of jurisdiction from Indigenous and local domains to formalised central domains. In several cases, this has provoked Indigenous and rural groups to organised resistance. In this case study, there are signs of new tensions between Sami and other rural groups. Indigenous land use can be marginalised by park restrictions and increasing pressure from visitor activity. The Sami response was to boycott the park management board leading to a stalemate. A robust solution seems to require consideration of deeper institutional levels.","national parks and Indigenous peoples and conservation and Sami reindeer management and institutional level analysis and LAND RIGHTS and POLICY and PEOPLE and Norway and Poverty","10.1111/j.1745-5871.2007.00449.x     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-5871.2007.00449.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The results show that the two strongest determinants that explain actors' initial support of the governance change as a means to alleviate conflict are (i) the relationship of actors to the protected areas in terms of knowledge of the protected areas and mental models on conservation and (ii) the economic relevance of the areas for them. Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sami), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives.

Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found.

The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesteralen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesteralen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.","AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES and GEESE BRANTA-LEUCOPSIS and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BARNACLE GEESE and SNOW GEESE and LAND-USE and HABITAT USE and CONSEQUENCES and CONSERVATION and Norway","10.1371/journal.pone.0071912     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071912",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Agricultural","Observational studies"

In this context, the ecosystem services (ES) framework has been widely adopted for identifying and assessing the values at stake, yet the concept ignores benefits from water and land use functions as important contributions for societal welfare. This paper aims to contribute knowledge for improved benefit assessments in human-modified landscapes, exemplified by watersheds regulated for the production of hydropower. Through a case study approach in two regulated watersheds in Norway, beneficiaries' perceptions of the benefits associated with key watershed activities, i.e., hydropower production, kayaking, angling, and hiking, are presented. Considering the beneficiaries' perspectives, we discuss the relative ability of economic, quantitative, and qualitative assessment methods to present benefits. The study shows that benefit assessments must be carried out on different scales of governance, as benefits are context and scale dependent. We argue for an approach which considers a balance of benefits obtained from ecosystem services, and from water and land use functions within ecological limits. The suitability of the ES framework for guiding benefit assessments in a human-modified landscape and its complementarity with the sustainability concept for informing local-level decision-making are discussed.","ecosystem services and benefit assessments and beneficiaries and regulated watercourses and sustainability dimensions and hydropower and VALUES and VALUATION and SCALE and Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.3390/su11061821     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061821",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Norway is currently making a significant move to establish a new management model based on national reindeer regions and regional management plans. A focus on wild reindeer as a flagship species allows the species to be included as a broad conservation objective in complex land-use plans. The authors surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Rondane and Setesdal regions to examine their perceptions of the current status of reindeer and how management relates to other social and development issues. Local actors and institutions, including hunters, were perceived as more responsible and suited to make decisions about reindeer population sizes and management objectives than non-local actors.

Reindeer nomadic husbandry is a coupled social-ecological system that sustains resilience by interacting with the animals and environment: either the herders adjust their actions to animal behavior or change this behavior in ways that suit the herd and pastures. Stressors and shocks affecting Sámi reindeer husbandry are, for instance, sudden warm air temperatures with subsequent snow melting and freezing in winter, bad grazing conditions, loss of grazing lands, and even socio-economic reforms. All these are sudden, unprepared, or forced changes. Climate change resilience includes using reindeer herders’ Indigenous knowledge of selective breeding by maintaining different phenotypes of reindeer such as non-productive and castrated animals in the herd. Nevertheless, in Sámi reindeer husbandry in Norway today, low numbers of male reindeer and the absence of castrated animals challenge the herders’ resilience coping strategies. This chapter discusses factors that constrain resilience in herding societies, contribute to the transformation of reindeer husbandry and the erosion of resilience in the herding society. © The Author(s) 2024.","Reindeer husbandry and Social-ecological resilience and Tipping points in reindeer husbandry and Thinking","10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

In Mid-Norway, farmers scare spring-staging pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus off their land to protect crops, and this has had clear effects on goose distribution. To protect the geese, Norwegian authorities have implemented economic compensation to farmers to discourage scaring, but this has not been prioritised to accommodate the biological requirements and dispersal patterns of the geese, though such an approach is clearly needed. To address this need, we assessed the negative effects of scaring geese during 2004-2007, and built a species distribution model to identify sites suitable for goose foraging. We subsequently combined known foraging sites with sites identified by our model and prioritised these sites according to their connectivity, perimeter area ratio, years of historic use and proximity to roost. By combining historic data on foraging sites, a species distribution model, and a simple, accountable site selection process we demonstrate how the current compensation scheme can be made 10 times more efficient through strategic prioritisation. Our approach has direct implications for alleviating similar goose-agriculture conflicts throughout Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

Because the land area available for tree planting may serve multiple purposes, striking the right balance between climate goals and other objectives is crucial. We conducted a survey of the Norwegian population to investigate potential land-use conflicts that may arise from executing a large-scale afforestation programme. Respondents were presented with three land-use alternatives to replace formerly grazed agricultural land. We used manipulated landscape photos to elicit their underlying value orientations. We combined multiple correspondence analysis with latent class regression models to reveal preference heterogeneity. Our models grouped respondents into three latent classes, with 24%, 24% and 52%, respectively, expressing a preference for forest carbon sequestration, recreation or agriculture as the most crucial land-use function to be retained. Birth year emerged as a strong predictor of class membership. Specifically, generations born before 1970 were more inclined to support the continuation of agricultural landscapes, while those born in 1980 and later showed a stronger inclination towards natural forest succession for carbon sequestration or recreational purposes. Quantitatively, every 10-year reduction in age increased the odds of a respondent belonging to the forestation or recreation class (relative to the agricultural class) by a factor of 2. Interestingly, even among respondents who were classified as most climate concerned, natural forests were 50% more likely to be preferred over monoculture spruce plantation as a policy option. This suggests that there may be public resistance to spruce planting for climate mitigation purposes in Norway. © 2023, The Author(s).","Carbon sequestration and Finite-mixture model and Land-use preferences and Latent class regression and Multiple correspondence analysis and Public perception and Norway and Carbon and Climate change and Reforestation and Regression analysis and Agricultural landscapes and Finite mixture modeling and Forest carbon sequestration and Land-use preference and Latent class and Natural forests and afforestation and age structure and carbon sequestration and climate change and correspondence analysis and forest cover and mitigation and monoculture and plantation and reforestation and succession and tree planting and Land use and Trees","10.1007/s10584-023-03588-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03588-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference - between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this. 2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty. 3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density. 4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, -including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programmes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.",NA,"10.1111/1365-2664.12992","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12992",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational and simulations"

The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked}the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon cycle and Climate change and Ecosystem effects and Feedback and Flood events and Norway and carbon cycle and carbon sequestration and climate change and ecosystem service and environmental effect and flood and global climate and landscape ecology and sustainability and Buffers","10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0059.1","https://doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0059.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Opinions"

A conflict over restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised comprehensive local debate.

Due to continuous decline in eider populations in the island of Tautra off the Norwegian west coast from the late 1970s and onwards a number of conservation measures were implemented here to halt this development and the results are yet to be seen. This paper presents the conservation of declining eider populations in Tautra as a case study of conservation challenges in agricultural landscapes, and illustrates the complex interconnections of human use of biological resources and habitat shaping within the context of a subsistence agroecosystem. It contributes new data and perspectives on the challenge to conserve dimensions of biological diversity that have been shaped and developed within previous and lost agroecosystems and economic contexts. The current paper shows the hazard of focussing conservation measures on only one dimension of biodiversity without incorporating other dimensions like the human management of other habitats which had important functions for the development of habitats for the target biodiversity component in the pre-industrial agroecosystem. Successful biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes demands involvement of the historical aspect of resource use to understand the ecological dynamics of habitats and populations. Further, since the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of one habitat are interrelated to other habitats, it is necessary to include the landscape mosaic with different habitats in the conservation efforts and programmes.

The preferences of the local public are increasingly assessed and involved in the planning of mitigation measures for impacted rivers. Aesthetic assessment methods using a common user per-spective, i.e., an “on‐the‐ground” perspective, could potentially be improved by using an aerial perspective facilitated by modern drone technology. Studies on the compatibility of these two perspectives of assessment in terms of public preference elicitation are lacking so far. In river Nea, Norway, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the visual preferences of the local public for different environmental mitigation measures related to weirs, minimum flow, and recreational infrastructure using both perspectives. The results indicate that there exist significant differences in the preferences for scenarios based on the two different visual perspectives, and that a compatibility between them cannot be assumed and therefore requires further investigation.

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

In both cases I quantified timber production as a measure of land acquisition cost and use the ratio between the species richness and timber production as a measure of conservation cost-efficiency. I found a positive correlation between timber production and local species richness of birds as well as beetles, indicating that the forests most valuable for forestry are also the ones most valuable for biodiversity conservation. I used different selection procedures for combining sites in a reverse network to find the minimum set of sites that included all vulnerable species. The minimum set of sites for birds was 30% spruce forest, 30% pine forest, and 40% broad-leaved forest (the three main forest types). The minimum set of sites for the beetles was uniformly distributed along the altitudinal gradient. Both minimum sets were mot cost-efficient for species conservation. I suggest that equal coverage of different productivity classes is more efficient for optimizing biodiversity conservation than over-representing low productivity sites. Less than 1% of Norwegian boreal forests have been protected as nature reserves. The reserve network is fairly representative with respect to altitude, but it is seriously skewed toward low productivity sites. The current network is suboptimal with respect to forest type representativeness, species protection, and cost-efficiency. This is a result of an inefficient strategy of selecting reserve sites and an unfortunate combination of selection criteria.

Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas.

Karst.) stand in order to evaluate the effect of thinning regime on C sequestration. At 22 years old, the stand was reduced from 3190 to 2070, 1100 and 820 trees per hectare in four replicates. The N2070 treatment represents the recommended start density in practical forestry, while the other represent a moderate to large reduction in tree number at the present stand age. Aboveground biomass was estimated from single tree measurements of diameter and height based on allometric functions. Litter fall was collected during one and a half years and soil respiration was measured on five occasions during one summer. Ground vegetation was mapped and sampled for biomass, C and N determination. A significant decrease in aboveground tree (including stump-root system) C storage of 27% and 22% due to thinning was found in the N820 and N1100 treatments, respectively, compared to the N2070 treatment. Ground vegetation C storage was little affected by treatment, while litter fall C showed a non-significant decrease in the N820 and N1100 treatments compared to the N2070 treatment. Soil respiration was significantly lower in parts of the summer in the N2070 treatment compared to the N820 treatment. The reason for this is still unexplained since no differences in soil temperature, soil moisture or litter fall chemistry was found between the treatments. No significant treatment effects on humus and mineral soil C storage could be detected. With the present soil variability, the time period of 32 years is probably too short to detect soil C differences due to thinning. The N storage followed the same pattern as for C.

The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.","Alces alces and bioeconomics and Canis lupus and harvesting and migration and moose and sustainable development and wolf and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and SEASONAL MIGRATION and FOREST DAMAGE and BODY-MASS and MORTALITY and PATTERNS and AGE and DYNAMICS and DENSITY and SENESCENCE","10.2981/06-084     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/06-084",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

The authors mapped the vegetation on Froan and used rule-based GIS-modelling to predict the relative potential for future vegetation changes. The model was based on a range of map layers, including management themes such as history of heath burning and peat removal, current practices of sheep grazing, and also themes derived from the vegetation map, such as soil nutrients, soil moisture and present management status. The resulting model output provides relative probabilities of future changes under different land-use scenarios, and highlights where management efforts should be focused in order to maintain the traditional landscape character.","coastal heath and cultural landscape and rule-based GIS-modelling and management and vegetation mapping and CLIMATE-CHANGE and CALLUNA-VULGARIS and LAND-USE and DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS and NITROGEN DEPOSITION and STATISTICAL-MODEL and VEGETATION and DYNAMICS and LANDSCAPE and HEATHLAND and Norway","10.1080/00291951.2010.528224     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/00291951.2010.528224",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Naturally open area under the tree-line","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a nonmonetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Smola windpower plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-year metric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smola ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site.

We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

Policy reform, market trends and changes to the way citizens and consumers think about the countryside all suggest a need for thinking strategically about the future development of these areas. However, without a broad involvement of stakeholders, land use conflicts, and social and cultural conflicts in general, may increase. Involving stakeholders in upland areas can be facilitated by using scenario technique and by discussing alternative futures in local stakeholder panels. In this paper we present four scenarios of land-use change for the year 2030, and their assessments by stakeholder panels in Scotland, France, Norway, Switzerland, Slovakia and Greece. The aim of the paper is to explore the ways in which stakeholders in these locations advocate and assess these scenarios. We also explore how stakeholders in different countries weight the visual landscape impacts, the livelihood and biodiversity aspects of the scenarios in their assessment, and the reasons for their prioritising. The cross-country analysis shows that stakeholders across the study areas are united in their overall rejection of agricultural liberalisation, advocating a production-oriented, but multifunctional and environmentally-friendly agriculture that maintains landscapes and biodiversity.

In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Flows of supplied ecosystem services depend on a broad range of factors, including climate, hydrology, land management and human population density. The aims of this study were: 1) to quantify the total economic value (TEV) of consumed ecosystem services across Nordic catchments, 2) to explain variation in ecosystem service value using socio-geographic and natural factors as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression, and 3) to determine which societal groups benefit from these ecosystem services. Furthermore, we tested the scientific rigour of our framework based on the concept of final ecosystem services (FES). We used a spatially explicit, integrative framework for ecosystem services quantification to compile data on final ecosystem services provision from six catchments across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Our estimates showed a broad variation in TEV and in the proportion contributed by separate services, with the highest TEV of €7,199 ± 4,561 ha-1 y-1 (mean ± standard deviation) in the Norwegian Orrevassdraget catchment, and the lowest TEV of €183 ± 517 ha-1 y-1 in the Finnish Simojoki catchment. The value of material services was dependent on both geographic factors and land management practices, while the value of immaterial services was strongly dependent on population density and the availability of water. Using spatial data on land use, forest productivity and population density in a GIS analysis showed where hotspots of ecosystem services supply are located, and where specific stakeholder groups benefit most. We show that our framework is applicable to a broad variety of data sources and across countries, making international comparative analyses possible. © 2021 Immerzeel et al.

One of the aims was to reduce conflicts between geese and agriculture to an acceptable level. Since 2006, Norway has offered subsidies to farmers that provide refuge areas for geese on their land. We evaluate the mid-Norwegian goose management subsidy scheme, with a view to its adjustment to prevailing ecological and socio-economic parameters. The analysis indicates that the legitimacy of the scheme is highly dependent on transparency of knowledge management and accountability of management scheme to the farming community. Among farmers, as well as front-line officials, outcomes of prioritisation processes within the scheme are judged unfair when there is an evident mismatch between payments and genuine damage. We suggest how the scheme can be made more fair and responsive to ecological changes, within a framework of adaptive management.","Agriculture and Pink-footed goose and Refuge areas and Wildlife management and GEESE and COMPENSATION and LANDSCAPES and MIGRATION and DAMAGE","10.1007/s13280-016-0884-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-016-0884-4",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Increasing concern over the environmental impact of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes. These schemes compensate farmers financially for any loss of income associated with measures that aim to benefit the environment or biodiversity. There are currently agri-environment schemes in 26 out of 44 European countries. 2. Agri-environment schemes vary markedly between countries even within the European Union. The main objectives include reducing nutrient and pesticide emissions, protecting biodiversity, restoring landscapes and preventing rural depopulation. In virtually all countries the uptake of schemes is highest in areas of extensive agriculture where biodiversity is still relatively high and lowest in intensively farmed areas where biodiversity is low. 3. Approximately $ 24·3 billion has been spent on agri-environment schemes in the European Union (EU) since 1994, an unknown proportion of it on schemes with biodiversity conservation aims. We carried out a comprehensive search for studies that test the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in published papers or reports. Only 62 evaluation studies were found originating from just five EU countries and Switzerland (5). Indeed 76% of the studies were from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where until now only c . 6% of the EU agri-environmental budget has been spent. Other studies were from Germany (6), Ireland (3) and Portugal (1). 4. In the majority of studies, the research design was inadequate to assess reliably the effectiveness of the schemes. Thirty-one percent did not contain a statistical analysis. Where an experimental approach was used, designs were usually weak and biased towards giving a favourable result. The commonest experimental design (37% of the studies) was a comparison of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes and control areas. However, there is a risk of bias if either farmers or scheme co-ordinators select the sites for agri-environment schemes. In such cases the sites are likely to have a higher biodiversity at the outset compared to the controls. This problem may be addressed by collecting baseline data (34% of studies), comparing trends (32%) or changes (26%) in biodiversity between areas with and without schemes or by pairing scheme and control sites that experience similar environmental conditions (16%). 5. Overall, 54% of the examined species (groups) demonstrated increases and 6% decreases in species richness or abundance compared with controls. Seventeen percent showed increases for some species and decreases for other species, while 23% showed no change at all in response to agri-environment schemes. The response varied between taxa. Of 19 studies examining the response of birds that included a statistical analysis, four showed significant increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and nine showed both increases and decreases. Comparative figures for 20 arthropod studies yielded 11 studies that showed an increase in species richness or abundance, no study showed a decrease and three showed both increases and",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00868.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00868.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems",NA

Complete, full-coverage vegetation surveys are often used for this purpose, but these are expensive undertakings. We have presented a method to downscale information from regional sampling surveys by poststratification using a land cover map derived from satellite-based measures of reflectance values. This approach opens new prospects for landscape-level evaluation of productivity. We applied this method to eight grazing districts (19-245 km(2)) in Setesdal Vesthei, Norway, in 2006. Sheep densities in three of eight grazing districts of Setesdal Vesthei fluctuated above the estimated grazing capacity. We fitted 43 sheep with Global Positioning System collars in two contrasting grazing districts in 2007-2008 to assess their selection of the land cover productivity classes in the map used for poststratification. In the area with high vegetation coverage, sheep selection increased in areas with an overall higher productivity, supporting the main basis of the approach. However, in the grazing districts with lower vegetation coverage, selection was higher for areas of overall low vegetation productivity. The likely explanation is the presence of small areas of snow bed vegetation with high-quality forage in areas with a generally rocky surface. Our study provides a first step toward a grazing capacity evaluation to achieve a sustainable management of sheep on alpine ranges of Scandinavia, and our approach is likely applicable to other open alpine ranges in the northern hemisphere.","Global Positioning System and habitat selection and land cover and poststratification and resource selection functions and rangeland management and SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION and LAND-COVER and LARGE HERBIVORE and HABITAT SELECTION and ANIMAL HUSBANDRY and HILL VEGETATION and DENSITY and LIVESTOCK and MODEL and THRESHOLDS and Sheep","10.2111/REM-D-12-00177.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-12-00177.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Concerns over anthropogenic and natural drivers have led to change in the management regime from a population-based model to an area-based model. More complex management goals, increasing involvement of stakeholders, and larger management units call for improved knowledge about reindeer-related values. We examined the responses of 1000 respondents to 39 statements of attitudes and values associated with wild reindeer presence and the management situation in two reindeer regions of southern Norway. We used a partial least-squares path modeling approach to examine the nexus between the attraction of wild reindeer, sustainability concerns, utilitarian and non-utilitarian values, conflicts, and attitudes toward hunting. The results show that local concepts of the sustainability of reindeer are based on opinions about the ecological requirements as well as the roles reindeer can play in the social and economic development of the communities. The attraction of reindeer is a function of consumptive as well as non-consumptive objectives. Segments of the community with different consumptive orientations can share ideas about the attraction of reindeer, but diverge in their interpretation of the sustainability of the species. Improved knowledge about the diversity and complexity of value orientations associated with wild reindeer can be a useful tool for developing multi-objective management frameworks with a diversity of stakeholders who may share similar values and interests, although they have different experience and knowledge bases.","wild reindeer and Norway and management and values and community development and ENVIRONMENTAL PARADIGM SCALE and NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT and VALUE ORIENTATIONS and INFRASTRUCTURE and FORESTRY and CARIBOU and MODELS and Social Values","10.14430/arctic4647     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic4647",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Yet little is known about whether these landowners would be interested in increasing carbon sequestration on their land and selling carbon credits. Only a handful of studies have examined the factors that motivate family forest owners to participate in carbon offset programs, and all of these studies have been conducted in the United States. This study addresses this information gap using data from a mail survey of 1500 Norwegian family forest owners. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the effect of various carbon program, forestland, and landowner characteristics on participation in a hypothetical carbon offset program. Results suggest that there is a considerable amount of interest among Norwegian family forest owners and that the most important predictors of participation are payment amount offered, perceived barriers posed by management actions, importance placed on non-market forest amenities, and attitudes towards climate change.

In this study we present a situation where local goose hunting arrangements respond to objectives in an international management plan for pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) and a local wish to reduce goose numbers as means to reduce grazing damage on farmland. A unique ten-year dataset provides an evaluation of the efficiency of voluntary actions at a local scale for implementing a policy of population control of geese, and general lessons are drawn for collaboration and co-production of knowledge for adaptive management. The study demonstrates how both the hunters and geese adapt in a situation where increasing the harvest of geese is the main objective. Introducing hunting-free days and safe foraging areas significantly increased goose numbers in the study area, with a corresponding increase in hunting success in terms of number of harvested geese. The geese's behavioural response to hunting also triggered the hunters to adapt accordingly by optimal timing and placement in the landscape. Based on the results of the present study we suggest a framework for local implementation of management actions. Bringing end-users on board, facilitates processes and strengthens the achievements, as they represent the actors where implementation occurs. Specifically, our findings demonstrate how optimal goose hunting can be practiced by the use of an adaptive framework with active stakeholder participation.",NA,"10.1007/s13280-021-01590-2","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01590-2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Quasi-observational studies"

However, it is uninformative on the prevalence of perspectives in the general population. The Norwegian government considers planting spruce climate forests on abandoned pastures, the habitat for many red listed species. We identify three prevailing stakeholder perspectives in the climate forest debate using the Q method; one pro climate forest and two against with differing motivations. Using the so-called scale creation method (Danielson, 2009) and a national survey, we measure the support of the general population for these perspectives and elicit their concern for ecosystem services. About half of the sample is pro climate forest. Opposition is greater in regions where spruce is uncommon and abandoned pastures are common. The impact of climate forests on biodiversity and landscapes is a concern. Conflicts would be dampened if climate forest policy took impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity better into account. Our proposed generalised Q method combines two strengths: the depth of the Q method with the breadth of the general population survey. The method demonstrates a way forward in ecological economics to better capture representative values and perspectives in ecosystem service management and help design climate and environmental policies with greater acceptance. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change and Conservation and Ecosystem services and Forest and Q Method and Values and Norway and Picea and biodiversity and climate change and conservation status and ecological economics and ecosystem management and ecosystem service and esthetics and forest ecosystem and forestry policy and landscape ecology and numerical method and resource use","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106588","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106588",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

This paper describes the scientific foundation for management according to conservation limits and management targets for Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon, a highly valued and heavily exploited anadromous fish species. Based on stock recruitment relationships during the freshwater phase, the biomass of females necessary to attain the carrying capacity (yielding average maximum recruitment) has been established as conservation limits for each of the 439 Norwegian populations. Using a simulation model based on reported catch and estimates of exploitation rates, the probability and percentage attainment of the conservation limits have been assessed annually since 2008, and exploitation advice provided for 176 of the largest populations. The number of populations that attained their conservation limits increased substantially after the new management scheme was introduced, despite that the number of returning salmon remained at historical low levels. Overall the populations evaluated in 2011 were at 95% of their conservation limits compared to 91% in 2008 and 85% in 2005. The improvement could largely be attributed to reduced exploitation rates, due to new restrictions in both the marine and river fisheries. The new management scheme also improved the catch statistics and stimulated data acquisition for management.

Having major implications for the abilities of actors to pursue their interests in practical forest management, the methodologies of biodiversity mapping have been highly controversial and contested. We identify two different forest ontologies, or realities, that were enacted by the two main competing methodologies for such mapping. The methodologies, SiS and EiF, were supported by what we term the environmental and the forestry segments, respectively. Whereas a mapping approach associated with the environmental segment enacted a varied and complex forest ontology, a mapping approach related to the forestry segment enacted a comprehensible and more standardized forest ontology. In analyzing the two ontologies, we explore the links between the configuration of the mapping methodologies and 1) the forest realities they enact, 2) the scientific ideals they advocate, and 3) the relationship between mapping and management decisions. In particular, we argue that the ontologies have different political implications, generally favoring the actors that support them. On a more general level, we show that ontological politics is performed in the enactment of different ontologies related to different political segments, associated with different sectors. © 2022","Biodiversity mapping and Forest governance and Ontological politics and Norway and biodiversity and forest management and governance approach and habitat loss and mapping and politics and article and forest and forestry and ontology and Trees","10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.015","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.015",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

However, not all land use is equal, and many traditional land uses, and emergent cultural landscapes support important biodiversity and provide multiple benefits to society. Despite their importance, cultural landscapes are threatened by several factors, the most prominent being abandonment of the traditional practices that maintain them. Afforestation schemes to mitigate atmospheric carbon are an additional emerging threat. Abandonment and afforestation threaten both ecological processes and socio-cultural values, but surprisingly, there is little knowledge on the concurrent social and ecological impacts. We used a multi-method approach of ecological field surveys to quantify the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services (ES) in four different vegetation types representing managed open vegetation, natural forest types for abandonment and planted forests to represent afforestation. We explored the match and/or mismatch between socio-cultural values and biophysical supply of ES in those vegetation types and investigated the socio-demographic factors that influence socio-cultural values for ES. Biophysical supply of ES was variable across vegetation types and synergies were as common as trade-offs. Socio-cultural values were high for most ES in open vegetation and natural forests and low for planted forests. Biophysical supply and socio-cultural values were well matched across the vegetation types for biodiversity and agricultural products, but strongly mismatched for climate regulation. We show that although trade-offs occur both within value- and between value domains, synergies are also common. Our results show that abandonment would impact on the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of some ES but that this impact would be lower than that of afforestation. We argue that our approach can be used to manage trade-offs and enhance synergies between value domains for a holistic approach to landscape stewardship that supports both people and nature.",NA,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106967","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106967",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, semi-natural heathlands","Quasi-observational studies"

For this purpose, we turn to environmental psychology and use place attachment, the functional and emotional bond people have to a defined place. We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model.

"455","rayyan-674262683","Agricultural policies in Norway and effects on soil erosion","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY","Norwegian agriculture depends heavily on governmental subsidies, due to small farming units and high costs. Due to a limited home market, many agricultural productions are also quantum regulated. Milk and grain production was regulated starting in the 1950 using region specific prices. At the level of three counties in south-eastern Norway, this policy resulted in an increase in the grain producing area from 30 to 80% of total agricultural area causing a similar reduction in grassland area over a 30 year period. The change in land use caused by this policy more than doubled the estimated soil losses by water erosion. During the late seventies extensive land levelling in the same region stimulated by subsidies lead to an estimated two-three fold increase in soil erosion. The increase was especially high when former ravine landscapes used for pasture were levelled and turned into arable land that was ploughed in autumn. Very visible erosion and increasing negative offsite effects on water quality together with overproduction put an end to the subsidies for land levelling. Erosion research was started around 1980 and the results from this research lead to the introduction of several kinds of payments in the early 1990 to encourage more sustainable agricultural production. Since the policy changed there has been changes in cultivating systems and a reduction in soil erosion has been estimated. Thus, farmers' behaviour and soil erosion in Norway is strongly influenced by agricultural and environmental policy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"456","rayyan-674258227","The role of ecological and economic factors in the management of a spatially structured moose Alces alces population","WILDLIFE BIOLOGY","We present a bioeconomic model for moose Alces alces management in Norway, where two sub-populations of moose are subject to different site-specific mortality rates caused by the spatial distribution of territorial wolf Canis lupus packs, and are coupled by the seasonal migration of moose. The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.","Alces alces and bioeconomics and Canis lupus and harvesting and migration and moose and sustainable development and wolf and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and SEASONAL MIGRATION and FOREST DAMAGE and BODY-MASS and MORTALITY and PATTERNS and AGE and DYNAMICS and DENSITY and SENESCENCE","10.2981/06-084     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/06-084",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Karst) on lands in various states of natural transition to a forest dominated by deciduous broadleaved tree species. Given the aspiration to bring emissions on balance with removals in the latter half of the 21st century in effort to limit the global mean temperature rise to ""well below"" 2°C, the effectiveness of such a policy is unclear given relatively low spruce growth rates in the region. Further convoluting the picture is the magnitude and relevance of surface albedo changes linked to such projects, which typically counteract the benefits of an enhanced forest CO2 sink in high-latitude regions. Here, we carry out a rigorous empirically based assessment of the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) potential of large-scale spruce planting in Norway, taking into account transient developments in both terrestrial carbon sinks and surface albedo over the 21st century and beyond. We find that surface albedo changes would likely play a negligible role in counteracting tCDR, yet given low forest growth rates in the region, notable tCDR benefits from such projects would not be realized until the second half of the 21st century, with maximum benefits occurring even later around 2150. We estimate Norway's total accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 and 2150 (including surface albedo changes) to be 447 (±240) and 852 (±295) Mt CO2 -eq. at mean net present values of US$ 12 (±3) and US$ 13 (±2) per ton CDR, respectively. For perspective, the accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 represents around 8 years of Norway's total current annual production-based (i.e., territorial) CO2 -eq. emissions.","Norway and Trees and Carbon Dioxide","10.1111/gcb.15228","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15228",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

We delineate hotspots and coldspots of two biodiversity conservation features and five regulating and cultural services by incorporating an indicator of 'threat', i.e. timber harvest profitability for forest areas in Telemark (Norway). We found hotspots, where high values of biodiversity, ecosystem services and threat coincide, ranging from 0.1 to 7.1% of the area, depending on varying threshold levels. Targeting of these areas for conservation follows reactive conservation approaches. In coldspots, high biodiversity and ecosystem service values coincide with low levels of threat, and cover 0.1-3.4% of the forest area. These areas might serve proactive conservation approaches at lower opportunity cost (foregone timber harvest profits). We conclude that a combination of indicators of biodiversity, ecosystem services and potential threat is an appropriate approach for spatial prioritization of proactive and reactive conservation strategies.","Carbon sequestration and Carbon storage and Conservation management and Existence value and Recreation and Spatial priority setting and FOREST MANAGEMENT and CARBON and FRAMEWORK and SYNERGIES and FINLAND and NORWAY","10.1007/s13280-017-0922-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0922-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

A study, based on the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), was performed during the fall of 1990. Data were collected through in-person interviews of 1204 persons above 15 years of age. The main objectives of the study were to analyze: 1) Attitudes toward the present state of Norwegian forests, 2) Attitudes toward and maximum willingness to pay for changes in current forest management, 3) Preferences and maximum willingness to pay for preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests, and 4) Attitudes toward society's right to impose restrictions on forest management on private forest land. Based on responses to statements related to the forest area people usually visit, the study showed a low degree of conflict regarding the present state of Norwegian forests. A ranking of possible results of two alternative forest management strategies, i.e. 1) a more cautious forest management or 2) preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests, gave the highest average scores to ''Preservation of endangered plants and animals'' and ''Preservation of ''virgin'' forests for our descendants'', both related to the second management strategy. The maximum willingness to pay for a more cautious forest management was 277 Norwegian kroner (NOK) per household and year, with a median value of NOK 50. 47% of the sample preferred the preservation alternative A specified by the governmental committee, Barskogutvalget, while 18% preferred alternative B and 9% preferred alternative C, corresponding to the governmental decision. 15% preferred a 0-alternative, i.e. no further preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests.

Our objective was therefore to explore the long-term effects of organic and conventional cropping systems on soil bacterial and fungal quantity, their community structures and their combined function. To do so, we sampled soil from a long-term experiment in Southeast Norway in 2014, 25 years after the experiment was established, and performed a range of microbial analyses on the samples. The experiment consists of six cropping systems with differences in crop rotations, soil tillage, and with nutrient application regimes covering inorganic fertilizers, cattle slurry (both separately and combined with inorganic fertilizers) and biogas residues from digested household biowaste. The quantity of soil microbes was assessed by extraction of microbial C and N and by analysis of soil DNA (bacterial 16S rRNA, and fungal rRNA internal transcribed spacer region). The structures of the microbial communities were determined and assessment of relatedness of bacterial and fungal communities was done by the unweighted pair group method. Estimates of richness and diversity were based on numbers of unique operational taxonomic units from DNA sequencing and the function of the microbial assembly was measured by means of enzyme assays. Our results showed that production systems including leys had higher microbial biomass and higher numbers of bacterial and fungal gene copies than did systems with cash crops only. A cropping system which appeared to be particularly unfavourable was a reference-system where stubble, roots and exudates were the single source of organic material. Production system significantly affected both bacterial and fungal community structures in the soil. Systems including leys and organic fertilization had higher enzyme activities than did systems with cash crops only. An inclusion of ley in the rotation did not, however, increase either microbial richness or microbial diversity. In fact, the otherwise suboptimal reference-system appeared to have a richness and diversity of both bacteria and fungi at levels similar to those of the other cropping systems, indicating that the microbial function is largely maintained under less favourable agricultural treatments because of the general resilience of soil microorganisms to various stresses. Neither disturbance through tillage nor the use of chemical fertilizer or chemical plant protection measures seemed as such to influence soil microbial communities. Thus, no differences between conventional and organic farming practices as such were found. We conclude that the choice of agricultural management determines the actual microbial community structure, but that biodiversity in general is almost unaffected by cropping system over many years. Adequate addition of organic material is essential to ensure a properly functioning microbial ensemble and, thus, to secure soil structure and fertility over time.","Cropping system and Microbial structure and Microbial function and Gene sequencing and Enzyme assay and ORGANIC-MATTER and BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES and CROPPING SYSTEMS and BIOMASS-C and LAND-USE and TILLAGE and MANAGEMENT and DIVERSITY and NITROGEN and QUALITY","10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.103387     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.103387",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

This paper intends to contribute to clarifying domestic influences of global initiatives, by an exploratory contrasting of two alternative analytical perspectives. For the first perspective, regime effects, two cases of policy changes in Norway revealed variation in effects depending on the scope of analysis and reference points used for measurement. Compared to a situation with no regime, an effect is revealed for the climate regime, while for biodiversity, the effect is uncertain. For problem-solving achievements, both cases of policy change indicate difficulties in determining effects, due to ambiguity in regime objectives. The initial contrasting of regime effects with global governance influences, the second perspective, find that these are incompatible concepts, with the governance influences encompassing broader sources of influences and their dynamic interactions. The explorations point to the need for clarity in what is the topic under study (effect of one or more regimes, or governance influences) and to the analytical delimitations (regime obligations, process-generated effects of regime, broader regime consequences, or governance influences). Finally, promising topics for extending our understanding of national-global interactions are identified.","forest governance and conflicting objectives and biodiversity and forest protection and climate mitigation and INCLUDING LAND-USE and Trees","10.1080/02827581.2014.1000478     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2014.1000478",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

This win win objective has been difficult to accomplish; cross-compliance has, therefore, been suggested as a mechanism to ensure sustainability. Cross-compliance, which requires producers to conform to production regulations and environmental standards to qualify for direct payments, has been a popular instrument in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Since 1990, cross-compliance has been the main characteristic of policy design in Sami reindeer husbandry in Finnmark, Norway. All direct transfers to the Sami pastoralists have been connected to harvesting demands to decrease the number of reindeer and to conserve pastures. The content of these incentive-based mechanisms are decided through negotiated agreements with the Sami Reindeer Herders' Association of Norway (NRL), and the regulation of reindeer numbers and access to pastures are delegated to co-management boards. Despite the participation of the Sami pastoralists in shaping these policies, win win objectives have not been achieved. Although the cross-compliance program could have been improved by payment for graded results, the lack of regulations by the administration or co-management boards is more likely to be the cause of failure to reach sustainability. Despite the long-term failures of the cross-compliance program, policies have been slow to change. We might attribute this delay to the NRL's strong position in the negotiated agreements. In general, we argue that the success of the cross-compliance program depends on a well-functioning governance system that can implement regulations and sanctions if incentives do not work as intended.

This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2%) and the non-use zone (+3.2%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79%.","Ecosystem and Trees","10.1371/journal.pone.0112557","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112557",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pinkfooted geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trondelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.","PINK-FOOTED GEESE and GOOSE ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BRANTA-LEUCOPSIS and CONSERVATION and DISTURBANCE and DISTRIBUTIONS and MANAGEMENT and STOPOVER and BRITAIN and MODELS","10.2981/wlb.00192     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00192",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Hence, there is a need to spatially identify important sites for conservation planning. The term 'ecosystem service hotspot' has often been used for this purpose, but definitions of this term are ambiguous. Objectives We review and classify methods to spatially delineate hotspots. We test how spatial configuration of hotspots for a set of ecosystem services differs depending on the applied method. We compare the outcomes to a heuristic site prioritisation approach (Marxan). Methods The four tested hotspot methods are top richest cells, spatial clustering, intensity, and richness. In a conservation scenario we set a target of conserving 10 % of the quantity of five regulating and cultural services for the forest area of Telemark county, Norway. Results Spatial configuration of selected areas as retrieved by the four hotspots and Marxan differed considerably. Pairwise comparisons were at the lower end of the scale of the Kappa statistic (0.11-0.27). The outcomes also differed considerably in mean target achievement, cost-effectiveness in terms of land-area needed per unit target achievement and compactness in terms of edge-to-area ratio. Conclusions An ecosystem service hotspot can refer to either areas containing high values of one service or areas with multiple services. Differences in spatial configuration among hotspot methods can lead to uncertainties for decision-making. This also has consequences for analysing the spatial co-occurrence of hotspots of multiple services and of services and biodiversity.","Hot spot and Mapping and Modelling and Overlap and BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS and MANAGEMENT and FRAMEWORK and MULTIFUNCTIONALITY and SYNERGIES and SCIENCE and BUNDLES and DEMAND and CARBON","10.1007/s10980-015-0258-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0258-5",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Some of these changes are localized and pertain to changing weather and grazing conditions caused by climate change and land fragmentation. Others, driven by national management policies and governance specifically related to predators, are poorly adjusted for the different and localized contexts. The pastoralists are inherently adaptive and have a long history of responding well to variable changing conditions. This is now changing with the continued increasing pressures from many directions. The central government systematically ignores pastoralists’ traditional knowledge and enforces narrow sector policies to be implemented at regional and local levels. We address the effect of how institutional, physical, and societal constraints challenge pastoralists’ prospects for sustainable adaptation. Our results show how pastoralists’ livelihoods become compromised and potentially threatened because they are forced to respond in ways that they know are counterproductive in the long run. Adaptation outcomes are affected by different approaches and epistemologies that are situated across scale and context in terms of regional and national regulations versus local empirical reality among the pastoral communities. This study concludes that radical change is needed toward a more holistic governance in which multiple knowledge systems are integrated to ensure sustainable adaptation at all levels.

The latter includes the expansion of private, civil and military activity and infrastructure and the erosion of land rights. We used Saami reindeer husbandry in Norway as a model in which to examine trends in, and to compare the influence of, both effects on a pastoral grazing system. Downscaled projections of mean annual temperature over the principal winter pasture area (Finnmarksvidda) closely matched empirical observations across 34 years to 2018. The area, therefore, is not only warming but seems likely to continue to do so. Warming notwithstanding, 50-year (1969-2018) records of local weather (temperature, precipitation and characteristics of the snowpack) demonstrate considerable annual and decadal variation which also seems likely to continue and alternately to amplify and to counter net warming. Warming, moreover, has both positive and negative effects on ecosystem services that influence reindeer. The effects of climate change on reindeer pastoralism are evidently neither temporally nor spatially uniform, nor indeed is the role of climate change as a driver of change in pastoralism even clear. The effects of human intervention on the system, by contrast, are clear and largely negative. Gradual liberalization of grazing rights from the 18th Century has been countered by extensive loss of reindeer pasture. Access to similar to 50% of traditional winter pasture was lost in the 19th Century owing to the closure of international borders to the passage of herders and their reindeer. Subsequent to this the area of undisturbed pasture within Norway has decreased by 71%. Loss of pasture due to piecemeal development of infrastructure and to administrative encroachment that erodes herders' freedom of action on the land that remains to them, are the principal threats to reindeer husbandry in Norway today. These tangible effects far exceed the putative effects of current climate change on the system. The situation confronting Saami reindeer pastoralism is not unique: loss of pasture and administrative, economic, legal and social constraints bedevil extensive pastoral grazing systems across the globe.","Arctic and climate change and encroachment and grazing rights and infrastructure and pastoralism and reindeer and Saami and RANGIFER-TARANDUS-TARANDUS and SEMI-DOMESTICATED REINDEER and PLANT COMMUNITY RESPONSES and WILD REINDEER and WOODLAND CARIBOU and HABITAT SELECTION and POPULATION TRENDS and MIGRATORY CARIBOU and POWER-LINES and RANGE USE","10.3389/fsufs.2020.585685     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.585685",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Summarised evidence"

International law applicable to Indigenous peoples played a significant role in the argumentation of the decision, which leads to the question of state compliance with the norms and rules laid down in international law. Given how important the decision was for the reindeer herding communities, the reasoning behind it calls for further investigation. The ministerial decision on the planned Kalvvatnan wind power project re-examined the judgment of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and refused to license the building of a plant due to the reindeer herding communities’ concerns. These concerns are enshrined in the procedural and material requirements of international legal standards, in particular Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the context of increased conflicts between large-scale industries and Indigenous livelihoods, I will examine the outcome of the Kalvvatnan case to discuss state application of international law.

The Nordic countries, with a great range of natural conditions but historically similar social and political structures, provide an opportunity to compare restoration approaches and efforts across borders. The aim of this study was to explore variation in ecological restoration using the Nordic countries as an example. We used recent national assessments and expert evaluations of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts differed among countries: forest and peatland restoration was most common in Finland, freshwater restoration was most common in Sweden, restoration of natural heathlands and grasslands was most common in Iceland, restoration of natural and semi-cultural heathlands was most common in Norway, and restoration of cultural ecosystems, mainly abandoned agricultural land, was most common in Denmark. Ecological restoration currently does not occur on the Faroe Islands. Economic incentives influence ecological restoration and depend on laws and policies in each country.

Many of the alpine national parks in southern Norway hold the last remaining populations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Therefore management needs more effective tools to reduce or remove recreational impact on wild reindeer populations. Management actions should also consult research-based knowledge on visitors. Therefore, this study explores the link between visitor motivations and their attitudes towards management actions on track-related (trail, path, trampling, track) and area-related (zoning, legal restrictions) use. The results show that two of the visitor motivations (i.e. hiking and place attachment) affect visitors’ attitudes towards management restrictions on use significantly. For instance, those visiting the national park for hiking are more positive to area-related restrictions while individuals attached to the place are more positive to track-related restrictions. Practical and theoretical implications are also discussed. Management implications When attempting to find socio-ecological solutions for conflicts between a wild reindeer population and recreational use, the following management recommendations should be considered: – A management solution should regard the fact that local users differ significantly from non-local visitors. – The strategy of ‘area restriction’ is highly controversial for local communities, due to their long tradition with subsistence harvesting, grazing and traditional agriculture; therefore such a strategy will receive only low approval among the locals and leave the management with low legitimacy at the local level. – The strategy of ‘management of the track system’ will affect most non-local visitors, but these visitors are more flexible in adapting to a new trail system in the area, or may shift to another area. – Visitors with strong place attachment, as well as wilderness seekers who desire solitude are difficult to influence with physical management actions. – A management strategy that will limit the area of use and behaviour of off-track visitors should include information about ecosystem vulnerability.","Motivation","10.1016/j.jort.2015.04.004","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2015.04.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

A systematic review of the social and ecological impacts of the establishment of protected areas","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

Unlike other types of renewable energies such as wind and hydroelectricity, evidence on the effects of PV installations on biodiversity has been building up only fairly recently and suggests that they may directly impact ecosystems and species through, for instance, habitat change and loss, mortality, behaviour alteration or population displacements. Hence, we conducted a systematic map of existing evidence aiming at answering the following question: what evidence exists regarding the effects of PV installations on wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species? Methods: We searched for relevant citations on four online publication databases, on Google Scholar, on four specialised websites and through a call for grey literature. Citations were then screened for eligibility in order to only retain citations referring to wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species as well as PV and solar thermal installations, therefore excluding concentrated solar power. Accepted articles were first split into studies (corresponding to one experimental design) subjected to critical appraisal and then further split into observations (i.e. one population and one outcome) during metadata extraction. The current state of the literature was characterised and knowledge clusters and gaps identified. Review findings: Searching captured 8121 unique citations, which resulted in 158 relevant articles being accepted after screening. Even though the first article was published in 2005, the publication rate increased rapidly in 2020. The 97 included primary research and modelling articles were split into 137 unique studies and rated with either a low (43.8%), a high (41.6%) or an unclear overall risk of bias (14.6%) after internal validity assessment. Studies were further split into 434 observations, mainly carried out in the United States (23.0%) and the United Kingdom (21.0%), preferentially in temperate climates (64.5%). Plants and arthropods were the two most studied taxa (41.7% and 26.3%, respectively). Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) facilities were most often investigated (70.1%). Observations mainly focused on the effect of the presence of PV installations (51.8%). Species abundance, community composition and species diversity were the most common outcomes assessed (23.0%, 18.4% and 16.1%, respectively). Conclusions: Three knowledge clusters for which a systematic review should be contemplated were identified: (i) the effects of PV installations on plant and (ii) arthropod communities and, (iii) their effects at a larger ecosystem scale on overall species abundance. However, the currently available evidence regarding the effects of photovoltaic installations on biodiversity is still scarce. More research is urgently needed on non-flying mammals and bats as well as amphibians and reptiles. Solar thermal panels and floating PV installations should also be further investigated. Studies comparing different designs of PV installations, management practices or contexts should be conducted as well. Indeed, more evidence is still needed to allow decision-makers to accurately and reliably select the types of PV installations and management practices that are least damaging to biodiversity. © 2023, The Author(s).","Conservation and Energy transition and Evidence synthesis and Floating solar and Green infrastructure and Ground-mounted photovoltaic and Solar panels and Wildlife","10.1186/s13750-023-00318-x","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-023-00318-x",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Multiple ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

We reviewed the literature for empirical evidence that ecotourism protects forests. Our conclusions are at once both sobering and encouraging. Ecotourism, as it is typically practiced, leads to deforestation. However, when accompanied by conservation mechanisms (e.g. protected area, Payment for Ecosystem Services, monitoring/enforcement), ecotourism can protect forests. Ecotourism sometimes leads to forest regeneration in agrarian landscapes, but trade-offs, for example old-growth deforestation or water pollution, may occur. From a methodological perspective, we found a dearth (only 17) of articles that empirically analyzed ecotourism impacts on forests, and no studies that used counterfactual impact evaluation approaches. We conclude that there is an insufficient evidence base for inferring effects of ecotourism on forests, and we identify research priorities to build knowledge about how, when, and where to implement ecotourism.","LAND-USE CHANGE and PROTECTED AREAS and CONSERVATION and TOURISM and DEFORESTATION and REGION and DEGRADATION and RESERVE","10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Forest","Summarised evidence"

Reindeer nomadic husbandry is a coupled social-ecological system that sustains resilience by interacting with the animals and environment: either the herders adjust their actions to animal behavior or change this behavior in ways that suit the herd and pastures. Stressors and shocks affecting Sámi reindeer husbandry are, for instance, sudden warm air temperatures with subsequent snow melting and freezing in winter, bad grazing conditions, loss of grazing lands, and even socio-economic reforms. All these are sudden, unprepared, or forced changes. Climate change resilience includes using reindeer herders’ Indigenous knowledge of selective breeding by maintaining different phenotypes of reindeer such as non-productive and castrated animals in the herd. Nevertheless, in Sámi reindeer husbandry in Norway today, low numbers of male reindeer and the absence of castrated animals challenge the herders’ resilience coping strategies. This chapter discusses factors that constrain resilience in herding societies, contribute to the transformation of reindeer husbandry and the erosion of resilience in the herding society. © The Author(s) 2024.","Reindeer husbandry and Social-ecological resilience and Tipping points in reindeer husbandry and Thinking","10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

However, these two perspectives approach land from different ends and it can be difficult to see how studied variables contribute to broader policy goals. In this paper, we argue that there is a need to better select variables to study land systems as social-ecological systems, and to align research more with those policy goals. Concentrating on the European continent, we pursue three interrelated objectives: we (1) build a classification of land systems variables, (2) examine where existing land systems research is positioned in this classification, and (3) compare a set of policies and science-policy frameworks with the classified research. To do so, we conduct a systematic review of 69 peer-reviewed, empirical land systems papers, as well as four overarching policies and science-policy frameworks. We find that over 60% of the reviewed papers include both environmental and social variables, and we identify 154 unique variables studied, 57% of which are environmental. The average paper examines four times as many environmental variables as social ones. We find that policies and science-policy frameworks stress social variables more and include health and air quality aspects that are lacking in the reviewed land systems research. Our classification can help to design research that includes both social and environmental variables and is aligned with broader policy goals. We highlight social variables with available spatial data to encourage a more balanced and integrative social-ecological research design, going beyond a focus on the built and natural environment. Our classification can contribute to guiding land systems researchers towards greater policy relevance. We hope that our classification contributes to a conversation within land systems research on the selection of variables, as well as its further development.","Land use and Land cover and Science-policy and Land change and Rural systems and SDGs and Pattern and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and DRIVERS and CHALLENGES and FOREST and OPPORTUNITIES and ABANDONMENT and INTENSITY and PATTERNS and LANDSCAPES and EMERGENCE","10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.034     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.034",NA,NA,"European","Land use in general","Summarised evidence"

While we know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of information about many mustelids. We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as “the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon”. We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines. © 2022 The Authors.

While anchored into legislation, residual or chronic impacts can occur after offset establishment. Advice and best practice on how to approach these impacts is rare. To address this, we reviewed 30 projects based on a systematic review and meta-analysis in freshwater ecosystems dealing with residual or long-term negative impacts to provide application advice for: habitat creation, habitat restoration, and biological and chemical manipulation. Project information was obtained through Boolean search terms and web-scraping. Habitat creation projects had a pooled effect size of 0.8 and offsetting ratios of 1:5 with high biomass increases of >140% compared to pre-establishment, associated with them. Habitat restoration projects targeted a wide range of species and communities with a pooled effect size of 0.66, offset ratios ranging from 1:1.2 to 1:4.6, and biomass increases generally > 100% compared to pre-restoration. Biological manipulation had the lowest effect size (0.51) with stocking being highly variable both in terms of biomass benefits and project outcomes pointing towards being mostly applicable in cases of direct fish harm not related to habitat aspects. We conclude that (1) all three assessed approaches have a potential application use for offsetting residual or chronic harm with approach-specific caveats. (2) Implementation costs differ across offset methods, with connectivity and side-channel projects having the lowest biomass gain per area costs (3) Time to first benefits required one to two years with time lags needing to be accounted for in the implementation and monitoring process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aquatic Ecosystems and Compensation and Meta-analysis and Mitigation and Residual harm and Systematic Review and Animals and Biodiversity and Biomass and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Fishes and Fresh Water and Aquatic ecosystems and Chemical analysis and Fish and Project management and Restoration and Water and fresh water and Anthropogenic impacts and Effect size and Freshwater fishes and Habitat creation and Habitat restoration and aquatic ecosystem and biomass and fish and freshwater ecosystem and habitat management and literature review and meta-analysis and mitigation and strategic approach and aquatic environment and article and compensation and effect size and freshwater environment and freshwater fish and habitat and human and meta analysis and nonhuman and systematic review and animal and biodiversity and ecosystem and environmental protection","10.1007/s00267-022-01703-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-022-01703-x",NA,NA,"Global","Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

We applied systematic review and meta-analytical methods to robustly assess evidence on the impact of matrix structure on movement rates, with the hypothesis that movement will be greater through matrix of a more similar structure (vegetation height and cover) to the home habitat. Twenty studies of movement through two or more different matrix types provided 107 effect sizes, expressing the difference between the relative movement rates in different matrix types. The studies were all on animals, including relatively mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies but also rodents and amphibians. We were able to detect that on average, movement was greater through matrix of a more similar structure to the species' habitat despite the variation in studies in terms of matrix types, species and methods. The effect size was larger when there was a greater difference in the structure of the two matrix types being compared (e.g. comparing grassland to forest rather than short grass to long grass). However, there was a high degree of covariation between matrix contrast and studies and other significant subgroupings such as taxonomic group and matrix openness. The biological significance of the increase in movement is not clear; however, ecological theory predicts dispersing individuals are important for population dynamics. Changes to the structure of landscapes intended to improve permeability to movement are supported by the findings of this study, particularly for relatively mobile species. However, research over longer timescales, greater distances and range of taxonomic groups is necessary.","Connectivity and Emigration and Dispersal and Permeability and Resistance and Risk ratio and CLIMATE-CHANGE and LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY and HABITAT AREA and DISPERSAL and CONSERVATION and DYNAMICS and BEHAVIOR and FOREST and DECISIONS and RESPONSES","10.1007/s10980-012-9781-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-012-9781-9",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important. Empirical research in this field can aid in solving conflicts between socio-economic demands for ecosystem services and nature conservation of LFRs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity and Biological integrity and Conservation and Ecological condition and Ecological integrity and Ecological status and Ecosystem services and Rehabilitation and Restoration and Rivers and Parapotamon and Banks (bodies of water) and Commerce and Economic and social effects and Floods and Image reconstruction and Patient rehabilitation and Ecological conditions and assessment method and biodiversity and conservation management and ecosystem service and environmental conditions and environmental restoration and floodplain and Index of Biotic Integrity and literature review and river and strategic approach and trade-off and watershed and Ecosystems","10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.026","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.026",NA,NA,"Global","Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"
"491","rayyan-674253467","A systematic review of ecological attributes that confer resilience to climate change in environmental restoration","PLOS ONE","Ecological restoration is widely practiced as a means of rehabilitating ecosystems and habitats that have been degraded or impaired through human use or other causes. Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual-(9), population-(6), community-(7), ecosystem-(7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species-or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. We propose that identifying sources of ecological resilience is a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate.","EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA and LONG-TERM IMPACTS and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and GENETIC DIVERSITY and MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES and COMMUNITY PERSISTENCE and FUNCTIONAL RESILIENCE and RESPONSE DIVERSITY and RIPARIAN CORRIDORS and CORAL-REEFS","10.1371/journal.pone.0173812     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173812",NA,NA,"Global","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined. Aims. Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective. Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools. Key results. Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7). Conclusions. Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline. Implications. Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.","hunting and human-wildlife interactions and sharp-shooting and vertebrate pest and wildlife management and WHITE-TAILED DEER and EARN-A-BUCK and NEW-ZEALAND and BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION and PEST MAMMALS and WILD BOAR and MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and FOX and PREDATION","10.1071/WR19129     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1071/WR19129",NA,NA,"Global","Multiple but not stated","Summarised evidence"

We systematically reviewed 126 relevant papers that study the impact of outdoor recreation on wildlife, focusing on terrestrial wildlife (birds excluded) to assess the different methodological approaches adopted by researchers. We characterised the research methods into seven categories (direct observation, indirect observation (field-based), telemetry, camera traps, physiological measurement, trapping, and simulation). We find that direct observation is the most commonly used method to capture human-wildlife interactions, followed by the use of telemetry, and camera traps. The animals most commonly studied were ungulates, and the orders Carnivora and Rodentia. Studies typically captured data over longer periods (median 54 months) when using trapping methods; other methods exhibited shorter study durations (median 22 months). The size of the animal under study appears to influence how methods are chosen, with larger species often being studied using telemetry methods. We highlight advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on the aims of the study, the focal species, and the type of outdoor recreation. Our review highlights the need for simultaneous measurements of both human activity and wildlife response. We also recommend that researchers consider how to capture both short- and long-term impacts on animal welfare. Our findings should guide applied wildlife conservation and management research in scenarios where human-wildlife interactions lead to conservation issues. © 2020","Data collection and Human-wildlife conflict and Method and Outdoor recreation and Review","10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00917","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00917",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

Species selection for, and maintenance of naturalistic plantings are key to their success. While herbaceous and grassy meadows can be mowed, naturalistic plantings with woody plants require more intense maintenance to remove biomass and promote resprouting. We aim to understand woody plant responses to diverse disturbance regimes to potentially inform the selection and management of woody species in urban plantings. We conducted a quantitative systematic literature review of 72 papers and investigated what main external (climate, disturbance regime) and internal (buds, life stage, storage reserves) factors influence the resprouting response of woody plants. We found resprouting literature is geographically widespread for woody plants, but studies are skewed towards Temperate climates in USA and Australia, with a focus on high severity and high frequency fire disturbance. Resprouting response was mostly defined as a continuous response to disturbance dependent on disturbance regime, climate and plant traits. Maintenance and management of naturalistic woody plantings, through hard pruning techniques such as coppicing, may be informed by analogous high severity and high frequency disturbance studies. However, the literature on woody plant resprouting has several knowledge gaps for lower severity and lower frequency disturbance regimes and in more arid climates. Future research should evaluate the response of naturalistic woody plantings to disturbance in specific urban contexts. © 2024 The Authors.

This article reviews published evaluations of restoration efforts on the ground and those identified or proposed in the literature. This review found few reports of the effectiveness of restoration measures, and of those reported there was strong temporal and geographical bias. Reports were mostly recent and took place within mussel-diverse regions of the Global North (i.e. North America, Europe). Efforts focused on population support encompassed relocation, translocation and population augmentation from captive breeding, and potential restoration approaches emphasized planning and prioritization. It was challenging to assess restoration success owing to differences in success metrics and varied lengths of post-restoration monitoring. Some measures were inherently more species specific, such as population support, but some articles suggested that the use of multiple measures may allow more species to be addressed by restoration efforts. Consistent documentation and reporting of restoration measures - including failed ones - are needed to advance freshwater mussel restoration. In addition, continued work is needed to accelerate and better align the development and use of restoration approaches for freshwater mussels. Reporting of unsuccessful or partially successful attempts does not adequately reflect the long life histories of freshwater mussels. Investigation of the contexts where approaches have been effective (even partially), and concerted efforts to implement combinations of measures at a catchment scale are critical for unionids globally. As such, recommendations are posed to aid integration of research and practice to advance and further develop freshwater mussel restoration.","augmentation and conservation and freshwater mussels and relocation and restoration and synthesis and translocation and Unionida and MARGARITIFERA-MARGARITIFERA and UNIONID MUSSELS and ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION and DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA and CONSERVATION and BIODIVERSITY and POPULATION and RELOCATION and BIVALVIA and NORTH","10.1002/aqc.3750","https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3750",NA,NA,"Global","Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management.

However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.","Biodiversity and Species richness and Urban green space and Urban agriculture and Urban gardens and Wildlife and SPECIES RICHNESS and EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE and LANDSCAPE DRIVERS and GARDENS and ABUNDANCE and DIVERSITY and FUTURE and CONSERVATION and LAND and CITY","10.1007/s11252-018-0748-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-018-0748-8",NA,NA,"Global","Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Yet freshwater biodiversity is continuing to decline rapidly. To date there has been no formal review of the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving or restoring biodiversity in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. We present the first assessment using a systematic review of the published scientific evidence of the effectiveness of freshwater protected areas. Systematic searches returned 2,586 separate publications, of which 44 provided quantitative evidence comprising 75 case studies. Of these, 38 reported positive, 25 neutral, and 12 negative outcomes for freshwater biodiversity conservation. Analysis revealed variable relationships between conservation effectiveness and factors such as taxa assessed, protected area size and characteristics, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) protected area category, and ecoregion. Lack of effectiveness was attributed to many anthropogenic factors, including fishing (often with a lack of law enforcement), water management (abstraction, dams, and flow regulation), habitat degradation, and invasive non-native species. Drawing on the review and wider literature we distil eight lessons to enhance the effectiveness of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation. We urge policymakers, protected area managers, and those who fund them to invest in well-designed research and monitoring programs and publication of evidence of protected area effectiveness. © 2019 The Authors.

Small rivers in agricultural landscapes are especially exposed to excessive technical actions implemented in order to allow for harvesting river water for irrigation, draining agricultural water and receiving sewage. Regular dredging and macrophyte removal strongly interfere with the global need for preserving river biodiversity that allows agricultural lowland rivers to remain refuges for a variety of species, and-accordingly-to keep water bodies resilient for the benefit of society. In order to provide a comprehensive look at the influence of agricultural lowland river management on the ecological status of these water bodies, we conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis. For the structured literature review we selected 203 papers reflecting on the response of aquatic ecosystems to dredging and macrophyte management actions. The database of scientific contributions developed for our study consists of papers written by the authors from 33 countries (first authorship) addressing dredging, macrophyte removal, status of fish and macroinvertebrates as well as the general ecological status of lowland agricultural rivers. We revealed that 96% of the analyzed papers indicated unilateral, negative responses of aquatic ecosystems, particularly macroinvertebrates, ichthyofauna and macrophyte composition, to maintenance measures. We revealed that studies conducted in the European Union on the ecological status of rivers appeared to significantly increase in quantity after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Finally, we concluded that day-to-day management of lowland agricultural rivers requires revision in terms of compliance with environmental conservation requirements and the recurrent implementation of technical measures for river maintenance.

Following screening, a small number of articles (40) were found relevant, representing studies quantifying non-point source nutrient losses from urban and peri-urban environments. Evidence was split between plot- and catchment-scale. Plot-scale studies often included evaluations of engineered nature-based solutions. At catchment-scale, studies of streamwater quality typically investigated influence of contributory catchment nutrient sources. Wide ranges of beneficial reductions were apparent, and at both scales not all studies identified significant benefits. Summarizing against this backdrop, at plot (micro-) scale woodland reduces mean concentrations in runoff, soil or groundwater by an average of 44.2% for total nitrogen (TN) and 47.0% for total phosphorus (TP). At catchment (meso-) scale, evidence suggests a 20% areal addition of forest at the expense of mixed urban fabric can reduce mean concentrations by 15.7% and 12.6% for TN and TP respectively. Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts. Canopy cover suppresses stream channel biological nitrogen uptake, which based on all evidence appears considerable. However, unshaded headwaters can foster accelerated primary productivity with undesirable downstream consequences. Overall, gathering further evidence is encouraged, given current uncertainties, especially to address differences between impervious, permeable and riparian urban woodland settings.","forest and tree and river and leaf litter and riparian and impervious and water quality and nitrogen and phosphorus and WATER-QUALITY and LEAF-LITTER and LAND-USE and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and NITROGEN and PHOSPHORUS and STREAM and FOREST and EXPORT and IMPACTS","10.1029/2022WR032626     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032626",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Forest","Summarised evidence"

Conflict between humans and large carnivores hinders carnivore conservation worldwide. Livestock depredations by large carnivores is the main cause of conflict, triggering poaching and retaliatory killings by humans. Resolving this conflict requires an understanding of the factors that cause large carnivores to select livestock over wild prey. Individual studies to date report contradictory results about whether wild prey density affects livestock depredation by large carnivores. 2. We carried out a systematic review of grey wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences. We reviewed and analysed 119 grey wolf dietary studies from 27 countries to determine whether wild prey or livestock density affects grey wolf dietary selection. 3. We also assessed whether there are traits that predispose species to be preyed upon (body size, group size, defence mechanisms, speed), and whether livestock management is a factor that affects selection of livestock by grey wolves. 4. Overall, wild prey (65% of the total frequency of occurrence in all reviewed grey wolf diet studies) was selected for even when livestock was abundant. The average proportion of biomass percentage in grey wolf diets was 13% for livestock and 19% for wild species. 5. Wild prey species in possession of defence mechanisms (horns, antlers, spikes, and fangs), with high body weight and present in high density were more likely to be depredated by grey wolves. 6. Even when prey abundance significantly affected selection of wild prey, livestock predation was much lower considering their substantially higher density. Areas where livestock were left to graze freely in small numbers (<20 individuals/km2) were more vulnerable to grey wolf attacks. 7. Our results suggest that the adoption of attack prevention measures on pastures and the increase of wild prey abundance could reduce depredation on livestock by grey wolves, and in turn, provide better opportunities for coexistence between humans, grey wolves and livestock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation and Feeding ecology and Human-wildlife conflict and Prey selection and Wolf diet and Canidae and Canis lupus and canid and carnivore and coexistence and conservation management and dietary intake and livestock farming and nature-society relations and prey availability and prey selection","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108433","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108433",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

One main reason for this decline is the lack of suitable nesting sites. While some off-field measures showed positive effects on bird productivity, we are currently not achieving sufficient conservation with these, so that supplementing them with in-field measures seems inevitable. Over the past years, several in-field measures have been developed aiming at providing suitable nesting sites in crop fields by manipulating the crop architecture, i.e., the density and/or height of the crops. However, we currently lack an overview on what has been tested and resulted in stabilizing population of ground-breeding farmland birds. In this systematic review, we provide a qualitative assessment of current knowledge and knowledge gaps on such in-field measures and their effects on European crop-breeding farmland birds. In doing so, we accounted for specific birds’ requirements on their breeding habitat. We found only very few studies on the effectiveness of crop architecture-related in-field measures on ground-breeding farmland birds. Knowledge gaps exist for effects on individual species in general, their reproduction (rather than population density), the influence of landscape and local contexts on the effectiveness, and the optimal spatial arrangement of measures to maximize their efficiency. This shows an urgent need for more research on a holistic scale. However, the few existing studies suggest, that there is a high potential for crop architecture-related in-field measures to promote ground-breeding farmland birds, and thus bring them back as ‘agricultural by-products’. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecological intensification and Sward heterogeneity and Sward homogeneity and Sward structure and Vegetation density and Vegetation structure and biodiversity and conservation management and environmental assessment and heterogeneity and homogeneity and nature conservation","10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126515","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126515",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Four factors were identified to impact birds near roads: habitat quality, species-specific traits, traffic noise, and infrastructure. Although early work identified traffic noise as the main selective force, recent studies lend more support to habitat quality and infrastructure. However, this literature was deemed to possess low inferential strength given inconsistent data collection, inadequate management of confounding variables, limited inclusion of vehicle-free environments, short-term experimental timeframes, and use of methodologies susceptible to bias.

A systematic review of alternative trajectories in Europe","Land Use Policy","Agricultural land abandonment and its impacts on landscape features have been a, striking characteristic of many European rural areas over the last decades. Although, previous research identified drivers and environmental impacts of abandonment, few, described the post-agricultural abandonment trajectories. However, examining the, driving forces leading to different post-agricultural abandonment trajectories is key to, understand how alternative uses of these lands can be developed to address the, environmental, economic, and social challenges faced in these areas. This paper, reviews the literature of the different trajectories observed after agricultural, abandonment and the related drivers and processes. Based on the literature evidence, we proposed a novel categorisation of different abandonment trajectories, with their, drivers and landscape outcomes. In most reported cases, lands transitioned towards, semi-natural landscapes and few returned to different agricultural uses after, abandonment. The most common driving force of the landscape trajectory was the, absence of land management where secondary succession processes led to seminatural, landscapes. Quality and state of these landscapes were variable. Alternative, trajectories were essentially driven by institutional and socio-economic drivers within, biophysical constraints and opportunities for (re-)afforestation, re-farming, and multifunctional, uses of the land after abandonment. While abandoned lands can bring, opportunities to respond to biodiversity and other environmental policy goals, the, evidence across case studies suggests that adequate resources with institutional and, socio-economic incentives are required to stimulate favourable development, mitigate, potential trade-offs, and support land management. © 2021 The Authors","Driving forces and Land abandonment and Land use change and Landscape change and Secondary succession and Europe and abandoned land and agricultural land and land use change and landscape change and rural area and secondary succession","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105833","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105833",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

A considerable primary literature exists on this topic, therefore it is important to assess whether this accumulated evidence can be used to reach general conclusions concerning vegetation vulnerability to inform conservation management decisions. Experimental trampling studies on a global scale were retrieved using a systematic review methodology and synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. The relationships between vegetation recovery and each of initial vegetation resistance, trampling intensity, time for recovery, Raunkiaer life-form (perennating bud position), and habitat were tested using random effects multiple meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The systematic search yielded 304 studies; of these, nine reported relevant randomized controlled experiments, providing 188 vegetation recovery effect sizes for analysis. The synthesis indicated there was significant heterogeneity in the impact of trampling on vegetation recovery. This was related to resistance and recovery time, and the interactions of these variables with Raunkiaer life-form, but was not strongly dependent on the intensity of the trampling experienced. The available evidence suggests that vegetation dominated by hemicryptophytes and geophytes recovers from trampling to a greater extent than vegetation dominated by other life-forms. Variation in effect within the chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte and geophyte life-form sub-groups was also explained by the initial resistance of vegetation to trampling, but not by trampling intensity. Intrinsic properties of plant communities appear to be the most important factors determining the response of vegetation to trampling disturbance. Specifically, the dominant Raunkiaer life-form of a plant community accounts for more variation in the resilience of communities to trampling than the intensity of the trampling experienced, suggesting that simple assessments based on this trait could guide decisions concerning sustainable access to natural areas. Methodological and reporting limitationsmust be overcome before more disparate types of evidence can be synthesised; this would enable more reliable extrapolation to non-study situations, and a more comprehensive understanding of how assessments of intrinsic plant traits can be used to underpin conservation management decisions concerning access.","Recreation and Relative vegetation cover and Evidence-based management and Plant functional traits and Resilience and Public access and Raunkiaer life-form and EVIDENCE-BASED CONSERVATION and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and RECREATION IMPACTS and NATIVE VEGETATION and BRITTANY FRANCE and DISTURBANCE and FOREST and MANAGEMENT and RESISTANCE and HEATHLAND","10.7717/peerj.360     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.360",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Improvements require changes in farming practices, but empirical evidence on farmers’ motivations underlying their on-farm biodiversity management remains fragmented. To date, there is no aggregated overview of behavioural determinants that influence European farmers’ decisions to implement biodiversity-friendly farming practices. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 150 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022. We identified 108 potential determinants of farmers’ behaviour, which were integrated into a multilevel framework. The results show that the farmers’ decisions are complex and often non-directional processes, shaped by numerous external (at a society, landscape, community, and farm level) and internal factors. These factors are embedded in regional and cultural contexts. However, the analysis of study sites indicates that the spatial coverage of scientific evidence on biodiversity-friendly farming measures is uneven across Europe. Given the diversity of local and socio-cultural conditions, there is a need for public policies, including the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, to address more specifically determinants encouraging biodiversity-friendly farm management. This entails reflecting culture-specific perspectives and incorporating experiential knowledge into multilevel policy design processes, as well as offering regionally adapted advice on measure implementation and biodiversity impacts. © 2023, The Author(s).","Agri-environment-climate measures (AECM) and Biodiversity management and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Environmental perception and Sustainable farming and Systematic literature review","10.1007/s10460-023-10505-8","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10505-8",NA,NA,NA,"Farmland","Summarised evidence"

To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their rela-tionships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being.

An evidence-based approach","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","Anthropogenic modification of the countryside has resulted in much of the landscape consisting of fragments of once continuous habitat. Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or longterm monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation. The benefits of such corridors in regard to increasing habitat connectivity remain equivocal, and the role of corridors in mitigating the effects of climate change at the landscape-scale is even less well understood.","climate change and connectivity and conservation and habitat fragmentation and habitat loss and landscape-scale and movement and population and systematic review and woodland fauna and CLIMATE-CHANGE and AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES and ABAX PARALLELEPIPEDUS and POPULATION-DYNAMICS and BEETLE COMMUNITIES and BIRD COMMUNITIES and HESPERIA-COMMA and FARM WOODLANDS and SMALL MAMMALS and CONSERVATION","10.1007/s10980-006-9064-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-006-9064-4",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distriuted windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anscriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are require. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.","birds and environmental impact assessment and environmental policy and meta-analysis and renewable energy and systematic review and CONSERVATION PRACTICE and ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT and METAANALYSIS and SUPPORT and FARMS and MANAGEMENT","10.1017/S0376892907003554     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892907003554",NA,NA,NA,"Mountains","Summarised evidence"

Some of the surviving fragments are managed as pasture but the grazing regime required to maintain their relict flora is unproven. We conducted a systematic review and analysed available data to ascertain the impact of grazing on species richness and the abundance of important plant species. We found the evidence base to be poor but with some potential for meaningful integration of existing datasets. Analyses of complementary datasets from Welsh mesotrophic grassland demonstrates that livestock type and vegetation height significantly impact on the plant community composition. However, the differences in species richness and forb abundance between livestock types are not ecologically significant, and grazing intensity appears to be more important than species of grazer. Managers must balance changes in bryophyte abundance, forb diversity and plant species richness to achieve tradeoffs appropriate to their conservation objectives. The poor evidence base necessitates flexible, site-based management and rigorous monitoring where grazing of important mesotrophic pastures is undertaken. Further evidence regarding interactions between grazing intensity and livestock type is noticeably lacking, precluding prediction regarding livestock type impacts at given stocking intensities. Lack of detailed knowledge of land-use history is a major impediment and there is little information regarding taxa other than vascular plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Peer-reviewed research publications on tree retention from studies performed in the three countries were analyzed and about 50 relevant biodiversity studies were found, with the first published in 1994. Most studies were directed towards beetles and dead wood, especially high stumps.

Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation.","bird conservation and culling and evidence-based conservation and hatching success and meta-analysis and predator eradication and systematic review methodology and ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT and MESOPREDATOR RELEASE and MAMMALIAN PREDATORS and NEST PREDATION and METAANALYSIS and CONSERVATION and CONFLICTS and ISLANDS and ECOLOGY and SUCCESS","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01421.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01421.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.

However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.","SEA-LEVEL RISE and HURRICANE-KATRINA and VEGETATION BIOSHIELDS and MANAGED REALIGNMENT and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and MISSISSIPPI DELTA and ELEVATION and WETLANDS and EROSION and RESTORATION","10.1371/journal.pone.0027374     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027374",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal","Summarised evidence"

Realising the role of river social-ecological systems in providing ecosystem services (ES) to society, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to identify progress, gaps and future research directions for river restoration research across the globe. We systematically reviewed articles and summarised the trends of river restoration within the explicit context of ES assessment. The economic and ecological aspects of river restoration were the prime focus of major studies, whereas social benefits have been least addressed. The results identified the research gaps and future opportunities and tried to supplement those gaps by addressing the questions that need to be researched in future studies. The proposed conceptual framework is designed how application of ES perspective help to integrate social benefits in river restoration research.

Therefore, and departing from an SRL, this paper aims to answer the main question about the sociodemographic elements that affect the SP related to protected areas. The results indicate that household income and education are linked to behaviors favoring conservation. Likewise, dissatisfaction regarding social well-being, access to natural resources and management generate behaviors that negatively affect the SP about the conservation role of protected areas.

Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat.","Beaver dams and fish migration and meta-analysis and public perception and salmon and species reintroduction and JUVENILE COHO SALMON and CUTTHROAT TROUT and ATLANTIC SALMON and BROOK TROUT and ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH and HABITAT USE and CASTOR-CANADENSIS and RIVER DRAINAGE and POPULATION-STRUCTURE and NATIONAL-PARK","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation.

A meta-analysis","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","Industrial forestry typically leads to a simplified forest structure and altered species composition. Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25years ago to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and temperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no comprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well as un-harvested forests. Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78 studies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-harvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least in the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna. Retention cuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as higher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species taken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist species and unclassified species), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts. Retention cuts had negative impacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior species may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some open-habitat species compared with clearcuts. Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of forest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were not enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on biodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on either forest species or open-habitat species, although limited data may have hindered our capacity to identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic groups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for integrating biodiversity conservation and production forestry, although identifying optimal solutions between these two goals may need further attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will not substitute for conservation actions targeting certain highly specialized species associated with forest-interior or open-habitat conditions.","biodiversity and boreal forest and clearcut and disturbance and forestry and structural retention and temperate forest and variable retention and GREEN-TREE RETENTION and PUBLICATION BIAS and USNEA-LONGISSIMA and DEAD-WOOD and HABITAT and RESPONSES and HARVESTS and FILL and TRIM and CUT","10.1111/1365-2664.12289     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12289",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Butterflies are a popular target group for fragmentation studies and represent an ideal assemblage to explore the impact and role of the matrix in patchy landscapes. To date, there has been no attempt to synthesise available research and assess the extent to which the matrix is included in studies of fragmented butterfly populations. Addressing this issue is important for improved understanding of habitat use in fragmented landscapes, and for the successful management and conservation of butterfly biodiversity. Our systematic review of 100 empirical research papers spans 50 years, and identifies how (and indeed if) the matrix is recognised in studies of butterfly populations in fragmented landscapes. We found that it was significantly more likely for studies not to include the matrix in their experimental design. This is of particular concern given 60 % of papers that excluded the matrix in their research did so in systems where the matrix was expected to contain resources of value for patch-associated species (as it was either a heterogeneous landscape or had similar structure to patches). Of the papers that did consider the matrix, 80 % (n = 24) reported a negative effect of the matrix on butterfly species and/or communities. Matrix effects may influence the survival and persistence of faunal groups in a world increasingly dominated by fragmented habitats. Our review suggests that future research should clearly define the matrix, and incorporate it in appropriate experimental designs.","Matrix and Butterfly and Lepidoptera and Review and Fragmentation and COMPLEX LIFE-CYCLES and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and PATCH SIZE and METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS and FOREST FRAGMENTATION and POLYOMMATUS-CORIDON and RELATIVE IMPORTANCE and INSECT COMMUNITIES and SPECIES RICHNESS and NATIVE FOREST","10.1007/s10841-014-9641-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-014-9641-9",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a 'boundary object'; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act as a helpful 'centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.","Anthropocene and Environmental ethics and Human-nature relations and Literature review and Natural resource management and ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and AGRICULTURAL STEWARDSHIP and EARTH STEWARDSHIP and CLIMATE-CHANGE and UNITED-STATES and MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and CERTIFICATION and GOVERNANCE","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.005     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.005",NA,NA,"Not relevant",NA,"Summarised evidence"

"537","rayyan-674236976","The influence of human values on attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation","Journal of Environmental Management","Human attitudes and behaviours have been linked to the degradation of global biodiversity, particularly forest ecosystems. Indeed, effective conservation actions require that the attitudes and behaviours of affected individuals and communities are taken into account. While several studies have examined how human attitudes and behaviours affect conservation, it is still unclear which, and how, human value orientations influence conservation attitudes and behaviour. This is critical because attitudes and behaviours are underpinned by the complex concept of human values. Thus, effective management and conservation of environmental resources requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of these values, and how they affect attitudinal and behavioural preferences towards the natural environment and their protection. Here we review the human value orientations influencing people's attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation, and discuss how conservation projects can be more successful by aligning their goals and operations to people's values. To do this, we carried out a scoping review, using the sub-Saharan Africa region as a case study, and followed the PRISMA-ScR systematic review guidelines. A narrative synthesis was adopted for data analysis. We identified different value types that fall within three broad human value orientation domains influencing forest conservation attitudes and behaviours. Anthropocentric and relational value orientations emerged as most dominant, with both positive and negative influences on a number of forest conservation attitudes and behaviours, albeit with more evidence for positive influence. The positive attitudes and behaviours were linked to utilitarian motivations and cultural beliefs and include rural support for conservation, compliance to forest rules, sustainable forest use, and participation in forest management. The values linked to dependence on forest resources, low benefits from conservation, and conservation costs, tend to trigger negative conservation attitudes and behaviours. To effectively achieve forest conservation goals, environmental managers, conservationists, and decision-makers should understand the extent and directional influence of value orientations on conservation attitudes and behaviours. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocentric values and Forest values and Relational values and Scoping review and Sub-Saharan Africa and Attitude and Biodiversity and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Forests and Humans and biodiversity and conservation management and conservation status and environmental protection and farmers attitude and forest ecosystem and forest management and public attitude and Africa south of the Sahara and data analysis and human and manager and motivation and narrative and practice guideline and review and synthesis and systematic review and attitude and ecosystem and forest","10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112857","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112857",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Forest","Summarised evidence"

Benefits of marketed goods and services provided by water withdrawals such as irrigation, water supply and hydropower production are well-known. Others, such as recreational, aesthetic, cultural and existence values of a well-preserved river flows are less studied. There is an increasing interest of policy makers to understand the benefits of costly river ecosystem restoration measures. Moreover, disregarding such benefits may turn into inter-stakeholder conflicts. This paper reviews empirically-based literature assessing environmental flows restoration/conservation. Thus, it offers the state-of-the-art on three aspects: 1) what motivations drive the socioeconomic evaluation of instream flows (policies and alternative instream flow regimes); 2) what values and benefits are associated with instream flows (e.g. the sheer existence of a well-preserved river, productive assets and cultural attributes); and 3) what methods are employed to undertake such assessments (e.g. scenario development, monetary and non-monetary valuations, and stakeholders engagement). Building on this, we propose a methodological framework for case-specific assessments of the restoration of environmental flows. This proposal combines increased stakeholder participation, better understanding of ecosystem functioning, awareness of the plurality of values and an accurate choice of valuation methods.

Despite widespread recognition that habitat fragmentation can influence food web interactions, consensus on the factors underlying variation in the impacts of fragmentation across systems remains elusive. In this study, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation and spatial habitat structure on resource consumption in terrestrial arthropod food webs. Across 419 studies, we found a negative overall effect of fragmentation on resource consumption. Variation in effect size was extensive but predictable. Specifically, resource consumption was reduced on small, isolated habitat fragments, higher at patch edges, and neutral with respect to landscape-scale spatial variables. In general, resource consumption increased in fragmented settings for habitat generalist consumers but decreased for specialist consumers. Our study demonstrates widespread disruption of trophic interactions in fragmented habitats and describes variation among studies that is largely predictable based on the ecological traits of the interacting species. We highlight future prospects for understanding how changes in spatial habitat structure may influence trophic modules and food webs.","Connectivity and edge effects and effect size and habitat fragmentation and herbivory and meta-analysis and parasitism and patch size and resource consumption and PLANT-POPULATION SIZE and SPECIALIZED HERBIVORE and SPECIES INTERACTIONS and AREA RELATIONSHIPS and CROP POLLINATION and PATCH SIZE and FOOD WEBS and LANDSCAPE and RESPONSES and DIVERSITY","10.1111/ele.12305     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12305",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 +/- 7.8% and +25.7 +/- 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 +/- 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 +/- 4.3% and -11.4 +/- 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further longterm data sets are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats - notably woodland - was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.","barrier effect and bats and habitat fragmentation and meta-analysis and roads and FORAGING BATS and BROWN BATS and CASUALTIES and JUVENILE and SIZE","10.1111/mam.12072     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/mam.12072",NA,NA,NA,"multiple (roads)","Summarised evidence"

A systematic map","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity. Methods: This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website. Results: Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively. Conclusions: This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.","Road ecology and Roadside management and Biodiversity and Species dispersal and Semi-natural grasslands and Linear landscape elements and Refugia and ROAD VERGES and RAILWAY VERGES and PLANT and HABITAT and VEGETATION and LANDSCAPE and CORRIDORS and FRAGMENTATION and CONSERVATION and COMMUNITIES","10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1",NA,NA,NA,"roadside","Summarised evidence"

Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.","conservation and effect size and grassland and grouse and Hedges' g and herbivory and GREATER SAGE-GROUSE and BREEDING SUCCESS and BLACK GROUSE and LAND-USE and MANAGEMENT and WILDLIFE and IMPACTS and CATTLE","10.1002/ece3.3287     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3287",NA,NA,NA,"Mountains","Summarised evidence"

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.","Land use conflicts and Bioenergy buffers and Energy crops and Impact matrix and Ecosystem services and Miscanthus and Switchgrass and Willow and Poplar and Biomass supply chain and SHORT-ROTATION COPPICE and MISCANTHUS X GIGANTEUS and LAND-USE CHANGE and SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION and ENERGY CROPPING SYSTEMS and POPLAR RIPARIAN BUFFERS and GREENHOUSE-GAS BALANCE and SHALLOW GROUND-WATER and NITROGEN REMOVAL and NUTRIENT REMOVAL","10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.052     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.052",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Based on a systematic literature review, this paper summarizes the empirical evidence on how different ethno-cultural groups use, perceive, prefer, and assign meaning to urban nature. I use the urban forest, defined here as all the trees in a city, as a proxy to understand this process. The 31 studies reviewed here differ widely in their lines of inquiry, research methods, urban natural setting, and conceptualizations of ethno-cultural identity. Most studies take place in the US and Europe, where the most common definition of an ethno-culturally diverse group is a person of non-European/non-White background. Most studies focus on what these groups like about a particular urban natural setting, such as an urban park; and whether they like more or less trees in a specific context (e.g. urban park). These groups usually prefer passive and social uses of urban natural areas, and more manicured/functional natural landscapes with less trees. The most common meanings associated with urban natural settings dominated by trees are social interaction and integration. The most common explanations on why these differences occur involve theories on socio-economic marginality, collectivist vs. individualist cultures, urban vs. rural lifestyles, and landscapes of origin. Future research on the topic will benefit by differentiating race from ethnicity, capturing intra-ethnic variation, capturing immigrant identities, exploring the different social, cultural, and economic factors that influence values and/or preferences, and focusing on concrete aspects of urban nature, such as urban forests.","Ethnicity and Ecosystem governance and Migration and Multiculturalism and Urban planning and Urban forestry and GREEN SPACE and OUTDOOR RECREATION and NATURE EXPERIENCE and TREE SURVIVAL and ETHNICITY and PARKS and PARTICIPATION and COMMUNITY and LEISURE and RACE","10.1016/j.ufug.2017.06.006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2017.06.006",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species’ habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power. Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species’ response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia. Given that a broader set of biodiversity aspects are to be protected, best overall biodiversity impacts for a variety of species at landscape level can be achieved by ensuring that there is a mosaic of different forests within landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Abundance and Clearcut and Continuous cover forestry and Selection system and Species richness and Trees","10.1186/s13750-020-00215-7","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00215-7",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland","Forest","Summarised evidence"

Despite its broad application, there is little evidence of its effect on biodiversity. To address this important knowledge gap, here we conducted a systematic review and a hierarchical meta-analysis of the effects of FSC on biodiversity worldwide. Our review yielded 57 studies spanning 2004–2022. Most studies were in the Americas and Europe (31 % and 28 %, respectively), and largely focused on vascular plants (41 %). Half (51 %) of the studies aimed to determine the effect of FSC certification on biodiversity. There were 15 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, resulting in 231 effect sizes for mammal, bird, and vascular plant abundance and 10 for vascular plant richness. Overall, there is a neutral effect of certification on taxa abundance, with only a positive effect on mammal assemblages. Responses varied considerably between mammals' traits. Threatened species, individuals with reduced body weight, and omnivorous species benefit from management under the FSC scheme. Vascular plant richness exhibited significantly higher values in FSC-certified areas. Moreover, the abundance of vascular plants also differs among traits, with shrubs and adult trees benefiting from FSC certification. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in biodiversity responses to FSC, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. The overall neutral effect and the divergent responses of taxa and species traits suggest that taxa/species-specific management and improvement of FSC criteria are required. © 2023","Biodiversity conservation and Forest certification and Forest stewardship council and Meta-analysis and Review and Animals and Biodiversity and Certification and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Humans and Mammals and Trees and Conservation and Forestry and Forest Certification and Forest certification schemes and Forest stewardship councils and FSC certification and Knowledge gaps and Systematic Review and Vascular plant and Vascular plant richness and biodiversity and certification and forest management and literature review and meta-analysis and species diversity and species richness and adult tree and bird and body weight and conservation biology and effect size and endangered species and Europe and forest and knowledge gap and meta analysis and nonhuman and omnivore and pharmacology and review and shrub and systematic review and therapy and vascular plant and Western Hemisphere and animal and environmental protection and human and mammal and tree","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168296","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168296",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Mapping is a critical exercise that allows an understanding of the spatial distribution of the different ES in PAs. This work aims to conduct a systematic literature review on mapping ES in PAs. In order to carry out this systematic review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method was applied. The results showed an increase in the number of works between 2012 and 2023, and they were especially conducted in Europe and Asia and less in North America, South America, and Oceania. Most studies were developed in terrestrial areas, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified them into types II and IV. Most of the works followed the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classification and were mainly focused on the supply dimension. Regulating and maintenance and cultural ES were the most mapped dimensions in PAs. The most frequent provisioning ES mapped in PAs were Animals reared for nutritional purposes and Cultivated terrestrial plants grown for nutritional purposes. In regulating and maintenance, Maintaining nursery populations and habitats and Regulation of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans were the most analysed. For cultural ES, Characteristics of living systems that enable activities promoting health, recuperation, or enjoyment through active or immersive interactions and Characteristics of living systems that enable aesthetic experiences were the most mapped ES in PAs. Most works followed a quantitative approach, although the number of qualitative studies is high. Finally, most of the works needed to be validated, which may hamper the credibility of mapping ES in PAs.

"553","rayyan-674230095","Impacts of hydropeaking: A systematic review","Science of the Total Environment","Hydropower is commonly considered a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, this does not imply an absence of impacts on the riverine ecosystem, the extent of which is expected to increase in the coming years due to the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources and for the climate change. A common consequence of hydroelectric power generation is hydropeaking, which causes rapid and frequent fluctuations in the water flow downstream of hydropower plants. The review incorporates 155 relevant studies published up until November 2023 and follows a systematic review method, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which is a multi-stage systematic procedure for the identification and selection of research documents. The selected studies highlighted several prominent impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic environments. The primary effects include alterations in flow patterns, modification of water temperature, changes in sediment dynamics and fluctuations in dissolved gas levels. These alterations have been found to affect various aspects of aquatic ecosystems, including fish growth, behavior, reproductive success, habitat, and migration patterns, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, hydropeaking can also lead to habitat fragmentation, erosion, and loss of riparian vegetation, thereby impacting terrestrial ecosystems that depend on the aquatic environment. Despite the body of literature reviewed, several knowledge gaps were identified, underscoring the need for further research. There is limited understanding of the long-term ecological consequences of hydropeaking and its cumulative effects on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, there is lack of consensus regarding the quantification of ecosystem services, economic impact, soil moisture content, and weighted usable area due to flow fluctuation and global evolution of energy production from renewable energy sources. Addressing the identified research gaps is crucial for achieving a balance between energy production and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in the context of a rapidly changing global climate. © 2023 The Authors","Ecology and Flow fluctuations and Hydropeaking and PRISMA and Sediment connectivity and Thermopeaking and Animals and Ecosystem and Fishes and Power Plants and Renewable Energy and Water and Aquatic ecosystems and Climate change and Flow of water and Hydroelectric power and Hydroelectric power plants and Soil moisture and water and Aquatic environments and Energy productions and Meta-analysis and Preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analyze and Renewable energy source and Systematic Review and alternative energy and climate change and conservation and ecological impact and flow pattern and habitat fragmentation and hydroelectric power plant and literature review and macroinvertebrate and meta-analysis and power generation and water flow and water temperature and alga and Amphibia and aquatic environment and benthos and consensus and data extraction and ecology and electric power plant and energy yield and environmental aspects and related phenomena and environmental erosion and environmental impact and environmental protection and fish and flow fluctuation and flow kinetics and habitat and hydrodynamics and hydropeaking and hydropower and invertebrate and knowledge gap and land biome and microbial community and migration and nonhuman and organism community and plant and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and quantitative analysis and renewable energy and reproductive success and Review and riparian ecosystem and sediment and sediment connectivity and sediment transport and social aspect and soil moisture and thermopeaking and vegetation and water and water related phenomena and animal and ecosystem and Fossil fuels","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169251","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169251",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

To achieve environmental and societal targets, there is a clear and urgent need for more ambitious, longer-term agri-environment funding mechanisms which operate at a large scale. This is, in part, due to the recognition by national governments that shifts in policy for long-term sustainability are needed since many existing agri-environment schemes have not had the desired outcomes. The recent inclusion of conservation covenants in the UK's Environment Act demonstrates one such attempt to address this issue. Through critically analyzing the use of LTAs across the world using a systematic rapid evidence assessment approach, this article assesses the potential of these agreements to deliver landscape-scale environmental benefits and public goods that are increasingly being sought by national governments as they strive for transformative policies to prevent and mitigate environmental and climate catastrophes. Exploring the enablers and barriers to adoption, alongside examples of successful LTAs, we provide an overview from which interested parties—policymakers, land managers, and private enterprises, among others—can begin to understand the opportunities and barriers which surround these agreements. Overall, this literature review identifies several factors likely to affect the uptake of LTAs, including concerns around land managers' and stakeholders' real/perceived capacity to engage, a need for flexibility, finance structures, and how monitoring and evaluation are managed.

Other literature on urban and peri-urban agriculture has mostly studied the role of localized, intensive agricultural practices in providing food to inhabitants. The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of urban provisioning ES, particularly when implementing an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach as it can offer improved resilience and quality of life in cities. We compiled and systematically analyzed studies on urban ES and ED related to a number of EGI typologies. Our systematic review of the relevant literature via an EGI framework, identified more than 80 peer-reviewed publications that focused on ES and food production in urban areas. An EGI approach can contribute socially, economically, and environmentally to urban sustainability and food security. However, such benefits must be weighed against ED trade-offs, including: potential health risks caused by human exposure to heavy metals and organic chemical contaminants often present in urban surroundings. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for incorporating EGI into urban planning and design, and discuss novel areas for future research.","Edible forest gardens and Nature-based solutions and Urban agriculture and Urban biodiversity and Urban food security and Urban soil toxicity and INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS and COMMUNITY GARDENS and BOTANICAL GARDENS and FOREST GARDENS and PRODUCTION CAPACITY and DOMESTIC GARDEN and HEALTH-BENEFITS and RISK-ASSESSMENT and SCHOOL GARDENS and TRACE-ELEMENTS","10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.026     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.026",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

High infection levels of salmon lice, and high proportions of escaped farmed salmon in spawning rivers, appear to violate the goals in the Strategy for an Environmentally Sustainable Aquaculture Industry' set by the Norwegian government. An overview of the anadromous populations in the fjord, their status and the major threats are presented. A conservation plan with mitigation efforts consisting of seven steps is presented: (1) genetic assessment of Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout populations, (2) reducing gene flow from escapees, (3) reducing infection pressure from salmon lice, (4) conduct an assessment of the freshwater habitats for anadromous salmonids and then implement it in order to restore smolt production, (5) efforts to reduce risk of river pollution from agriculture and industry and minimize impacts from hydropower production, (6) when and where necessary and practical, plant out eyed eggs from the Norwegian Genebank to increase parr and smolt production, and finally, (7) monitor spawning populations and parr densities to evaluate potential effects of the mitigation efforts. Experience and knowledge gained through the plan will be useful for other regions with similar challenges. We call for an initiative to establish a national fund under democratic and public control, where funding can be obtained for projects which focus on mitigation efforts and conservation of salmonid populations.","Anadromous salmonids and threats and salmon farming and hydropower development and stock rehabilitation and CHINOOK SALMON and WILD and RIVER and FLOW and POPULATIONS and HYBRID and FISH and LICE and L. and CONSEQUENCES and Norway","10.1080/17451000.2013.810758     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/17451000.2013.810758",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

This may include consumptive and non-consumptive activities, with nature-based tourists being motivated to experience local culture and nature. Thus, tourism can contribute economically and socially to communities associated with protected areas, with the outcomes being both benefits and costs to local people. We carried out a systematic literature review to document and characterise the outcomes of nature-based tourism for people living in and around protected areas (terrestrial and inland waters). We evaluated 89 papers published from 1996 to 2020, most of which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The main benefits were employment, business opportunities and income, and the main costs were acculturation and abandonment of traditional lifestyle/practices, price inflation and conflict/crime. While most benefits were economic, most costs were socio-cultural. We found that benefits were most frequently experienced individually and costs experienced mostly at the collective or community levels. Inconsistencies in reporting of impacts suggests that future research should take a more consistent and systematic approach to evaluating benefits and costs of nature-based tourism from both the demographic and geographic perspectives, be more inclusive, and pay equal attention to objective and subjective measures of costs and benefits. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Local people and nature-based tourism and protected areas and socio-economic benefit and socio-economic cost and systematic literature review","10.1080/13504509.2022.2073616","https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2022.2073616",NA,NA,"Global (89 countries)","Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11–25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6–10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities.

Based on an analysis of 62 cases, we identified population growth, overlapping land rights, ethnic fragmentation, and economic inequality as the most frequently reported root causes, while rises in land prices was the most often reported proximate cause.

Systematic review and meta-analysis","Science of the Total Environment","Urban areas represent a spectrum that goes from being safe habitats for biodiversity (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, without costs to fitness) to being ecological traps (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, but with costs to fitness). Given the imminent urban expansion, it is valuable to assess how biodiversity is responding to urbanization and thus generate timely conservation strategies. We systematically review the urban ecology literature to analyze how much do we know about the role of urban areas as ecological traps. Using a formal meta-analytical approach, we test whether urban areas are functioning as ecological traps or as safe habitats for different taxonomic groups. We generated a data set of 646 effect sizes of different measures of habitat preferences and fitness from 38 papers published between 1985 and 2020. The data set covered 15 countries and 47 urban areas from four continents, including 29 animal species. Studies from North America and Europe were best represented, and birds were the most studied taxa. Overall, the meta-analysis suggests that urbanized habitats are functioning more as safe sites than as ecological traps, mainly for certain species with characteristics that have allowed them to adapt well to urban areas. That is, many of the studied species prefer more urbanized habitats over other less urbanized sites, and their fitness is not modified, or it is even increased. However, there was high heterogeneity among studies. We also performed meta-regressions to identify variables accounting for this heterogeneity across studies and we demonstrate that outcomes may depend on methodological aspects of studies, such as study design or the approach used to measure habitat preference and fitness. More research is needed for poorly studied regions and on a wider range of species before generalizations can be made on the role of urban areas for biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior and Fitness and Habitat preference and Safe habitats and Urbanization and Animals and Biodiversity and Ecosystem and Europe and North America and Conservation and Health and Urban growth and Data set and Habitat preferences and Meta-analysis and Safe habitat and Systematic Review and Urban areas and Urban habitat and anthropogenic effect and anthropogenic source and fitness and habitat fragmentation and habitat selection and meta-analysis and urbanization and article and bird and conservation biology and ecology and effect size and habitat and human and meta analysis and nonhuman and systematic review and urban area and animal and biodiversity and ecosystem and Ecosystems","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146559","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146559",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.","land-use change and monitoring and restoration and salmonid and woody debris and LARGE WOODY DEBRIS and BROWN TROUT and STREAM HABITAT and SALMO-TRUTTA and BROOK TROUT and TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES and CUTTHROAT TROUT and FISH HABITAT and AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS and RIVER RESTORATION","10.1111/fwb.12888     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12888",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"
"565","rayyan-674257702","Geography of global change and species richness in the North","ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS","Different components of global change (e.g., climate change, land use, pollution, and introduced species) continue to alter biodiversity worldwide. As northern regions are still relatively undisturbed and will likely face clear increases in temperature in the near-future, we examined the signs of biodiversity change due to anthropogenic stressors using a systematic review of previous studies. Our aim was to map where, in which way, and owing to which stressor biodiversity in northern regions has changed. We made a systematic literature search covering the years between 2000 and 2015 to obtain a comprehensive selection of recent research. As species richness was clearly the most commonly used indicator of biodiversity, we only concentrated on this aspect of biodiversity. We compared different biological groups, regions, and ecosystems. In the majority of the cases, anthropogenic stressors had decreased species richness, or had no effects on it, while increasing or multiple effects of stressors on species richness were less common. Freshwater ecosystems were most sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, as species richness often decreased owing to these stressors. The effects of land use on richness were covered relatively widely in the selected set of articles, but the effects of other components of global change on species richness require further attention. Despite the fact that pollution was not as commonly studied stressor as land use, it was the most harmful stressor type affecting species richness. Geographically, most studies were located in boreal Canada or Fennoscandia, while no studies were executed in vast circumpolar areas where the temperature rise has been greatest and the projected climate change is likely to be fast. Overall, we could find an alarmingly small set of studies that described the effects of actual anthropogenic stressors in real-life circumstances in northern high latitudes.","anthropogenic stress and Arctic and biodiversity and boreal and climate change and high latitudes and FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS and CLIMATE-CHANGE and MULTIPLE STRESSORS and BIODIVERSITY LOSS and PATTERNS and DIVERSITY and RESPONSES and THREATS and IMPACT and CONSEQUENCES","10.1139/er-2016-0085     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2016-0085",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.","abundance and biodiversity and city size and gradient length and rural and species richness and suburban and systematic review and SPECIES RICHNESS and NORTHERN EUROPE and DIVERSITY and ABUNDANCE and AVIFAUNA and ECOLOGY and BIODIVERSITY and COMMUNITIES and LANDSCAPES and CITIES","10.1111/gcb.13964     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13964",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

We conducted the first systematic review that encompasses all known potential impacts on biodiversity of the installation and operation of energy TLs, documented in the scientific literature and in a sample of Environmental Impact Studies (EIS). We examined 206 articles and 19 EIS and identified 28 impacts that correspond to biotic outcomes at the individual, population and community levels.

We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the economic valuation of the outcomes of wetland restoration. We assessed the economic methods applied, the attributes valued, and the timing of the evaluation in relation to the age of restoration along with publication trends. Research on the topic is increasing, but studies from Africa and South America are lacking. A diverse cross-disciplinary interest is notable, yet collaborations between disciplines are less frequent. Of particular concern is that only a third of the studies were undertaken postrestoration, and even fewer for restorations older than 10 years. Gaps in the knowledge base mean that our present understanding of the value achieved through wetland restoration is tentative. The need for postrestoration site-specific valuation efforts remains large both to justify further investment and to improve confidence in predictive and value transfer approaches as practical tools to inform decision-making.","ecosystem services and ecosystem valuation and restoration outcomes and wetland management and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and METAANALYSIS and PUBLICATION and MANAGEMENT and BENEFITS and VALUES and BIAS","10.1111/rec.12889     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.12889",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

Today however, agroecosystems undergo biophysical changes because of land-use and management changes (LUMC), such as intensive agriculture, urbanisation, and land abandonment. Typically, environmental conflicts emerge between stakeholders with differing interests in land areas around the LUMC. Cumulatively, these changes and conflicts have substantial influence on the CES appreciation of the farmland, triggering different types of responses, including social mobilisation and resistance. A comprehensive analysis of these processes was missing in the literature. Here we present a systematic review of CES provided by agroecosystems at the global level, we explore their interconnections through network analysis, and analyse the interrelation between LUMC, CES and environmental conflicts. The review includes 155 peer-reviewed articles, representing empirical data from 81 countries. Twenty main categories of CES and their subcategories delivered by agroecosystems are identified. Through the network analysis we demonstrate how CES are interrelated, with agricultural heritage as a connecting core. In a comprehensive map, we further identify which LUMC types have influence upon specific CES categories, and what are the causes, outcomes of, and responses to environmental conflicts that emerge from these processes. CES and agroecosystems cannot be seen separately from one another, as a reflection of secular or recently-created relationships people have with their environments. While these relationships are dynamic, LUMC may lead to their impairment or even loss, with ensuing impacts on biocultural diversity. The resulting environmental conflicts push most frequently for greater participation of actors involved in farming, socio-cultural revalorisation of farmland activities and the promotion of multi-functionality.","Agroecosystems and Cultural ecosystem services and Land-use management changes and Environmental conflicts and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and POLITICAL ECOLOGY and CLIMATE-CHANGE and LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT and TRADE-OFFS and AGRICULTURE and HERITAGE and BIODIVERSITY and VALUATION and FUTURE","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.016     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.016",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural","Summarised evidence"

Considering its scale and its contribution to forest management outcome, efficient management of selective logging is crucial to address challenges associated with timber demand, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Ongoing selective logging has been a key reason for forest degradation despite a set of recommended practices such as reduced-impact logging. With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders’ capacity. Our review suggests a broadening of the geographical and thematic focus of the study as well as a consideration of effective engagement and capacity development of the forest managers/owners and stakeholders in selective logging policies and practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation and Carbon sequestration and Forest degradation and Forest harvesting and Forest policy and Reduced- impact logging and Timber recovery and Biodiversity and Conservation and Developing Countries and Harvesting and Selective Cutting and Sustainable Forest Management and Tropics and Carbon and Logging (forestry) and Managers and Timber and Forest managers and Reduced-impact logging and Selective logging and Systematic Review and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and conservation and environmental degradation and environmental policy and evolution and forest management and pattern recognition and policy making and selective logging and stakeholder and sustainability and timber harvesting and tropical forest","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.006","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.006",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Although their benefits for pollinating insects have been frequently evaluated and reported, generalized conclusions about optimal settings for effective flower strips are still difficult. From the perspective of pollinators, flower strips vary distinctly in habitat quality, and the same applies for the control sites selected for scientific studies. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach based on a systematic review of recent studies (2009–2020) to analyze the relationship between flower strip effectiveness for pollinators and the contrast in habitat quality between flower strips and control sites. We extracted 350 data entries from 29 of 172 studies based on available data for richness or abundance of the pollinator taxa groups Apiformes, Lepidoptera and Syrphidae as response variables, for both flower strips and control treatments. All flower strips and control treatments were assigned a habitat quality score including information on spatial dimension, floral resources and management. Moreover, we included information on landscape complexity as measured by percent cover of seminatural habitats in the studied landscape. In general, our results of meta-analytical models showed an increasing effect size of flower strips on pollinators for higher contrasts in habitat quality between flower strips and control treatments. This relationship was consistent across pollinator taxa and different levels of landscape complexity. Altogether, in terms of pollinator habitat quality, high-quality flower strips were more attractive than low-quality flower strips, and the reported effectiveness of flower strips decreased from low-quality to high-quality control treatments. We recommend that results of future studies evaluating flower strips for pollinators are always linked with the contrast in habitat quality between selected flower strips and control treatments. © 2023 The Authors.

A systematic review","Environmental Evidence","Background: Altering the natural flow regime, an essential component of healthy fluvial systems, through hydropower operations has the potential to negatively impact freshwater fish populations. Establishing improved management of flow regimes requires better understanding of how fish respond to altered flow components, such as flow magnitude. Based on the results of a recent systematic map on the impacts of flow regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity, evidence clusters on fish abundance and biomass responses were identified for full systematic review. The primary goal of this systematic review is to address one of those evidence clusters, with the following research question: how do changes in flow magnitude due to hydropower operations affect fish abundance and biomass? Methods: This review follows the guidelines of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. It examined commercially published and grey literature originally identified during the systematic map process and a systematic search update. All articles were screened using an a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text) and consistency checks were performed at all stages. All eligible articles were assessed for study validity and specifically designed data extraction and study validity tools were used. A narrative synthesis included all available evidence and meta-analysis using the standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) was conducted where appropriate. Review findings: A total of 133 studies from 103 articles were included in this systematic review for data extraction and critical appraisal. Most studies were from North America (60%) and were conducted at 146 different hydropower dams/facilities. Meta-analysis included 268 datasets from 58 studies, separated into three analyses based on replication type [temporal (within or between year replication) or spatial]. Fish abundance (226 datasets) and biomass (30 datasets) had variable responses to changes in flow magnitude with estimated overall mean effect sizes ranging from positive to negative and varying by study design and taxa. In studies with temporal replication, we found a detectable effect of alterations to the direction of flow magnitude, the presence of other flow components, sampling methods, season, and fish life stage. However, we found no detectable effect of these moderators for studies with spatial replication. Taxonomic analyses indicated variable responses to changes in flow magnitude and a bias towards salmonid species. Conclusions: This synthesis did not find consistent patterns in fish abundance or biomass responses to alterations or changes in flow magnitude. Fish responses to flow magnitude alterations or changes were highly variable and context dependent. Our synthesis suggests that biotic responses may not be generalizable across systems impacted by hydroelectric power production and operations, where specific features of the system may be highly influential. Site-specific and adaptive management may be necessary. To improve study validity and interpretability, studies with long-term continuous monitoring, and both temporal and spatial replication are needed. When this gold standard is unfeasible, studies should strive, at minimum, to maximize replication within both intervention and comparator groups for either temporal or spatial designs. To further address knowledge gaps, studies are needed that focus on non-salmonids, multiple seasons, and systems outside of North America. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anthropogenic impacts and Dam and Discharge and Evidence synthesis and Fish density and Flow modification and Hydroelectric power","10.1186/s13750-021-00254-8","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00254-8",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

While the direct consequences of harvest on individual survival and population growth rate are often apparent, harvesting can also have indirect and more subtle demographic consequences. Disentangling these consequences, however, requires in-depth knowledge of individual life histories of both females and males in the population. Here, we summarise demographic research on a population where such data exist: the Vega moose population in northern Norway. In this population, vital rates vary considerably among both females and males, and harvesting increases this variation by generating positive covariation between reproductive performance and survival. The skewed age and sex structure, which is typical of many harvested populations, also has demographic consequences: it reduces the ratio of effective to total population size and influences variation in vital rates in males and females. The moose harvest at Vega is structured by age- and sex-specific quotas, but it is not intentionally selective regarding size or other phenotypic characteristics. Still, harvest selection for earlier birth rates and larger calves was apparent, likely due to habitat-performance relationships and habitat-specific harvest mortality. Together, the bulk of research on this population shows that harvesting impacts population demography through many different pathways, with some being more subtle than others. These complex pathways influence the demographic variance and affect stochastic processes such as population growth, genetic drift, and rates of evolutionary change, and they must therefore be acknowledged in management plans to achieve sustainable harvesting.",NA,"10.3354/cr01650","https://doi.org/10.3354/cr01650",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

Second, ten ecosystem services and three sub-services were assessed and characterized, with water and opportunities for recreation and tourism found to be of particular prominence to locals. Third, our results show that provisioning and habitat services have declined over the past fifty years, while carbon sequestration and storage has increased.

We reviewed the use of population traits for evaluating grassland restoration success based on 141 publications (1986-2015). The results demonstrated that population demography was relatively well-assessed but detailed studies providing information on key stages of the life cycle were lacking despite their importance in determining population viability. Vegetative and generative performances have been thoroughly investigated, notably the components of plant fitness, such as reproductive output, while genetic and spatial population structures were largely ignored.

Targeted species were principally common and dominant natives, or invasive plants while rare or threatened species were poorly considered.

By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning restores the structure of vertebrate communities. Location: Worldwide. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness, Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community structure. Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities. However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but positive effects in North America. Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment effects on vertebrates. Additionally, our findings provide an impetus for determining the mechanisms associated with changes in vertebrate diversity and abundance in shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes.","biodiversity and global change and grasslands and grazing and pastoral abandonment and savannas and shrub encroachment and shrub thinning and species richness and woody encroachment and LAND-USE and SPECIES RICHNESS and VEGETATION STRUCTURE and HABITAT STRUCTURE and ARID SAVANNA and RESPONSES and COMMUNITY and INVASION and DYNAMICS and PATTERNS","10.1111/geb.12675     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12675",NA,NA,NA,"Naturally open area under the tree-line","Summarised evidence"

A systematic review","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes. Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis. Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had ""control-impact"" design, only two studies used ""before-after-controlimpact"" design, and one study used ""before-after"" design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads. Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.","Coleoptera and Diversity and Green infrastructure and Hymenoptera and Intervention and Invertebrates and Lepidoptera and Movement and Right of way and Roadside and GROUND BEETLE COLEOPTERA and FORMICIDAE POPULATIONS and HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE and BUTTERFLY COMMUNITIES and SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION and SPECIES COMPOSITION and ANT HYMENOPTERA and ROADSIDE VERGES and LAND-USE and OF-WAY","10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3",NA,NA,NA,"Transport corridors","Summarised evidence"

Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists. © 2019 The Authors","Forest birds and Forest management and Forest specialists and Retention forestry and Selective harvest","10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00615","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00615",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"
"581","rayyan-674240276","Global meta-analysis reveals that invertebrate diversity is higher in permanent than in temporary lentic water bodies","Freshwater Biology","One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats, and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference, including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial dataset, which included 70% of the studies, revealed that diversity in PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts; e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where the frequency of drying events increases. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","dispersal and dry period and hydroperiod and resting stages and systematic review","10.1111/fwb.13409","https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13409",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

In the case of leakage, land-use change that would have occurred in the PA is displaced to an unprotected area where it would not have otherwise occurred. The resultant 'leakages' can offset benefits achieved inside PAs, confound impact assessments, and exacerbate the problems of opportunistic protection of lands. Conversely, in the case of 'blockage', the unprotected surroundings experience less land-use change than would have otherwise occurred due to a positive spillover effect from nearby protected areas. Little is known about the magnitude, ubiquity, and predictability of spillovers that have already occurred in the global PA network. Here we systematically review the literature and collate the existing evidence to quantify deforestation spillovers. We calculated deforestation rates within 3,398 PAs, most of which were found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, and in their unprotected adjacent surroundings and compared these rates to a baseline derived from the wider landscape. Of the 2,575 PAs that effectively restricted deforestation rates within their bounds relative to the baseline, 11.8% showed leakage and 54.8% exhibited blockage. Deforestation rates in the remaining 33.4% were indistinguishable from their respective baselines. Linear modelling of the correlates of leakage and blockage showed that PA-specific characteristics like size and IUCN category were uninformative, whereas national-scale socioeconomic factors like population density and GDP were useful predictors. Although spillovers from land-use restrictions are ultimately driven by socioeconomic factors, their ecological consequences are such that PA assessments should routinely and explicitly account for displaced impacts to the unprotected surroundings.

In the present article, we synthesize 307 studies in a systematic review of contemporary evolution following reduced connectivity and habitat alteration on freshwater fishes. Genetic diversity loss was more commonly observed for small populations impounded in small habitat patches for many generations behind low-passability barriers. Studies show that impoundments can cause rapid adaptive evolution in migration timing, behavior, life history, temperature tolerance, and morphology, as well as reduce phenotypic variance, which can alter adaptive potential and ecological roles. Fish passage structures can restore migratory populations but also create artificial selection pressures on body size and migration. The accelerating pace of dam removals and the paucity of data for fishes other than salmonids, other vertebrates, invertebrates, and tropical and southern hemisphere organisms highlights the urgent need for more studies on the rapid evolutionary effects of dams. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Here we present a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to identify the drivers of urban pollinator populations and pollination. A total of 141 studies were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed. Pollinator responses to urbanization were contrasting. We contend that positive responses were often associated with urban sprawl, i.e. moderate levels of urbanization of rural, mostly agricultural land below 50% impervious surface, whereas high levels of densification with high percentages of sealed and built-up area (above 50%), largely led to pollinator declines and loss of pollination services. Further, urbanization generally reduced pollinator diversity when compared to natural or semi-natural areas, but enhanced it when compared to intensified agricultural landscapes. In addition, pollinator responses were commonly highly trait- and scale-specific. Cavity nesters and generalist species usually profited more from urbanization than ground nesters and specialists. Overall, urban pollinator communities still seem to provide sufficient pollination services to wild vegetation and crops. Pollinator diversity generally increased with the amount of urban green spaces at the landscape scale, and locally with availability of nesting resources and flowering plants. Positive effects of floral additions were largely independent of the plant's origin, whether native or non-native. Only a few studies included landscape configuration. Likewise, abiotic urban drivers, e.g. heat island effects and air and light pollution, remain little studied. Tropical and developing regions, most heavily impacted by current and future urbanization, are strongly underrepresented. We conclude that biodiversity-friendly urbanization can make a valuable contribution to pollinator conservation, in particular in face of the continued intensification of rural agriculture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Pollination and Pollinators and Traits and Urban densification and Urban sprawl and Urbanization and Magnoliophyta and ecosystem service and generalist and landscape ecology and literature review and pollination and pollinator and species diversity and urban area and urban sprawl and urbanization","10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108321","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108321",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

The scientific evidence for potentially relevant and environmentally beneficial practices, however, is scattered among numerous sources. This article examines the state of knowledge regarding agri-environmental practices and their impact on various domains of the environment (climate change, soil, water and biodiversity). The selection was restricted to practices applicable to German farmers. Ninety-eight literature reviews and meta-analyses assessing the environmental impacts of agri-environmental practices in the German context were found in a systematic review of the academic literature from 2011 onwards. A total of 144 agricultural management practices were identified that contribute toward achieving certain environmental objectives. The practices were clustered in eight categories: (1) Fertilizer strategies, (2) Cultivation, (3) Planting: vegetation, landscape elements & other, (4) Grazing strategies, (5) Feeding strategies, (6) Stable management, (7) Other, (8) Combined practices & bundles. The findings of this study suggest that some general patterns can be observed regarding the environmental benefits of different practices. While it is possible to derive recommendations for specific practices in terms of individual environmental objectives, their relevance is likely to be context-dependent. Moreover, this study reveals that bundles of practices can have positive synergistic impacts on the environment. Notably, only few reviews and meta-analyses considered the implementation and opportunity costs of environmentally beneficial practices. Agri-environmental policies need to consider the broad range of practices that have been shown to impact the environment positively, including their costs, and provide context-specific incentives for farmers to adopt them. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agri-environmental practices and Agricultural land use and German agriculture and Literature review and Sustainability","10.1007/s10113-022-01892-5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-022-01892-5",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

Animals display different response strategies in urban environments compared to natural areas, but patterns may differ among species. To better comprehend this process, we focused on a limited number of species that are present in many urban green spaces around the globe. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate which response strategies chipmunks, arboreal and flying squirrels use to cope with urban environments, exploring whether there are general response patterns, and to reveal potential adaptations to life in urban areas. We included studies that compared trait differences among conspecifics living in different areas along an urbanisation gradient (rural–urban) and studies comparing individuals or populations between urban areas with different environmental characteristics. The effects of urbanisation on chipmunks, arboreal and flying squirrels, at the individual and at the population levels, were identified in nine topics. Included articles explored at least one of these topics and their key findings were described. Effects of urbanisation are evident in all considered topics. However, we found contrasting patterns between species or even among individuals of the same species studied in different geographical areas. Overall, we reported two knowledge gaps: some phenotypic traits were considered in few studies, and many species, especially those living in the Global South, where urban growth rate is higher, have not been studied. This systematic review suggests that urbanisation can be an important driver for adaptation in small mammals, underlining the complexity and differentiation of response patterns. Since target species have important ecological and social roles, additional comparative studies, increasing our understanding of processes that determine their presence in cities, are essential for urban green planning which aims to conserve biodiversity. © 2023 The Authors.

Some animals that persist in urban environments demonstrate behaviors distinct from their non-urban counterparts. These potential behavioral changes are the subject of a growing body of research in the areas of wildlife ecology, biology, and conservation. In spite of increasing urban wildlife research, studies focused specifically on changing behavior in urban mammals is limited. We conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize current research on behavior changes in wild urban mammals. We included 83 papers published between 1987 and March 2020. Omnivores were the leading subject of study, closely followed by carnivores and the specific behaviors most widely studied were home range and vigilance. Among the reviewed studies, there were 166 observations of 44 distinct behaviors with 155 occurrences of behavior change relative to conspecifics in non-urban areas. The most commonly studied and observed type of behavior change was alert behavior. Results indicate urban environments drive adaptive responses in behavior including changes in home range and diet preference, shifts in activity budget and vigilance, decreased flight initiation distance, and increased nocturnal activity. Some urban mammal species even demonstrated the ability to modulate behaviors based on environmental cues. Our results highlight the need for long-term wildlife behavior studies across a variety of urban settings to promote successful urban wildlife management and conservation. © Copyright © 2020 Ritzel and Gallo.","acclimatory response and adaptive response and behavioral syndrome and FID and home range and nocturnal activity and regulatory response and urban wildlife","10.3389/fevo.2020.576665","https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.576665",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: (1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and (2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats, so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970 and 2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers, respectively), habitat fragmentation (37 papers), and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%), and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways.

The effects of tree location on ecosystem service delivery have been emphasised. However, there is no integrated overview of the different aspects of tree location, here called spatial contextual factors, that mediate urban tree ecosystem services. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and provides a comprehensive overview of spatial contextual factors recognised by research as relevant for ecosystem service delivery by urban trees. To support creating such an overview, we first gain insight into the current common understanding of what spatial context is conceptually and how it participates in the co-production of ecosystem services. We find that generally, spatial context is represented by both social and ecological structures and processes and that it mediates ecosystem services by four mechanisms along the ecosystem service cascade. In the next step, we identify 114 unique spatial contextual factors mediating 31 ecosystem services of urban trees. Of all factors, people, represented by physical location, socio-demographics or building functions, mediate the highest number of services, highlighting the importance of urban planning and design in mediating urban tree ecosystem services. © 2021 The Author(s)","Contextual factors and Ecosystem services and Mediating mechanisms and Spatial context and Strategic tree planting and Urban trees","10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101296","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101296",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

We present a systematic review and narrative synthesis of 169 publications investigating how different forms of governance influence conservation outcomes, paying particular attention to the role played by Indigenous peoples and local communities. We find a stark contrast between the outcomes produced by externally controlled conservation, and those produced by locally controlled efforts. Crucially, most studies presenting positive outcomes for both well-being and conservation come from cases where Indigenous peoples and local communities play a central role, such as when they have substantial influence over decision making or when local institutions regulating tenure form a recognized part of governance. In contrast, when interventions are controlled by external organizations and involve strategies to change local practices and supersede customary institutions, they tend to result in relatively ineffective conservation at the same time as producing negative social outcomes. Our findings suggest that equitable conservation, which empowers and supports the environmental stewardship of Indigenous peoples and local communities represents the primary pathway to effective long-term conservation of biodiversity, particularly when upheld in wider law and policy. Whether for protected areas in biodiversity hotspots or restoration of highly modified ecosystems, whether involving highly traditional or diverse and dynamic local communities, conservation can become more effective through an increased focus on governance type and quality, and fostering solutions that reinforce the role, capacity, and rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities.

However, anthropogenic pressures have modified natural river landscapes, reducing their extent and causing severe limitations to the natural recruitment of riparian species. In particular, the recruitment of Salix species (willows) is highly dependent on fluvial processes. A comprehensive understanding of the drivers of Salix recruitment is crucial to effectively restore and conserve riparian biodiversity. To date however, there has been no systematic review of the drivers of Salix recruitment in riparian ecosystems. We provide a synthesis of Salix recruitment requirements from the scientific literature throughout the world. Our results show that the proportion of species studied compared to existing species is low worldwide, revealing a need for more research on Salix recruitment. We identified 19 abiotic factors concerning Salix recruitment, which we classified into four groups. The most studied abiotic factors are those related to soil (35%) and hydrology (25%). Within those categories, soil moisture and flow regime are the most frequently studied, while interstitial soil temperature, precipitation, geomorphologic dynamism, and atmospheric CO2 content are among the least studied factors. We identified 6 types of environmental pressures. Flow regulation followed by invasive vegetation competition are the most studied pressures, while the effects of climate change and extreme climatic events on willow recruitment have received little attention. Additionally, there has been little consideration of the interactions of multiple anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, we recommend comparative studies and experiments including several species to fill this knowledge gap. Our synthesis of the factors that influence Salix recruitment, such as optimal temperature ranges and elevations, can be incorporated into management practices to promote successful native riparian tree regeneration. Further research on how both abiotic factors and anthropogenic pressures affect Salix regeneration would greatly contribute to conservation of fluvial landscapes, and increase the success of restoration initiatives.","Salix and Ecosystem engineers and Recruitment and Establishment and River and Willow and RIPARIAN TREE ESTABLISHMENT and COLORADO RIVER and SEED-GERMINATION and CLIMATE-CHANGE and WISCONSIN RIVER and NATIVE TREES and TRADE-OFFS and WILLOW and VEGETATION and SURVIVAL","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107010","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107010",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

Yet, despite rapid development in this field over the past decade, the use of plant functional trait frameworks in the context of wetland restoration remains limited. Ambitious wetland restoration goals, and previous difficulties to meet them, underscore the need for continued refinement of science-backed restoration approaches for present and future conditions. Plant functional traits are one approach that deserves additional attention and scientific inquiry to inform restoration in wetlands. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (published 2000 to 2020) addressing plant functional traits in wetland restoration. Here, we summarize that body of literature and identify factors limiting the inclusion of plant functional trait frameworks in wetland restoration. We emphasize the need for consensus on terminology and trait selection in this field, provide definitive guidelines for moving this field forward for both researchers and practitioners, identify key plant functional traits to inform specific restoration goals, and highlight case studies exemplary of this approach in wetland restoration. A plant functional trait framework has the potential to inform and improve restoration of the world’s wetlands by making important linkages between traits, desired ecosystem functions, and restoration trajectories. However, the use of this approach requires further development and that both research and practice reach a consensus on which traits are most critical to measure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.","Plant functional traits and Plant height and Restoration and Seed mass and Specific leaf area and Trait-based framework and Wetlands and leaf area and plant community and restoration ecology and seed set and wetland","10.1007/s13157-023-01741-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-023-01741-z",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

Human population growth and associated changes in urbanization, transportation, and resource extraction all contribute to anthropogenic noise and are predicted to increase in the coming decades. Wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise is expected to rise correspondingly. Data collected through field research are uniquely important in advancing understanding of the real-world repercussions of human activity on wildlife. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of literature published from 2008 to 2018 that reported on field investigations of anthropogenic noise impacts. We evaluated publication metrics (e.g., publication rates and journal type), geographical distribution of studies, study subject, and methods used. Research activity increased markedly over the assessment period. However, there was a pronounced geographical bias in research, with most being conducted in North America or Europe, and a notable focus on terrestrial environments. Fewer than one-fifth of terrestrial studies were located in rural areas likely to experience urbanization by 2030, meaning data on ecosystems most likely to be affected by future changes are not being gathered. There was also bias in the taxonomic groups investigated. Most research was conducted on birds and aquatic mammals, whereas terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates received limited attention. Almost all terrestrial studies examined diurnal species, despite evidence that nocturnality is the prevailing animal activity pattern. Nearly half the studies investigated effects of road or urban noise; the bulk of research was restricted to functional, rather than physiological or demographic consequences. Few experimental studies addressed repercussions of long-term exposure to anthropogenic noise or long-term postexposure effects, and multiple noise types or levels were rarely compared. Tackling these knowledge gaps will be vital for successful management of the effects of increasing wildlife exposure to anthropogenic noise. © 2020 The Authors.

As forests are increasingly affected by global change, including climate change, more frequent and severe natural disturbances, and shifts in land use, open questions remain regarding the long-term and sustainable provision of this crucial protective service. To improve our understanding of the various effects of global change on protective forests, we summarized the current knowledge based on a systematic review. Focusing on changes in mountain forests’ protective effect against snow avalanches, landslides, rockfall, torrential floods and debris flow, we assessed 72 peer-reviewed, English publications. Overall, climate-induced changes are expected to increase forests’ protective effect at higher elevations but reduce it at lower elevations mainly due to increased drought. Natural disturbances usually decrease the protective effect of forests, and their impact is often further exacerbated by salvage logging. Different forest management strategies are often studied using forest simulation models, and their impacts on protective forests strongly depend on the local context and interactions with climate change. While clearcuts consistently reduce the protective effect, other forest management interventions such as thinning can have either positive or negative effects. Most of the reviewed studies were case studies based on forest simulation or process-based hazard models (but rarely combining the two), while empirical evidence was scarce. Forests’ protective effect is often assessed using (diverse) indicators of forest structure, but evaluations of resulting risks are less common. More consistent modeling approaches linking forest structure to hazard and risk, as well as consistent indicators across different case studies, are needed for a better understanding of changes in protective forests and the service they provide under global change.

We evaluate the drivers of wetland values in agricultural landscapes to increase the effectiveness and reliability of benefit transfer tools to assign values to local wetland services. We reviewed 668 studies that analyzed wetland ecosystem services within agricultural environments and identified 45 studies across 22 countries that provided sufficient economic information to be included in a quantitative meta-analysis. We developed meta-regression models to represent provisioning and regulating wetland ecosystem services and identify the main drivers of these ecosystem service categories. Provisioning wetland ecosystem service values were best explained (direction of effects in parenthesis) by high-income variable (+), peer-reviewed journal publications (+), agricultural total factor productivity index (−) and population density (+), while agricultural total factor productivity index (−), income level (+) and wetland area (−) had significant effects on regulating wetland ecosystem service values. Our models can help estimate wetland values more reliably across similar regions because they have significantly lower transfer errors (66 and 185% absolute percentage error for the provisioning and regulating models, respectively) than the errors from unit value transfers. Model predicted wetland values ($/Ha/Year) range from $0.62 to $11,216 for regulating services and $0.95 to $2,122 for provisioning services and vary based on the differences in the levels of the variables (in the wetland locations) that best explained the estimated models. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agricultural landscapes and Benefit transfer and Meta-regression and Provisioning ecosystem services and Regulating ecosystem services and Wetlands and agricultural land and ecosystem service and meta-analysis and population density and total factor productivity and wetland","10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

A global meta-analysis","AoB PLANTS","As primarily sessile organisms, plants often show a non-random spatial distribution of genotypes over distance. This process known as fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) has been suggested through systematic reviews to depend on life form, mating system, and pollen and seed dispersal vectors, while there is no consensus on its behaviour due to external factors, such as anthropogenic habitat changes. By conducting a systematic review and global meta-analysis of empirical FSGS studies, we aimed to evaluate how anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation influence the strength of FSGS in plant populations by means of the Sp statistic. Moreover, we tested how pollination and seed dispersal vectors contribute to the variation of the Sp statistic. We retrieved 243 FSGS studies from 1960 to 2020 of which only 65 were informative for the systematic review. Most empirical studies comprised outcrossers (84%) and trees (67%), with few herbs (23%) and scarce annual species (2%). In weighted meta-analyses for 116 plant populations (31 studies), we did not detect significant effects in the magnitude of effect sizes for the Sp statistic among undisturbed, degraded and fragmented habitats. Results showed significant effects for seed dispersal vectors, but not for pollination. Overall, we observed high variation among the effect sizes (not related to the goodness-of-fit of mixed models) of habitat status, pollination and seed dispersal categories, which precludes identifying biological trends on the Sp statistic. More empirical studies are needed that contrast multiple plant populations in disturbed versus undisturbed habitats, and by increasing the taxonomic groups, such as herbs and annual plants. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, their interaction with the hosting water body and implications for ecosystem function is poorly understood. Understanding potential impacts is critical as water bodies provide many ecosystem services on which humans rely and are integral for delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we used scientific evidence from a systematic review and stakeholder expertise, captured through an international survey and a workshop, alongside existing understanding of the role of water bodies in delivering ecosystem services and the SDGs. We found 22 evidence outcomes that indicated potential physical, chemical and biological impacts of FPV on water bodies. Assessment by stakeholders from across sectors indicated that reduced water evaporation is the greatest opportunity, whilst changes to water chemistry, including nitrification and deoxygenation, are the greatest threat. Despite these findings, FPV operators reported no observed water quality or ecosystem impacts. However, only 15% of respondents had performed water quality analysis; visual inspection alone cannot ascertain all water quality impacts. Based on the integration of these findings, we determined that FPV could impact nine ecosystem services. Furthermore, established linkages between ecosystem services and SDGs indicate the potential for impacts on eight SDGs, although whether the impact is positive or negative is likely to depend on FPV design and water body type. Our results further the understanding of the effects of FPVs on host water bodies and may help to ensure the anticipated growth in FPVs minimises threats and maximises opportunities, safeguarding overall sustainability. © 2021 The Authors","Ecosystem impact and Floating solar and Floatovoltaics and Knowledge system and Natural capital and Renewable energy and Sustainability and Water quality and Ecosystems and Solar concentrators and Solar power generation and Sustainable development and Ecosystem services and Evidence-based and Renewable energies and Solar photovoltaics and Waterbodies","10.1016/j.rser.2021.111639","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111639",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

In this study we focused on urban stressors that are ubiquitous to urban estuarine systems worldwide: elevated nutrients, toxic chemical contaminants, built infrastructure and non-indigenous species (NIS). We investigated structural (abundance, diversity and species richness) and functional endpoints (productivity, primary production (chlorophyll-a) and metabolism) commonly used to determine responses to these selected stressors. Through a systematic review of global literature, we found 579 studies of our selected stressors; 93% measured responses to a single stressor, with few assessing the effects of multiple stressors (7%). Structural endpoints were commonly used to measure the effects of stressors (49% of the total 579 studies). Whereas, functional endpoints were rarely assessed alone (10%) but rather in combination with structural endpoints (41%). Elevated nutrients followed by NIS were the most studied single stressors (43% and 16% of the 541 single stressor studies), while elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants were overwhelmingly the most common stressor combination (79% of the 38 multiple stressor studies); with NIS and built infrastructure representing major gaps in multi-stressor research. In the meta-analysis, structural endpoints tended to decrease, while functional endpoints increased and/or decreased in response to different types of organisms or groups. We predicted an antagonistic effect of elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants based on the opposing enriching versus toxic effects of this stressor combination. Of note, biodiversity was the only endpoint that revealed such an antagonistic response. Our results highlight the continuing paucity of multiple stressor studies and provide evidence for opposing patterns in the responses to single and interacting stressors depending on the measured endpoint.

A systematic review was carried out using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guideline to compile and synthesize available literature on the influence of habitat alteration on the structure of helminth communities in small mammals. The aim of this review was to describe the variation in infection rates of helminth species associated with habitat alteration and to discuss the theoretical framework that may explain such changes in relation to parasite, host, and environmental features. Twenty-three scientific articles published between 2005 and 2022 were reviewed, 22 of which investigated parasite prevalence, 10 parasite burden, and 14 parasite richness in both altered and natural habitats. Information in assessed articles suggests that the structure of helminth communities in small mammals can be impacted by anthropogenic habitat alteration in various ways. Infection rates of monoxenous and heteroxenous helminths may increase or decrease in small mammals depending on whether their hosts (definitive and intermediate) are available, and environmental and host conditions modify the survival and transmission of parasitic forms. Also, given that habitat alteration may favor inter-species contacts, transmission rates of low host-specific helminths could be increased due to exposure to new reservoir hosts. In a continually changing world, it is essential to assess the spatio-temporal variations of helminth communities in wildlife inhabiting altered and natural habitats to determine potential impacts on wildlife conservation and public health. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Degradation and Environment and Fragmentation and Metazoan and Parasite and Wildlife and Animals and Animals, Wild and Ecosystem and Helminthiasis, Animal and Helminths and Mammals and Parasites and Acanthocephala and Alouatta and Alouatta palliata aequatorialis and autopsy and bandicoot and cestode and classification and coinfection and conceptual framework and Controrchis and data extraction and data synthesis and Didelphimorphia and environmental factor and explanatory variable and feces culture and forest and geographic distribution and habitat and helminth and helminthiasis and host parasite interaction and host range and infection rate and information retrieval and Medline and microbial community and microbial diversity and nematode and nonhuman and parasite diversity and parasite load and parasite prevalence and parasite transmission and Primata linnaeus and public health and publication and Review and Rhabditida and rodent and search engine and small mammal and species richness and Strongylida and Strongyloides and trematode and Trichuris and vegetation and wildlife conservation and animal and animal parasitosis and ecosystem and mammal and meta analysis and parasite and parasitology and wild animal","10.1007/s00436-023-07804-8","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-023-07804-8",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

However, this claim is largely unevidenced as few studies of fully integrated regenerative systems are currently available. As a first step to addressing this knowledge gap, we here examine three practices now being promoted as part of RA: reducing tillage intensity, cover cropping and including a grass-based phase in arable rotations (ley-arable rotations). Our Bayesian meta-analysis of 195 paired SOC and crop yield observations from a systematic review of published studies finds statistically significant increases in SOC concentration for reduced tillage intensity (0.06 g C · 100 g−1) and ley-arable rotations (0.05 g C · 100−1 g yr−1 of ley) compared to conventional practice over an average study duration of 15 years, but no effect of cover crops. None of these practices reduce yield during cropping years, although we find no evidence of a win-win between increasing SOC and enhanced agricultural productivity following adoption. Future work should also evaluate the net greenhouse gas emission implications of each practice and potential for synergistic effects if RA practices are adopted in combination. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the RA practices investigated here can be promoted by land managers and policy makers without crop yield losses. © 2022 The Author(s).

Despite the numerous studies conducted on the management of invasive alien plants (MIAPs), limited reviews are available on how to restore the lost diversity of native communities after the control of invasive alien plants. Here, through a systematic review we synthesize recent developments related to the restoration of native plant communities after MIAP and provide a checklist to make decisions for addressing various outstanding questions based on different contexts. We address (1) how the restoration of biodiversity after the MIAP could be improved by controlling reinvasion and novel invaders, and (2) what kind of follow up restoration methods should be employed to increase the diversity and functioning of native communities. Further, we briefly describe the importance of managing multitrophic interactions for reestablishing self-sustainable native plant communities after restoration. This review will guide researchers and restoration practitioners on how to move beyond the MIAP to conduct more research, and what actions to take for restoring the diversity of native communities on temporal and spatial scales. Based on the review of the state of knowledge, we offer the following practical implications: (1) given the investment of resources to curb invasive alien plants, active restoration efforts post invasion control are critical for effective recovery of biodiversity, regardless of the type of control method employed; (2) reducing the abundance of invasive seedbank, a robust legacy of invasion, and managing the arrival of new invasive seeds from the surroundings are crucial before the sowing or planting of native species; and (3) aiming to restore the desired diversity of native plant communities requires a thorough understanding of the conditions and level of assisted active restoration to implement the different practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Active restoration and Biodiversity conservation and Invasion prevention and Native plant recovery and Revegetation and Seedbank legacy and Biodiversity and Investments and Soil conservation and Alien plants and Ecological restoration and Native plants and Plant communities and Seedbanks and biodiversity and biological invasion and introduced species and relative abundance and restoration ecology and seed bank and sowing and Restoration","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107122","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107122",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Agroforestry is widely promoted as an intervention to address these issues. While some benefits of integrating trees on farms, such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity, are reasonably well known, less is known about other potential benefits, such as on-farm production. Understanding and quantifying these benefits would inform farm planning and decision-making. We used a systematic review approach to analyse the evidence base for biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems (including shelterbelts, riparian plantings, plantations, pasture trees, silvopasture and remnant native vegetation) provided to grazed dairy enterprises. We identified 83 publications containing 123 records that fit our review criteria of reporting on biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems on dairy farms relative to a grazed pasture comparison. For each relationship between a woody system and ecosystem service, we assessed the level of support, strength and predominant direction of evidence, and summarised the causal relationships (woody system ≫ mechanism ≫ outcome). Shelterbelts and riparian plantings were the most commonly reported woody systems. Linkages between woody systems and ecosystem services were largely positive, with the types of services provided and their importance differing among systems. Mean evaluation scores for the strength of the evidence were moderate to strong. However, the number of records for each relationship was often low. Consequently, only eight of the 30 causal pathways identified had high confidence; a further 14 had medium confidence indicating that these have good potential to deliver benefits but warrant further work. Although the evidence here was largely qualitative, our results provide strong support for the internal benefits that natural capital assets, such as on-farm woody systems, can provide to the productivity and resilience of grazed dairy enterprises. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry and Dairy farming and Ecosystem service and Reforestation and Shelterbelt and Silvopasture and Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration and Climate Change and Conservation of Natural Resources and Dairying and Ecosystem and Farms and Trees and Decision making and Ecosystem services and agroforestry and dairy farming and ecosystem service and grazing and reforestation and shelterbelt and agricultural land and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and dairying and decision making and ecosystem and human and outcome assessment and pasture and plantation and productivity and review and systematic review and vegetation and climate change and environmental protection and procedures and tree and Ecosystems","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135345","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135345",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural","Summarised evidence"

As such, there is a need to evaluate indicator taxa that may be used to monitor the health of agricultural management systems. Carabid beetles are ubiquitous and functionally crucial in agroecosystems while at the same time are sensitive to the changes caused by management practices. Their quick response to anthropogenic disturbances has been proposed as a practical and realistic tool for monitoring the sustainability of agricultural practices. However, there is still disagreement about carabids as possible indicators of agroecosystem sustainability. We conducted a systematic review of the responses of carabid beetles to agricultural systems in different biogeographical areas. We examined whether these beetles could serve as potential indicators of agroecosystem sustainability. The ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus were used to search for papers published from 2000–2019. In total, we included 69 studies indicating the use of carabids to monitor the impact of management practices in agroecosystems. Most studies were conducted in European countries (n = 37), while Southern Africa and East Asia countries were significantly under-represented (n = 10). Carabid beetle response to agroecosystems varied between management practices, with biodiversity indices (n = 41: positive 60%, negative 19%, and neutral 19%) being the most measured response variable, followed by functional diversity (n = 28: positive 67%, negative 25%, and neutral 7%). Overall, our findings highlight the need for more research in underdeveloped countries, to investigate the potential of overlooked carabids and include response variables measuring functional diversity in assessing the sustainability of agricultural management.

Sealing, compaction by trampling and pollution destroy and degrade city soils and potentially damage soil-living invertebrates. The existing literature on how urbanization affects soil invertebrates is inconsistent, presenting both negative and positive effects. Therefore, here we aimed to synthesize the effects of urbanization on soil invertebrates considering their taxonomic (Acari, Annelida, Carabidae, Collembola, Gastropoda, Isopoda, Myriapoda, Nematoda) and functional (soil living vs. soil-related; mobility) identities, as well as to examine how the overall effect is modulated by climatic conditions (total annual precipitation, annual mean ambient temperature), urban heat island effect (based on ambient temperature differences between urban and rural areas) and city population. In a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses, we extracted 158 effect sizes from 75 studies on abundance and 125 effect sizes from84 studies on species richness. Invertebrate abundance showed an increase (r= 0.085), whereas species richness significantly decreased with increasing urbanization (r=-0.168). The reason behind this could be that a few generalist species can adapt well to the urban environment and achieve strongly elevated densities. The species richness of annelids (r = -0.301), springtails (r = -0.579), and snails (r=-0.233) decreased with advancing urbanization, most probably because these animals are sensitive to soil compaction and pollution, both of which are common consequences of urbanization. The temperature did not modify the effects of urbanization, but precipitation modified the effects on abundance (r=-0.457). Abundance increased with advancing urbanization in drier climates, probably because irrigation increased soil moisture, whereas it decreased in wet climates, as urban areas were drier than their surroundings. Making future citiesmore climate-neutral could better sustain soil biodiversity.","Carabid and Heat island effect and Irrigation and Mobility and Precipitation and Temperature and COMMUNITY STRUCTURE and ISOPOD ASSEMBLAGES and CARABID BEETLES and HOT-SPOT and SOIL and BIODIVERSITY and IMPACTS and MANAGEMENT and DIVERSITY and DIPLOPODA","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160145","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160145",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

To inform decision-making, it is essential to understand the pathways of impacts of particular human activities, especially those that affect species such as salmon, which have high ecological, social-cultural and economic values. Salmon systems provide an opportunity to build from the substantial body of research on responses to estuary developments and take stock of what is known. We conducted a systematic English-language literature review on the responses of juvenile salmon to anthropogenic activities in estuaries and nearshore areas asking: what has been studied, where are the major knowledge gaps and how do stressors affect salmon? We found a substantial body of research (n = 167 studies; 1,369 comparative tests) to help understand responses of juvenile salmon to 24 activities and their 14 stressors. Across studies, 82% of the research was conducted in the eastern Pacific (Oregon and Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada) showing a limited geographical scope. Using a semiquantitative approach to summarize the literature, including a weight-of-evidence metric, we found a range of results from low to moderate–high confidence in the consequences of the stressors. For example, we found moderate–high confidence in the negative impacts of pollutants and sea lice and moderate confidence in negative impacts from connectivity loss and changes in flow. Our results suggest that overall, multiple anthropogenic activities cause negative impacts across ecological scales. However, our results also reveal knowledge gaps resulting from minimal research on particular species (e.g. sockeye salmon), regions (e.g. Atlantic) or stressors (e.g. entrainment) that would be expedient areas for future research.

Existing empirical research has suggested that agroforestry—the integration of trees with crops and/or livestock—can prevent environmental degradation, improve agricultural productivity, increase carbon sequestration, and support healthy soil and healthy ecosystems while providing stable incomes and other benefits to human welfare. However, the extent of the literature supporting or refuting these claims has not been well documented. This study addresses this research gap by collating and describing the evidence for the impacts of agroforestry on ecosystem services and human well-being in high-income countries and presents the characteristics and gaps in the literature. Methods: We searched 5 primary databases and 24 organizational websites using a pre-defined search string designed to capture articles relating agroforestry practices and policy interventions to outcomes in high-income countries. Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature published in the English language between January 1990 and June 2020. We screened the identified articles for inclusion or exclusion in two stages: title/abstract and full text. We extracted data from articles included at the full-text stage to form the map and associated database. For inclusion, the study in question must have assessed the impacts of the deliberate promotion and/or actual integration of woody perennials (trees, shrubs, etc.) with agricultural crops and/or animals. Results: Our search returned 31,852 articles of which we included 585 primary articles, 6 ongoing primary articles, and 41 systematically conducted literature reviews. The articles spanned three decades and 31 countries. The most studied practices are on linear boundary plantings (hedgerows, shelterbelts, windbreaks, and riparian buffers) and silvopasture systems. The most studied outcome is regulation and maintenance of physical, chemical, and biological conditions as an ecosystem service, followed by agricultural yield and mediation of waste/toxics/other nuisances (nutrient runoff and carbon storage). Conclusions: Results highlight key evidence gaps and areas where research has concentrated. Knowledge on the impacts of specific policy interventions to promote agroforestry remains scarce. The impacts of actual agroforestry practices are more well-studied, but the kinds of practices studied are limited, with most research focusing on two-component systems consisting of a simple tree configuration with one crop or livestock species, such as shelterbelts, windbreaks, and hedgerows, riparian buffers, and scattered trees on farms with crops and/or livestock. Regulating ecosystem services outcomes are by far the most studied, followed by agricultural productivity (an aspect of provisioning ecosystem services), while evidence on human well-being remains limited. We also found geographic biases, with little to no evidence for many countries. These biases suggest the strong need for further research to build the evidence base on agroforestry across high-income countries. The results can inform future research and policy decisions by making the evidence easily accessible and highlighting knowledge gaps as well as areas with enough evidence to conduct further systematic review. © 2022, The Author(s).",NA,"10.1186/s13750-022-00260-4","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-022-00260-4",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Here, we present a systematic review of current research integrating several areas of urban ecology to evaluate how plants are responding to urbanization. We found that most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The most represented biome was that of Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The majority of studies reported negative consequences of urbanization. The Urban Drivers most commonly cited as responsible for changes in plant species and communities were Land Cover Change and Biotic Invasion. In general, urbanization reduces the richness of plant species and pollinators' availability. It also homogenizes the environment, promotes the invasion of non-native species, causes changes in phenological events, and presents difficulties for plant growth. However, some species show evidence of adaptation to these adversities through their phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of traits that make individuals resilient to the urban environment. Although it has been established that urbanization imposes novel selective pressures resulting in unique adaptations to city life, patterns of changes in biodiversity in response to urbanization can vary by region, biomes, city history, and the taxa studied. The Urban Drivers responsible for floristic responses work simultaneously by modifying the environment. Therefore, it is challenging to predict response patterns of plants under urban growth. It is necessary to outline strategies for continuous monitoring to document the progress of species in perpetuating themselves in the face of urbanization. © 2022 The Authors","Adaptation and Biodiversity Loss and Urban Drivers and Urban Ecology","10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02243","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02243",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Rove beetles (Staphylinidae) are megadiverse and a key component in ecosystem functioning as generalist predators in forest habitats and agroecosystems. These beetles are sensitive to environmental changes related to the modification of natural habitats, however there is still no consensus on their usefulness as potential ecological disturbance indicators. Through an exhaustive literature review and a global quantitative analysis, we evaluated the response of rove beetles to land use change in different biogeographic regions to see if these beetles can be used as an ecological disturbance indicator. Using Hill's series (qD), species density and the density of individuals, rove beetle response was evaluated for different types of land use ranging from native habitats to crops and urban zones. Rove beetle density and richness respond negatively to crops and pastures, but urban zones were as diverse as some native habitats. The magnitude of the response varied among biogeographic regions and appears to be related to the life history traits of the species that make up the beetle communities. The high degree of variation observed in the response of rove beetles might result from the lack of information about the influence of the landscape's characteristics on local response. The idea that the simplification of native habitats leads to a reduction in rove beetle density and diversity is partially supported. However, in order to generalize a pattern of rove beetle response to the global scale, it is necessary to standardize the protocol for comparative studies in addition to considering other community attributes (e.g. species composition). The use of Staphylinidae as a potential ecological disturbance indicator in human-dominated landscapes is widely discussed. © 2020 The Authors","Biogeographic region and Ecological indicator groups and Hill's series and Response to human activities and Staphylinidae and Taxonomic bias and Coleoptera and Hexapoda and Indicator indicator and Crops and Forestry and Land use and Biogeographic regions and Comparative studies and Ecological disturbance and Ecosystem functioning and Environmental change and Generalist predators and Life-history traits and Species composition and beetle and generalist and land use change and literature review and meta-analysis and population density and population dynamics and species diversity and Ecosystems","10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107239","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107239",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Nowadays, these resources and the knowledge around their use are experiencing a process of erosion. This article aims to identify the factors explaining the abandonment or, on the other hand, the preservation of foraging practices in Europe. The second aim is to analyze how these practices contribute to the economic and social development of local communities and to the sustainability of land management. A systematic review of the literature on European foraging practices was performed to answer these research questions. Following this approach, 111 publications were selected and analyzed. The results highlight that the reasons for the abandonment of foraging practices are related to socio-economic changes as well as changes in the environment such as reduced availability and land-use change. On the other hand, heritagization processes of these resources, such as wild plants sold as traditional local products, in restaurants, or as eco-tourism experiences, are emerging. The sustainability of these practices has not been widely evaluated in the literature. Efficient management strategies of wild food resources could help foster all three dimensions of sustainability at the local level, as well as help preserve traditional knowledge. This systematic review thus contributes to highlighting the framework in which the sustainability of these practices should be assessed. © 2023 by the authors.","ethnobotany and food heritage and foraging and wild food and wild herbs and wild plants","10.3390/land12071299","https://doi.org/10.3390/land12071299",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

As the demand, use, and promotion of light-duty ORVs like all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), motorcycles, four-wheel drive trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) increases in remote wilderness, the landscape is becoming fragmented into disorganized and destructive networks of trails and roads. Substantial ecological impacts to a wide range of ecosystem structures and functions will likely result from ORV activity. Applying a global systematic review, we examine 105 publications about plant, soil, and wildlife responses to ORV traffic in different habitats to help guide the direction of future research, monitoring programs, and mitigation efforts. Most studies investigated impacts to animals, followed by soils, then vegetative responses. Soil studies primarily focused on physical impacts to the soil (i.e., compaction, erosion, rut depth), but some studies suggest that soil chemical and biological properties may also be impacted by ORV traffic. The literature on plant responses to ORV activities primarily explored vegetation loss, although impacts on the plant community were also investigated. Animal studies investigated impacts of ORV use on invertebrates, mammals, birds, and to a lesser extent reptiles/amphibians, including population-level, community-level, and behavioral responses. Overall, research on environmental impacts of ORV traffic is biased to coastal and desert ecosystems in the northern hemisphere (primarily in the US), often does not address mechanisms that may produce ecological impacts (e.g., intensity of vehicular disturbance and ecosystem- or species-specific sensitivity to ORV activities), and frequently focused on short-term responses. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms that cause the different responses of soil, plant, and animals to ORVs over the long-term in a broad range of ecosystems to support real-time management and conservation efforts.","amphibians and birds and invertebrates and mammals and motorized recreation and off-highway vehicle (OHV) and reptiles and plant diversity and LIZARD PHRYNOSOMA-MCALLII and SANDY BEACHES and GHOST CRABS and AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHERS and HIGHWAY VEHICLES and ALGODONES DUNES and SEDIMENT PRODUCTION and NATIONAL SEASHORE and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and HUMAN RECREATION","10.3389/fevo.2021.805707     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.805707",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Summarised evidence"

Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify to what extent recreational boat traffic and infrastructure for mooring affect the abundance of submerged vegetation on soft bottoms. Our systematic search yielded 25 studies containing data on effects of boat traffic, docks and mooring buoys on vegetation abundance. The abundance below docks was on average 18% of that in controls, and areas with boat traffic had on average 42% of the abundance in control areas. Mooring buoys often created scour areas without vegetation. However, the effects were variable and there were too few studies to test the reasons for this variability. We conclude that boating can cause significant declines in submerged vegetation but that informed management of boat traffic and improved design of docks and buoys can reduce negative impacts. © 2019, The Author(s).","Boat traffic and Docks and Macrophytes and Marinas and Mooring buoys and Seagrass and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Recreation and Ships and boating and meta-analysis and mooring system and scour and seagrass and tourism and ecosystem and environmental protection and meta analysis and recreation and ship","10.1007/s13280-019-01215-9","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01215-9",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

One manifestation of EIA proposed worldwide is agroecological farming, which will affect future landscapes, biodiversity and make assurance of crop yields more reliant on management of natural pest control. Using a systematic review we examined available knowledge to forecast the consequences for natural pest control of a landscape-scale transition to agroecological farming. A large body of information showed that prevailing agroecological practices can enhance natural pest control at the field level. This was, however, highly context specific (organisms, crop types or regions) and often modulated by landscape complexity, albeit in an inconsistent way. Consequently, our generic understanding of the functional responses of natural pest control to agroecological management remains limited. Furthermore, the consequences of a landscape-scale expansion of agroecological farming for natural pest control was hardly documented, with results suggesting limited effects. Available modelling tools and approaches to forecast natural pest control were diverse and promising, but the integration of accurate descriptions of farming practices at the landscape scale remains a challenge.

In these highly populated areas, multiple actors, interests, and activities coexist, leading to intensified conflicts between stakeholders. The research presented here aims to understand how coastal social-ecological complexity is studied within coastal ES literature. A systematic review of the literature consisting of 199 manuscripts was performed using the PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The results show that coastal ES research has been focused on understanding ecological processes for ES provision and value. Hence, coastal ES studies fall short of considering the social components and social-ecological interactions of coastal systems: ES flows, demand, coproduction, power relations, institutions and governance, temporal and spatial scales, value pluralism, uncertainty, and human well-being multidimensions and distribution. The partial integration of social-ecological complexity within coastal ES research limits coastal ES management because nonlinear interactions among social and ecological components are not well understood, particularly stakeholders’ relations, their roles, and the links to ES. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates the gaps identified during the review. The framework places coproduction and power relations as the core factors of assessments of coastal ES, as means to understand complex, nonlinear social-ecological interactions and feedback processes. Hence, it also provides necessary tools to address normative issues of coastal management such as control, access, trade-offs, and benefits. © 2019 by the author(s).","Coastal ecosystem services and Coastal social-ecological complexity and Coproduction and Human well-being and Power and Systematic literature review and coastal zone management and ecological approach and ecosystem service and environmental economics and literature review and power relations and stakeholder","10.5751/ES-10883-240224","https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10883-240224",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal","Summarised evidence"

Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies globally, comprised mostly of C3 grass species in the U.S., including 24 chronosequence studies that evaluated carbon changes over 75 years or longer. We showed that turfgrass established within the last ten years had a positive mean soil C sequestration rate of 5.3 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 (95% CI = 3.7–6.2), which is higher than rates reported for several soil conservation practices. Areas converted to turfgrass from forests were an exception, sometimes lost soil carbon, and had a cross-study mean sequestration rate that did not differ from 0. In some locations, soil C accumulated linearly with turfgrass age over several decades, but the major trend was for soil C accumulation rates to decline through time, reaching a cross-study mean sequestration rate that was not different from 0 at 50 years. We show that fitting soil C timeseries with a mechanistically derived function rather than purely empirical functions did not alter these conclusions, nor did employing equivalent soil mass versus fixed-depth carbon stock accounting. We conducted a partial greenhouse gas budget that estimated emissions from mowing, N-fertilizer production, and soil N2O emissions. When N fertilizer was applied, average maintenance emissions offset 32% of C sequestration in recently established turfgrass. Potential emission removals by turfgrass can be maximized with reduced-input management. Management decisions that avoid losing accrued soil C—both when turfgrass is first established and when it is eventually replaced with other land-uses—will also help maximize turfgrass C sequestration potential. © 2022","Carbon sequestration and Chronosequence and Greenhouse gases and Lawns and meta-analysis and Urbanization and Carbon and Carbon Sequestration and Soil and United States and Budget control and Fertilizers and Forestry and Gas emissions and Land use and Soil conservation and carbon and carbon dioxide and fertilizer and magnesium and nitrous oxide and C sequestration and Chronosequences and Greenhouses gas and Lawn and Meta-analysis and N fertilizers and Soil carbon sequestration and Turfgrass and carbon sequestration and chronosequence and grass and greenhouse gas and soil carbon and urbanization and Article and budget and carbon emission and controlled study and environmental impact and fertilizer application and forest and land use and nitrous oxide emission and nonhuman and soil and turfgrass and meta analysis and Soils","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159974","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159974",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

The stored carbon is called blue carbon. To date, studies relating strategy to enhance blue carbon storage is emerging. In developing a strategy to be applied to a natural resource, it is necessary to consider how it is affected and influences its people's lives. Meanwhile, the studies related to blue carbon management's social aspects are lacking compared to technical and policy aspects. This paper aims to identify peer-reviewed documents that discuss social aspects in the context of blue carbon management. This study uses a semi-systematic review approach by reviewing relevant documents based on determined keyword search terms. This study suggests that livelihood, land tenure, local knowledge, and local capacity are essential to incorporate in blue carbon management. The strategy must enforce communities to hold a significant role in governance. Those aspects would help to increase community engagement to manage and support blue carbon management. However, more extensive practical studies are needed to apply strategies on the real subject to strengthen the theory in recent literature. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals. © 2020 The Authors.

This represents an enormous potential loss of biodiversity and cost to human societies due to the economic benefits that birds provide through ecosystem services and ecotourism. Conservation of migratory bird species presents many unique challenges, as these birds rely on multiple geographically distinct habitats, including breeding grounds, non-breeding grounds, and stopover sites during migration. In particular, stopover habitats are seldom studied relative to breeding and non-breeding habitats, despite their importance as refueling stations for migratory birds. In this study, we summarize the current research on the use of temporary primary crops by birds during migration and we assess the species characteristics and agricultural practices most often associated with the use of cropland as stopover habitat. First, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the effects various farming practices and crop types have on the abundance and diversity of migratory birds using agricultural areas for stopovers. Second, we analyzed the ecological correlates of bird species in the Northern Hemisphere that predict which species may use these areas while migrating. We ran a GLMM to test whether primary diet, diet breadth, primary habitat, habitat breadth, or realm predicted stopover use of agricultural areas. Our review suggests that particular crop types (principally rice, corn, and sunflower), as well as farming practices that result in higher non-cultivated plant diversity, encourage the use of agricultural areas by migrating birds. We found that cropland is used as stopover habitat by bird species that can utilize a large breadth of habitats, as well as species with preferences for habitat similar in structure to agricultural areas. © Copyright © 2021 Blount, Horns, Kittelberger, Neate-Clegg and Şekercioğlu.","conservation ecology and crop science and diet and habitat and land use and landscape ecology and nearctic and palearctic","10.3389/fevo.2021.650641","https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.650641",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Desert","Summarised evidence"

A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to under informed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of ES scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported.

It is crucial for climate change mitigation, but it also accelerates the degradation of biodiversity through habitat loss and the displacement of wildlife. To understand the extent of displacement and reasons for observations where no displacement is reported, we conducted a systematic review of birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals. Eighty-four peer-reviewed studies of onshore wind power yielded 160 distinct displacement distances, termed cases. For birds, bats, and mammals, 63 %, 72 %, and 67 % of cases respectively reported displacement. Cranes (3/3 cases), owls (2/2), and semi-domestic reindeer (6/6) showed consistent displacement on average up to 5 km. Gallinaceus birds showed displacement on average up to 5 km, but in 7/18 cases reported to show “no displacement”. Bats were displaced on average up to 1 km in 21/29 cases. Waterfowl (6/7 cases), raptors (24/30), passerines (16/32) and waders (8/19) were displaced on average up to 500 m. Observations of no displacement were suggested to result from methodological deficiencies, species-specific characteristics, and habitat conditions favorable for certain species after wind power development. Displacement-induced population decline could be mitigated by situating wind power in low-quality habitats, minimizing the small-scale habitat loss and collisions, and creating high-quality habitats to compensate for habitat loss. This review provides information on distance thresholds that can be employed in the design of future wind energy projects. However, most studies assessed the effects of turbine towers of <100 m high, while considerably larger turbines are being built today. © 2023","Avoidance and Biodiversity and Land use and Mitigation and Renewable energy and alternative energy and biodiversity and climate change and habitat loss and population decline and turbine and wind power","10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110382","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110382",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal, Mountains","Summarised evidence"

A comprehensive overview of agricultural land abandonment provides an understanding of how the issue is emerging globally, the impacts it has caused and pathways that could halt the negative impacts. This study reviews the drivers and consequences of agricultural land abandonment and pathways for the reutilisation of abandoned agricultural lands. The 124 relevant articles used in this review were retrieved systematically from CAB Abstracts, Scopus and Web of Science, applying exclusion and inclusion criteria in line with standard protocols. The spatial and temporal diversity of the selected articles indicates that the majority of studies were conducted in European (64 articles) and Asian countries (44 articles). Although farmland abandonment has received research attention from the early 1990s, about 95% of the articles were published only in the last 15 years. In the case of Asian countries, almost all of the studies took place after 2014. Broadly, seven categories of drivers (demographic, household characteristics, farm characteristics, biophysical, economic, regulatory and socio-political) were responsible for agricultural land abandonment. This study found that land abandonment has both positive and negative consequences on several abiotic and biotic components of the landscape. However, negative consequences were most frequently reported compared to positive consequences, especially for agrobiodiversity and rural household livelihoods and communities. Positive impacts included enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. Few studies have discussed possible pathways for reutilisation of abandoned farmland. Productive reutilisation options included various farm-forest and afforestation systems, communal land management and high-value crop production. Research gaps included a framework for defining and measuring abandonment; multidisciplinary analyses of drivers and consequences; intrinsic (behavioural, cultural and geopolitical) factors affecting abandonment; and building capacity for alternative local land use options. This review provides a valuable starting point for rural development stakeholders to identify where future research is required and provides knowledge about the trade-offs and opportunities associated with land abandonment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Abandoned land and Determinants and Farmland abandonment and Land reutilisation and Land use change and Literature review","10.1016/j.envdev.2021.100681","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2021.100681",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

However, the area covered by this open ecosystem is decreasing worldwide, due to several threats like land use change or climate change. Ground-dwelling arthropods are an important group of the community of grassland soil invertebrates, and they play a key role within this ecosystem, while at the same time being sensitive to the changes caused by management practices like grazing, mowing, prescribed fire, etc. Using the Web of Science database, we conducted a systematic review to identify which groups of arthropods are being used as indicators to evaluate the ecological condition of grasslands in temperate regions, and which indices are being measured. As grasslands have been traditionally managed by humans for centuries, their ecological condition is intrinsically linked to the development of different management practices like grazing, mowing or restoration strategies, which usually affect soil and vegetation structure. We found that macro-arthropods were used in a greater number of studies than micro-arthropods (91% vs 15%), and within that size group, beetles were the preferred indicator in most of the temperate grassland types (49% of the studies), followed by spiders and ants. Few studies used grasshoppers to monitor grasslands changes. The indices more frequently assessed were species richness and abundance, and we identified that the response to the different management practices was quite heterogeneous. Restoration and grazing effects were the two factors more frequently evaluated for macro-arthropods, while micro-arthropods (Acari and Collembola) were dominant to assess land use type.

"622","rayyan-674239318","Can linear transportation infrastructure verges constitute a habitat and/or a corridor for vertebrates in temperate ecosystems? A systematic review","Environmental Evidence","Background: Linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, powerlines and waterways) generate well documented fragmenting effects on species habitats. However, the potential of verges of linear transportation infrastructures (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of constant loss of natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for compensating the loss of biodiversity they generated have to be considered. This paper is the first synthesis of evidence addressing this topic for vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) in temperate ecosystems. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature survey using two online publication databases, three search engines, specialist websites, and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. We successively screened the articles for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize the retained studies and to critically appraise them. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for vertebrates, and the effects of landscape and management on these potentialities. We critically appraised all studies to assess their risk of bias and created a database of the studies with low and medium risk of bias. We synthesized results for each specific question in narrative syntheses. Finally, studies that met meta-analysis requirements were used for quantitative syntheses. Results: Our initial searches identified 83,565 documents. After critical appraisal, we retained 119 documents that reported 128 studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (49%) and in the United States of America (22%), and were about mammals (61%) and birds (20%). Results from the narrative synthesis and meta-analyses converged and revealed that the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges to constitute a habitat for vertebrate species varies according to the infrastructure and the biological group considered. Especially, highway verges may be a refuge for small mammals but seems detrimental to birds. The potential also varied depending on the landscape considered, with urbanisation being related to lower biodiversity hosted by verges. We found a wide variety of verge management practices with few studies on each practice, which prevented us from drawing general conclusions. Likewise, we found too few studies assessing the corridor potential of verges to be able to fully conclude although this potential seems to exist. We did not find any study assessing the effect of landscape context or management on the role of corridor of verges. Conclusions: We identified a major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for vertebrates, and when they exist studies rarely directly measured movements on verges. We thus encourage more research on this topic and the development of protocols that enable direct measures of vertebrate movements. The effect of management practices on the role of habitat of verges also deserves further investigations, and research efforts should be coordinated to focus on one specific practice (e.g. vegetation management). © 2020 The Author(s).","Amphibians and Bats and Biodiversity and Birds and Green infrastructure and Mammals and Refuge and Reptiles and Right of way and Roadside","10.1186/s13750-020-00196-7","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00196-7",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

Although urban green spaces support many pollinators, global estimates of urban pollinator diversity are still lacking. Here, we present a global overview of urban pollinators, characterizing the most frequently recorded species and functional groups, as well as the types of urban green spaces where these pollinators were most frequently recorded. A systematic review of the literature revealed a total of 11,560 pollinator records in urban green areas. These comprised 3148 species from 255 cities in 46 countries, with more than half of the studies (similar to 67 %) carried out in non-tropical cities. Hymenoptera was the main pollinator group recorded, especially bees, followed by Lepidoptera and Diptera worldwide. However, birds were more commonly reported in tropical than non-tropical regions, highlighting their importance as pollinators in the tropics. The most frequently recorded species were social and generalist bees, including invasive and managed species. Hence, while some bees may be able to persist in urban areas, other groups may face challenges that need to be considered when planning urban pollinator conservation. Considering the urban habitat types where pollinators were sampled, university campuses and gardens were the most common types investigated in tropical and non-tropical regions, respectively. These results may reflect regional differences in urban landscape characteristics, as well as a research bias caused by greater investment in urban ecology research in non-tropical countries. Our review synthetizes the diversity of urban pollinators worldwide and highlights the gaps and challenges in promoting their conservation more inclusively.","Apis and Bees and Bombus and Pollination and Urban green spaces and Urbanization and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and CITY and BEES and BIODIVERSITY and HYMENOPTERA and AREAS and ECOLOGY and HABITAT and FLOWERS and FLIES","10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110036","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110036",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

To date, research has largely focussed on the impacts of disturbance on animal population size, extinction risk and species richness. However, individual responses, such as changes in body condition, can act as more sensitive metrics and may provide early warning signs of reduced fitness and population declines. We conducted the first global systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the impacts of ecosystem disturbance on reptile and amphibian body condition. We collated 384 effect sizes representing 137 species from 133 studies. We tested how disturbance type, species traits, biome and taxon moderate the impacts of disturbance on body condition. We found an overall negative effect of disturbance on herpetofauna body condition (Hedges' g = −0.37, 95% CI: −0.57, −0.18). Disturbance type was an influential predictor of body condition response and all disturbance types had a negative mean effect. Drought, invasive species and agriculture had the largest effects. The impact of disturbance varied in strength and direction across biomes, with the largest negative effects found within Mediterranean and temperate biomes. In contrast, taxon, body size, habitat specialisation and conservation status were not influential predictors of disturbance effects. Our findings reveal the widespread effects of disturbance on herpetofauna body condition and highlight the potential role of individual-level response metrics in enhancing wildlife monitoring. The use of individual response metrics alongside population and community metrics would deepen our understanding of disturbance impacts by revealing both early impacts and chronic effects within affected populations. This could enable early and more informed conservation management. © 2023 The Authors.

"625","rayyan-674237255","Small things are important: the value of singular point elements for birds in agricultural landscapes","Biological Reviews","Farmland birds belong to the most endangered group of vertebrates in Europe. They are an important component of farmland biodiversity considering the numerous functions they perform (e.g. seed dispersal, improving germination, increasing gene flow, nutrient recycling, and pest control). Therefore, their decline imposes substantial risks on agricultural ecosystems. In general, farmland bird conservation includes land-use and management alterations leading to less-intensive farming and land-sparing for breeding habitats (e.g. agri-environment-climate schemes, and organic farming). However, theoretical concepts describing farmland biodiversity maintenance and applied conservation measures usually ignore the role of singular, often very small, natural or man-made elements in an agricultural landscape. These elements play a role in the populations of certain species, their biology and in the general species richness of farmland. Furthermore, the importance of these elements has never been empirically tested, which means that conservationists and practitioners are not aware of their measurable value for birds. Herein, we define and identify singular point elements in the agricultural landscape (SPELs) which are potentially important for breeding farmland birds. We also describe each SPEL and evaluate its importance for birds in farmland based on a systematic review of the available literature. Using a horizon-scanning technique, we then polled field ornithologists about their personal observations of birds in relation to SPELs and the evaluation of the potential roles of such structures for birds. We identified 17 SPELs that vary in naturalness and age: singular trees, singular shrubs, erratic boulders, puddles, electricity pylons, wind turbines, spiritual sites, hunting platforms, fence and border posts, wells, road signs, scarecrows, piles of manure, piles of brushwood/branches, piles of stones/debris, piles of lime, and haystacks. Analysis of the literature revealed knowledge gaps, because some SPELs are frequently mentioned in ecological studies (e.g. trees, shrubs, pylons), but others such as spiritual sites, stones, hunting platforms, wells, road signs, or piles of lime are ignored. Despite the fact that some authors incorporate the effects of some SPELs in their studies, little research to date has aimed to assess the impact of various SPELs on farmland bird species numbers and distribution. Horizon scanning revealed that ornithologists often observe birds on various SPELs and thus, attribute to SPELs many functions that are important for maintaining bird populations. Horizon scanning also highlighted the importance of SPELs for many declining bird species and suggested possible mitigation of negative changes in the agricultural landscape by retaining SPELs within fields. We suggest that a better understanding of the role of SPELs for farmland birds is required. We also recommend that SPELs are considered as a potential tool for the conservation of birds, and existing conservation programs such as agri-environment-climate schemes and organic farming should be updated accordingly. Finally, we suggest that SPELs are included in predictive models that evaluate habitat suitability for farmland biodiversity. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","agriculture and biodiversity and ecosystem services and farmland and landscape ecology and marginal habitat and novel habitat and point processes and singular elements and small landscape features","10.1111/brv.12707","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12707",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

However, it is difficult to directly link agricultural land use with biota response as agricultural stressors can also originate from other causes. Also, there is evidence for positive and negative effects of agriculture on organisms, agricultural impact differs strongly with the biological metric and study region considered and agricultural impact differs among practice and type, which in turn affects different organism groups with varying severity. Against this background, our study aimed at assessing, if agricultural land use has a consistent effect on river biota. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, which yielded 43 studies and 76 relationships between agriculture and aquatic organism groups. The relationships were subjected to a meta-analysis using Hedge’s g to calculate the standardized mean difference of effects. Overall, we detected a medium to strong effect g = − 0.74 of agricultural land use on freshwater biota, only marginally influenced by study design, river type and region. Strong differences in biota response could be observed depending on the biological metric assessed, with ecological quality indices of agricultural impairment performing best. Sensitive taxa declined with agricultural impact, while tolerant taxa tended to benefit. In addition, the biota response differed among agricultural types and practices and organism group, with macroinvertebrates showing the strongest effect. Our results quantify the effects of agriculture on riverine biota and suggest biological metric types for assessing agricultural impact. Further research is needed to discriminate between agricultural types and account for intensity. © 2022, The Author(s).","Benthic invertebrates and Diatoms and Farming and Fish and Macrophytes and Metrics and Review and Streams and agricultural land and aquatic organism and biodiversity and freshwater environment and pollution effect and river system","10.1186/s12302-022-00706-z","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-022-00706-z",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

Extensive grazing is among the forms of land use that have undergone the greatest changes. This represents one of the main threats to biodiversity; consequently, a comprehensive overview about the impacts on the biodiversity of changes that are happening in pastoral activities is needed. Moreover, a clear picture of the most widely studied geographical areas, habitats, and taxonomic groups needs to be developed in order to understand the situation. In this framework, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the publications related to the impacts of pastoral activities on animal biodiversity in Europe. We analysed 223 articles by searching the ISI Web of Science platform and combining keywords related to “pastoral activities” and ""biodiversity indicators”, applying a vote count approach, i.e. simply dividing articles into categories depending on their results (non-significant ones, significant positive results, significant negative ones). Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis on 33 articles, selecting those focusing on Arthropods (the most studied taxa). To understand the main gaps in this scientific topic, we focused on: i) the identification of the geographical, environmental, and temporal structure of the studies; ii) the description of the main target groups used as bio-indicators; iii) the comparison of different management practices (overgrazing, traditional, agri-environment schemes - AESs), plus land abandonment, to determine which is the best for biodiversity conservation and to evaluate the effectiveness of AESs. There was a bias towards lowlands in comparison to uplands, as well as a lack of long-term studies. Plants were more sensitive than animals to grazing changes. Arthropods’ orders are the taxa used most frequently as indicators, in comparison with vertebrates, especially birds. We identified a generalised negative impact of overgrazing in all the habitats and geographical areas, apparently except in mountainous shrubland. Conversely, land abandonment resulted in a negative influence on biodiversity only in the mountainous areas of southern Europe (underlining the important role of traditional activities), whereas short term abandonment had a beneficial role in central Europe, where overgrazing was more widespread. The meta-analysis suggested that arthropod richness was higher in short to mid-term abandoned pastures than under either extensive or intensive grazing systems. Finally, the effectiveness of AESs for conservation purposes was not confirmed by the vote count approach, whilst meta-analysis detected a positive effect for Arthropods of these same management practices when compared to overgrazing. We highlight a lack of data on AESs, especially when compared with traditional extensive grazing or abandonment. Our findings suggest that AES seems to effectively mimic traditional pastures, contrasting overgrazing, which is one of its main goal. Since AES have a strong potential in influencing sustainable management and promoting biodiversity conservation, the European Union should focus on the most effective and well targeted AES based on research, and further studies will be necessary to continuously assess their effect. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Agri-environment schemes and Biodiversity indicator and Invertebrates and Land abandonment and Overgrazing and Systematic-review and Europe and Animalia and Arthropoda and Aves and Invertebrata and Vertebrata and arthropod and biodiversity and bird and grazing pressure and habitat fragmentation and land use change and literature review and management practice and meta-analysis and pastoralism","10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125863","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125863",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

However, the extent to which LULCC is concurrently considered in climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) is unclear. Objectives: We identify trends in inclusion of LULCC and CC in vulnerability assessments of species and the direction and magnitude of their combined effect on biodiversity. Further, we examine the effect size of LULCC and CC in driving changes in “currencies” of response to CC, such as distribution, abundance and survival. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the last 30 years that focused on CCVA and accounted for impacts of both CC and LULCC. Results: Across 116 studies, 34% assumed CC and LULCC would act additively, while 66% allowed for interactive effects. The majority of CCVAs reported similar effect sizes for CC and LULCC, although they affected different CCVA currencies. Only 14% of the studies showed larger effects of CC than of LULCC. Another 14% showed larger effects of LULCC than CC, specifically for dispersal, population viability, and reproduction, which tend to be strongly affected by fragmentation and disturbance. Although most studies found that LULCC and CC had negative effects on species currencies, in some cases effects were neutral or even positive. Conclusions: CCVAs that incorporate LULCC provided a better account of drivers of vulnerability, and highlight aspects of drivers that are generally more amenable to on-the-ground management intervention than CCVAs that focus on CC alone. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change vulnerability assessment and Currencies and Impact and effect and Methodologies and Species","10.1007/s10980-021-01276-w","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-021-01276-w",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

A systematic review","Journal of Applied Ecology","Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (“DW enrichment”) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society","coarse woody debris and dead wood and diversity and forest conservation and forest restoration and habitat management and prescribed burning and saproxylic species and Aves and Fungi and Hexapoda and Reptilia and biodiversity and boreal forest and habitat restoration and nutrient enrichment and saproxylic organism and snag and temperate forest","10.1111/1365-2664.13395","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13395",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

However, the direct and indirect effects of these facilities on the mortality, occurrence and behaviour of rare and threatened species are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review to examine the potential impacts of WEF on grouse species. We studied whether grouse (1) collide with wind turbines, (2) show behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine developments, and (3) if there are documented effects of WEF on their population sizes or dynamics. Our review is based on 35 sources, including peer-reviewed articles as well as grey literature. Effects of wind turbine facilities on grouse have been studied for eight species. Five grouse species have been found to collide with wind turbines, in particular with the towers. Fifteen studies reported behavioural responses in relation to wind turbine facilities in grouse (seven species), including spatial avoidance, displacement of lekking or nesting sites, or the time invested in breeding vs. non-breeding behaviour. Grouse were affected at up to distances of 500 m by WEF infrastructure, with indications of effects also at bigger distances. In six cases, a local reduction in grouse abundance was reported in areas with wind turbines, which possibly affected population size. Due to the differences in study duration and design, we cannot provide general conclusions on the effects of WEF on grouse populations. We advise applying the precautionary principle by keeping grouse habitats free of wind energy developments, in particular where populations are small or locally threatened. Future studies should preferably apply a long-term before-after-control-impact design for multiple areas to allow for more general conclusions to be drawn on the effects of WEF on rare and threatened wildlife species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.","Before-after-control-impact design and Collision and Displacement and Habitat suitability and Tetraoninae and Wind turbine and Tetraonidae and anthropogenic effect and behavioral response and collision and design and displacement and gamebird and literature review and population size and wind power and wind turbine","10.1007/s10336-019-01696-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01696-1",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Summarised evidence"

When peat extraction is ceased, multiple after-use options exist, including abandonment, restoration, and replacement (e.g., forestry and agricultural use). However, there is a lack of a global synthesis of after-use research. Through a systematic review of 356 peer-reviewed scientific articles, we address this research gap and examine (1) what after-use options have been studied, (2) what the studied and recognized impacts of the after-use options are, and (3) what one can learn in terms of best practices and research gaps. The research has concentrated on the impacts of restoration (N = 162), abandonment (N = 72), and replacement (N = 94), the latter of which consists of afforestation (N = 46), cultivation (N = 34) and creation of water bodies (N = 14). The studies on abandonment, restoration, and creation of water bodies have focused mostly on analyzing vegetation and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, while the studies assessing afforestation and cultivation sites mostly evaluate the provisioning ecosystem services. The studies show that active restoration measures speed-up vegetation recolonization on bare peat areas, reduce GHG emissions and decrease negative impacts on water systems. The most notable research gap is the lack of studies comparing the environmental and social impacts of the after-use options. Additionally, there is a lack of studies focusing on social impacts and downstream hydrology, as well as long-term monitoring of GHG fluxes. Based on the reviewed studies, a comparison of the impacts of the after-use options is not straightforward.

Here, we review the academic literature examining mining impacts to ES. We found only 60 papers assessed impacts to ES, with the majority focused on coal mining. Regulating services, such as carbon storage and erosion prevention, were most commonly assessed. We observed considerable variation in ES definitions and conceptualisations with no methodological consistency in ES assessments among studies. While we found negative impacts on ES were attributed to active mining operations and some positive impacts were related to restoration activities, our results also highlight major limitations to managing ES in mining regions. Assessing the full extent of impacts to ES from mining requires clear identification of changes in the ES chain – from biophysical supply to benefits and human wellbeing throughout the mining lifecycle.

Artificial refuges are used across the globe to mitigate the impacts of a variety of threats on wildlife, such as habitat loss and degradation. However, there is little understanding of the science underpinning artificial refuges, and what comprises best practice for artificial refuge design and implementation for wildlife conservation. We address this gap by undertaking a systematic review of the current state of artificial refuge research for the conservation of wildlife. We identified 224 studies of artificial refuges being implemented in the field to conserve wildlife species. The current literature on artificial refuges is dominated by studies of arboreal species, primarily birds and bats. Threatening processes addressed by artificial refuges were biological resource use (26%), invasive or problematic species (20%), and agriculture (15%), yet few studies examined artificial refuges specifically for threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) species (7%). Studies often reported the characteristics of artificial refuges (i.e. refuge size, construction materials; 87%) and surrounding vegetation (35%), but fewer studies measured the thermal properties of artificial refuges (18%), predator activity (17%), or food availability (3%). Almost all studies measured occupancy of the artificial refuges by target species (98%), and over half measured breeding activity (54%), whereas fewer included more detailed measures of fitness, such as breeding productivity (34%) or animal body condition (4%). Evaluating the benefits and impacts of artificial refuges requires sound experimental design, but only 39% of studies compared artificial refuges to experimental controls, and only 10% of studies used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. As a consequence, few studies of artificial refuges can determine their overall effect on individuals or populations. We outline a series of key steps in the design, implementation, and monitoring of artificial refuges that are required to avoid perverse outcomes and maximise the chances of achieving conservation objectives. This review highlights a clear need for increased rigour in studies of artificial refuges if they are to play an important role in wildlife conservation. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","artificial habitat and artificial refuges and conservation and experimental design and habitat loss and habitat restoration and nest box and offset and refuges and wildlife","10.1111/brv.12776","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12776",NA,NA,NA,"artificial","Summarised evidence"

These structures are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore cost-effective design is essential. Although there has been much research to date on the factors affecting the usage of WCS by wildlife, no attempt has been made to synthesize these results and assess the current state of knowledge. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific and professional literature to assess the state of empirical evidence on WCS and a meta-analysis to explore the factors that influence their effectiveness. We identified a total of 270 studies that reported empirical results spanning four decades of research. Most studies (161) measured the number of crossing events without monitoring approaches to the structure, thus limiting the ability to assess WCS effectiveness. Only 77 studies measured the proportion of successful crossings to approaches, which was the type of data used for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results show that viaducts are the most effective type of WCS for large mammals. For example, the odds of ungulates crossing through a viaduct are 2.9 times that of an overpass, and 3.6 times that of an underpass. WCS built specifically for wildlife are used significantly more than those built for dual use by humans and wildlife. For large carnivores, the odds of using a dedicated WCS are 15.9 times that of a structure used concurrently by humans. We additionally found that natural materials and round shapes are preferable in the design of effective WCS. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of adopting large-scale monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. More broadly, we conclude that further research focusing on under-studied species and structure characteristics is needed to facilitate cost-effective mitigation efforts that reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and promote wildlife conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation and Fragmentation mitigation and Habitat fragmentation and Road ecology and Wildlife corridors and Wildlife crossing structures and Mammalia and Ungulata and Biodiversity and Bridges and Conservation and Factor analysis and Mammals and Animal movement and Meta-analysis and Systematic Review and Wildlife conservation and Wildlife crossing structure and biodiversity and habitat corridor and habitat fragmentation and meta-analysis and reserve design and roadside environment and wildlife management and carnivore and comparative effectiveness and conservation biology and ecology and human and mammal and meta analysis and nonhuman and review and systematic review and ungulate and wildlife conservation and Cost effectiveness","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146061","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146061",NA,NA,NA,"Forest, various","Summarised evidence"

This may lead to high population densities with impacts on both human livelihoods and wildlife conservation. Cranes are a group of 15 species worldwide, affected both negatively and positively by agricultural practices. While eleven species face critical population declines, numbers of common cranes (Grus grus) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) have increased drastically in the last 40 years. Their increase is associated with higher incidences of crane foraging on agricultural crops, causing financial losses to farmers. Our aim was to synthesize scientific knowledge on the bilateral effects of land use change and crane populations. We conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed publications on agriculture-crane interactions (n = 135) and on the importance of agricultural crops in the diet of cranes (n = 81). Agricultural crops constitute a considerable part of the diet of all crane species (average of 37%, most frequently maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)). Crop damage was identified in only 10% of all agriculture-crane interactions, although one-third of interactions included cranes foraging on cropland. Using a conceptual framework analysis, we identified two major pathways in agriculture-crane interactions: (1) habitat loss with negative effects on crane species dependent on specific habitats, and (2) expanding agricultural habitats with superabundant food availability beneficial for opportunistic crane species. The degree to which crane species can adapt to agricultural land use changes may be an important factor explaining their population response. We conclude that multi-objective management needs to combine land sparing and land sharing strategies at landscape scale. To support viable crane populations while guaranteeing sustainable agricultural production, it is necessary to include the perspectives of diverse stakeholders and streamline conservation initiatives and agricultural policy accordingly. © 2022 The Authors.

We find that progress has been made in understanding key SES properties in coastal and marine ecosystems, which include resilience, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and governance. A variety of methods has been developed and applied to analyze these features qualitatively and quantitatively. We also find that recent studies have incorporated land-based stressors in their analyses of coastal issues related to nutrient runoff, bacterial pollution, and management of anadromous species to represent explicit links in land-to-sea continuums. However, the literature has yet to identify methods and data that can be used to provide causal evidence of non-linearities and thresholds within SES.

The common biodiversity declines in monocultures may be mitigated by intercropping, which means diversification with multiple crops in the same field. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using data from 18 countries published in 63 articles, to quantitatively assess the overall effect size of intercropping on beneficial arthropods and pest populations. We also evaluated whether the effect of intercropping varies between different crop combinations and with the spatial arrangement of crops. We used monoculture as a control system, which served as a proxy for agricultural intensification. We found that intercropping, compared to monoculture, significantly increased the overall abundance of beneficial arthropods by 36%, density by 94%, and species richness by 27%. Intercropping reduced 38% of the abundance and 41% of the density of arthropod pests, while their species richness was not affected. Intercropping consistently affected positively the species richness of pollinators, parasitoids, and predators. The combination of cereal-legume outperformed cereal-cereal in promoting beneficial arthropods while reducing pests. Regarding spatial arrangement, row and strip were more effective than mixed and relay intercropping in supporting beneficial arthropods and controlling pests. According to our results, intercropping is an effective practice to mitigate the adverse impacts of agricultural intensification on beneficial arthropods in agroecosystems. Our findings may encourage farmers to adopt intercropping over intensive monoculture and policymakers to consider incentives for intercropping in agri-environmental schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Agri-environmental schemes and Agroecology and Biodiversity conservation and Ecological intensification and Polyculture vs. monoculture and agricultural intensification and agroecology and arthropod and biodiversity and intercropping and land use and meta-analysis and monoculture and pest control and species richness","10.1016/j.agee.2023.108617","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108617",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions between a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities. © 2020 The Author","Circus sp. and Collision risk and Displacement and Grey literature and Harrier and Impact assessment and Animals and Animals, Wild and Birds and Ecosystem and Energy-Generating Resources and Wind and Aves and Circus and Electric utilities and Fossil fuels and Sustainable development and Conservation priorities and Environmental benefits and High sensitivity and Knowledge accessibilities and Knowledge-sharing and Online repositories and Systematic Review and Wind energy development and accessibility and anthropogenic effect and collision and displacement and environmental impact assessment and geographical distribution and knowledge and language and literature review and raptor and wildlife management and wind power and Circus (genus) and grey literature and habitat and human and human experiment and nonhuman and physician and review and systematic review and wildlife and wind farm and animal and bird and ecosystem and energy resource and wild animal and wind and Wind power","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140238","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140238",NA,NA,NA,"Mountains","Summarised evidence"

A systematic review","Environmental Evidence","Background: In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition? Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Review findings: During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests. Conclusions: The findings of this review show that small protected patches within production forests are important part of biodiversity conservation. They cannot substitute larger protected areas but supplement the protected area network. However, there were gaps both in geographical distribution of the studies as well as in the selection of target species of the studies. Therefore, generalization of the results must be done carefully. © 2021, The Author(s).","Abundance and Assemblage and Dead wood and Forest harvesting and Impact and Logging and Species diversity and Species richness and Voluntary conservation and Woodland key habitats and Trees","10.1186/s13750-020-00216-6","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00216-6",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Understanding the environmental and societal impacts of land-use change (LUC) to bioenergy crops is important in determining where and how they could be deployed, and the resulting trade-offs and co-benefits. We use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the existing literature on two poorly understood impacts of this LUC that are likely to have an important effect on public acceptability: cultural ecosystem services and biodiversity. We focus on the impact of LUC to non-food bioenergy crops on agricultural landscapes, where large-scale bioenergy planting may be required. Our meta-analysis finds strong benefits for biodiversity overall (up 75% ± 13%), with particular benefits for bird abundance (+81% ± 32%), bird species richness (+100% ± 31%), arthropod abundance (+52% ± 36%), microbial biomass (+77% ± 24%), and plant species richness (+25% ± 22%), when land moves out of either arable crops or grassland to bioenergy production. Conversions from arable land to energy trees led to particularly strong benefits, providing an insight into how future LUC to non-food bioenergy crops could support biodiversity. There were inadequate data to complete a meta-analysis on the effects of non-food bioenergy crops on cultural ecosystem services, and few generalizable conclusions from a systematic review of the literature, however, findings highlight the importance of landscape context and planting strategies in determining impact. Our findings demonstrate improved farm-scale biodiversity on agricultural land with non-food bioenergy crops, but also limited knowledge concerning public response to this LUC, which could prove crucial to the successful expansion of bioenergy to meet the Paris targets. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aesthetic value and BECCS and Biodiversity and Bioenergy crops and Ecosystem services and Meta-analysis and Public acceptance and Arthropoda and Biofuels and Biomass and Birds and Carbon capture and Crops and Digital storage and Economic and social effects and Ecosystems and Fossil fuels and Fuel storage and Land use and Plants (botany) and Bio-energy and Landuse change and Plantings and Systematic Review and biodiversity and bioenergy and ecosystem service and land use change and literature review and meta-analysis","10.1088/1748-9326/ac22be","https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac22be",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

Agri-environment schemes may partly compensate for these losses and enhance arthropod populations, but their effectiveness is higher in simple landscapes rather than complex landscapes, characterized by a large proportion and diversity of semi-natural areas. As the landscape-scale species pool is known to drive local species richness, we tested our hypothesis that landscape complexity determines local arthropod species richness, whereas local management affects only arthropod abundance. Here we undertake a meta-analysis as part of a wider systematic review of the effects of land use heterogeneity on arthropod species richness. We searched for studies quantifying the effects of agri-environment schemes (e.g. wildflower strips/areas, grassy field margins, organic farming) and landscape complexity on arthropod richness and abundance. We additionally separated vegetation- vs. ground-dwelling taxa, because the effects were hypothesized to be greater in the more mobile vegetation-dwelling taxa. As expected, increasing landscape complexity enhanced arthropod richness, but not their abundance. Unexpectedly, agri-environment schemes did not only support the abundance of arthropods, but also their species richness. This pattern was driven by the vegetation-dwelling, not the ground-dwelling taxa, presumably because the higher mobility of vegetation-dwelling taxa allows faster responses to environmental changes. Our results show that agri-environment schemes in Europe benefit both arthropod abundance and species richness, whereas increasing landscape complexity primarily enhances species richness. This is why both local and landscape management need to be taken into account to halt current biodiversity losses in agricultural landscapes. Agri-environment schemes need to be implemented at a larger spatial and temporal scales to enhance landscape complexity, maintaining or restoring biodiversity sustainably. © 2021 The Authors","Bees and Biodiversity and Butterflies and Carabids and Ecosystem services and Spiders and Europe and Araneae and Arthropoda and Papilionoidea and agricultural land and agricultural production and arthropod and biodiversity and environmental change and heterogeneity and landscape ecology and landscape structure and relative abundance and species pool and species richness and sustainability","10.1016/j.agee.2021.107822","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107822",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

This is posing concerns about their environmental impact and it is fostering research on biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services in this agroecosystem. With this systematic review, we aim at providing a global and comprehensive overview of the current research on biodiversity and biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services in vineyards, considering the effects of landscape features and management practices. We carried out a systematic literature search on the Web of Science Core Collection database. Literature was filtered according to several criteria, resulting in a final collection of 218 papers published between 1995 and 2018 and referring to different organism groups (from microbes to vertebrates) and two spatial scales (local and landscape). The results of the studies are often contrasting and taxon- and scale-dependent, thus hindering conclusions at the global scale. However, at least three main points of practical relevance can be fixed: (i) organic viticulture weakly enhances biodiversity at the landscape scale, whereas contrasting effects have been found at the local scale; (ii) ground vegetation management by cover cropping and the conservation of native ground cover strongly promotes biodiversity; (iii) habitat heterogeneity at the landscape and local scales is a key element for biodiversity. Several studies support the view that promoting biodiversity in vineyard-dominated landscapes could also positively impact on several ecosystem services. Our study further revealed knowledge gaps that should be filled by future research. In particular, important geographical areas for wine production, as well as several organism groups, have been completely neglected.

However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4–29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery.

Often, rows of trees delineate crop alleys in a field (alley-cropping system). SAS have the potential to provide many agricultural and environmental benefits, are innovative in their modern form, and are becoming more widespread. These diversified farming systems have the potential to influence biodiversity and related ecosystem services (ES). This systematic review seeks to assess the link between temperate SAS and biodiversity at all main taxonomical levels (bacteria and fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). We describe the response of biodiversity in terms of abundance, species richness and other diversity indices. This study concerns not only the potential interest of these systems for biodiversity conservation, but also the impacts of living organisms present in the system on ES and eventually ecosystem disservices. We obtained 3458 references dealing with both agroforestry and biodiversity from the Web of Sciences database. Among them, 45 articles corresponded to our specific subject and met the selection criteria. These publications were retained for further analysis. SAS have a positive impact on biodiversity conservation by increasing the abundance or diversity of the different taxonomic groups. Regarding ES, the few papers that studied the effect on pollinators or pollination also showed a positive effect. The majority of studies on natural predators and biocontrol and most of those concerning soil organisms and related supporting services showed a positive effect of SAS. However, some studies found no positive effect or even reported a negative effect in specific conditions. Data is limited for weeds, pests and damage to crop production, and results contrast according to studies and conditions. The review lists the different parameters that influence biodiversity and the subsequent services. These parameters can be divided into three main groups, namely crop management, the influence of the crop location, and agroforestry management. We also report the influence of the experimental design, for example the use of control and comparison or sampling methods. Moreover, the link with other ES is discussed (mainly in terms of provisioning but also for cultural services). Finally, we suggest future research avenues and propose advice in line with the issues discussed in this work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Agroecosystem and Agroforestry and Alley cropping and Biodiversity conservation and Ecosystem services and Multifunctionality and Tree-based intercropping and agricultural ecosystem and agroforestry and alley cropping and biodiversity and database and ecosystem service","10.1016/j.agee.2023.108480","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108480",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture","Summarised evidence"

The increasing pressures being placed on urban environments by global climate change and the need to create sustainable food systems contributes to rising interest in green infrastructure and urban agriculture solutions. Yet, few studies have systematically assessed the ecosystem service provision of urban agriculture and green infrastructure in parallel. In this systematic review of 157 peer-reviewed journal articles, we synthesize the benefits and disbenefits of implementing various forms of urban agriculture and green infrastructure for the delivery of ecosystem services in urban areas. While both provide a diverse variety of ecosystem services, our review suggests that some services are provided more prevalently when green infrastructure is solely adopted (e.g., Local Climate and Air Quality Regulation), while other services are best delivered when green infrastructure is combined with urban agriculture (e.g., Biological Control and Maintenance of Genetic Diversity). Our data also show that ecosystem service delivery is partly modulated by the spaces in which urban growing takes place. Community Gardens, Green Spaces, Allotments, and Parks are found to be most conducive for diverse service provision, although it is also clear that some growing spaces have not been studied as frequently in urban ecosystem service research. We conclude by highlighting some key research gaps and priorities for urban ecosystem service research, including a stronger focus on under-represented services and growing spaces, the need for more systematic data collection, and the value of incorporating ecosystem service assessments into wider suitability and cost-benefit analyses. © 2022 The Authors","Ecosystem services and Green infrastructure and Growing space and Urban agriculture","10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.101405","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.101405",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"
"651","rayyan-674259646","The Shrinking Resource Base of Pastoralism: Saami Reindeer Husbandry in a Climate of Change","FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS","The productive performance of large ungulates in extensive pastoral grazing systems is modulated simultaneously by the effects of climate change and human intervention independent of climate change. The latter includes the expansion of private, civil and military activity and infrastructure and the erosion of land rights. We used Saami reindeer husbandry in Norway as a model in which to examine trends in, and to compare the influence of, both effects on a pastoral grazing system. Downscaled projections of mean annual temperature over the principal winter pasture area (Finnmarksvidda) closely matched empirical observations across 34 years to 2018. The area, therefore, is not only warming but seems likely to continue to do so. Warming notwithstanding, 50-year (1969-2018) records of local weather (temperature, precipitation and characteristics of the snowpack) demonstrate considerable annual and decadal variation which also seems likely to continue and alternately to amplify and to counter net warming. Warming, moreover, has both positive and negative effects on ecosystem services that influence reindeer. The effects of climate change on reindeer pastoralism are evidently neither temporally nor spatially uniform, nor indeed is the role of climate change as a driver of change in pastoralism even clear. The effects of human intervention on the system, by contrast, are clear and largely negative. Gradual liberalization of grazing rights from the 18th Century has been countered by extensive loss of reindeer pasture. Access to similar to 50% of traditional winter pasture was lost in the 19th Century owing to the closure of international borders to the passage of herders and their reindeer. Subsequent to this the area of undisturbed pasture within Norway has decreased by 71%. Loss of pasture due to piecemeal development of infrastructure and to administrative encroachment that erodes herders' freedom of action on the land that remains to them, are the principal threats to reindeer husbandry in Norway today. These tangible effects far exceed the putative effects of current climate change on the system. The situation confronting Saami reindeer pastoralism is not unique: loss of pasture and administrative, economic, legal and social constraints bedevil extensive pastoral grazing systems across the globe.","Arctic and climate change and encroachment and grazing rights and infrastructure and pastoralism and reindeer and Saami and RANGIFER-TARANDUS-TARANDUS and SEMI-DOMESTICATED REINDEER and PLANT COMMUNITY RESPONSES and WILD REINDEER and WOODLAND CARIBOU and HABITAT SELECTION and POPULATION TRENDS and MIGRATORY CARIBOU and POWER-LINES and RANGE USE","10.3389/fsufs.2020.585685     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.585685",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Summarised evidence"
