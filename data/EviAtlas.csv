Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of “adaptive management”, where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway’s Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK – which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.","Norway","10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.063","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.063",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil? Location: West andmid-Norway. Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect. Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower. Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.","abandonment and boreal and climate and functional diversity and functional traits and plant diversity and plant species richness and semi-natural grasslands and soil and taxonomic diversity and FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY and SPECIES RICHNESS and TRAIT RESPONSES and VEGETATION and IMPACT and PRODUCTIVITY and ECOSYSTEMS and STRATEGIES and MANAGEMENT and FRAMEWORK","10.1111/jvs.12543     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12543",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

A systematic review of the social and ecological impacts of the establishment of protected areas","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

"5","rayyan-674239715","Beaver canals and their environmental effects","Progress in Physical Geography","Beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams, despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas. In this study, we completed a systematic review of previous research on the structure and ecosystem effects of beaver canals to provide an increasingly holistic understanding of these landscape features. Specifically, we: 1) summarized why, where, when, and how beaver develop canals; 2) chronicled all published descriptions on beaver canal morphology; and 3) summarized the literature on the environmental effects of beaver canals. Thirty-one relevant studies were identified and incorporated into this review. Beaver canals have been identified in numerous environments ranging from largely undeveloped mountainous regions to heavily developed agricultural landscapes. Beaver primarily develop canals to increase accessibility to riparian resources, facilitate transport of harvested resources, and to decrease predation risk. As with beaver dams, beaver canals exhibit large structural variability, particularly in lengths, which can be over 0.5 km. Widths of about 1 m and depths of about 0.5 m are common. Beaver canals alter watershed hydrology by creating new aquatic habitats, connecting isolated aquatic features, and diverting water into colonized areas. Beaver canals have been identified as favored habitats for several biotic species and are sometimes used during critical life stages (e.g. dispersal). In addition to increasing overall floral and faunal species richness and diversity, beaver canals may benefit biota by mitigating habitat fragmentation and climate change impacts. Based on the results of this review, incorporating beaver canals into stream restoration practices may be environmentally beneficial. © The Author(s) 2019.","Beaver and canal and ecosystem engineer and keystone species and restoration and agricultural land and climate change and climate effect and dam and environmental effect and environmental restoration and habitat fragmentation and hydrology and watershed","10.1177/0309133319873116","https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133319873116",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unlike other types of renewable energies such as wind and hydroelectricity, evidence on the effects of PV installations on biodiversity has been building up only fairly recently and suggests that they may directly impact ecosystems and species through, for instance, habitat change and loss, mortality, behaviour alteration or population displacements. Hence, we conducted a systematic map of existing evidence aiming at answering the following question: what evidence exists regarding the effects of PV installations on wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species? Methods: We searched for relevant citations on four online publication databases, on Google Scholar, on four specialised websites and through a call for grey literature. Citations were then screened for eligibility in order to only retain citations referring to wild terrestrial and semi-aquatic species as well as PV and solar thermal installations, therefore excluding concentrated solar power. Accepted articles were first split into studies (corresponding to one experimental design) subjected to critical appraisal and then further split into observations (i.e. one population and one outcome) during metadata extraction. The current state of the literature was characterised and knowledge clusters and gaps identified. Review findings: Searching captured 8121 unique citations, which resulted in 158 relevant articles being accepted after screening. Even though the first article was published in 2005, the publication rate increased rapidly in 2020. The 97 included primary research and modelling articles were split into 137 unique studies and rated with either a low (43.8%), a high (41.6%) or an unclear overall risk of bias (14.6%) after internal validity assessment. Studies were further split into 434 observations, mainly carried out in the United States (23.0%) and the United Kingdom (21.0%), preferentially in temperate climates (64.5%). Plants and arthropods were the two most studied taxa (41.7% and 26.3%, respectively). Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) facilities were most often investigated (70.1%). Observations mainly focused on the effect of the presence of PV installations (51.8%). Species abundance, community composition and species diversity were the most common outcomes assessed (23.0%, 18.4% and 16.1%, respectively). Conclusions: Three knowledge clusters for which a systematic review should be contemplated were identified: (i) the effects of PV installations on plant and (ii) arthropod communities and, (iii) their effects at a larger ecosystem scale on overall species abundance. However, the currently available evidence regarding the effects of photovoltaic installations on biodiversity is still scarce. More research is urgently needed on non-flying mammals and bats as well as amphibians and reptiles. Solar thermal panels and floating PV installations should also be further investigated. Studies comparing different designs of PV installations, management practices or contexts should be conducted as well. Indeed, more evidence is still needed to allow decision-makers to accurately and reliably select the types of PV installations and management practices that are least damaging to biodiversity. © 2023, The Author(s).","Conservation and Energy transition and Evidence synthesis and Floating solar and Green infrastructure and Ground-mounted photovoltaic and Solar panels and Wildlife","10.1186/s13750-023-00318-x","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-023-00318-x",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Multiple ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

We reviewed the literature for empirical evidence that ecotourism protects forests. Our conclusions are at once both sobering and encouraging. Ecotourism, as it is typically practiced, leads to deforestation. However, when accompanied by conservation mechanisms (e.g. protected area, Payment for Ecosystem Services, monitoring/enforcement), ecotourism can protect forests. Ecotourism sometimes leads to forest regeneration in agrarian landscapes, but trade-offs, for example old-growth deforestation or water pollution, may occur. From a methodological perspective, we found a dearth (only 17) of articles that empirically analyzed ecotourism impacts on forests, and no studies that used counterfactual impact evaluation approaches. We conclude that there is an insufficient evidence base for inferring effects of ecotourism on forests, and we identify research priorities to build knowledge about how, when, and where to implement ecotourism.","LAND-USE CHANGE and PROTECTED AREAS and CONSERVATION and TOURISM and DEFORESTATION and REGION and DEGRADATION and RESERVE","10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.004",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Forest","Summarised evidence"

Thinning reduces competitive pressure in the forest by repeatedly reducing the tree density of forest stands, thereby increasing the productivity of plantations. Considering the impact of thinning on vegetation and physiological and ecological traits, for this study, we used Norway spruce (Picea abies) data from three sites in the PROFOUND dataset to parameterize the 3-PG model in stages. The calibrated 3-PG model was used to simulate the stand diameter at breast height and the stem, root, and leaf biomass data on a monthly scale. The 3PG-MT-LSTM model uses 3-PG simulation data as the input variable. The model uses a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) as a shared layer and introduces multi-task learning (MTL). Based on the compatibility rules, the interpretability of the model was further improved. The models were trained using single-site and multi-site data, respectively, and multiple indicators were used to evaluate the model accuracy and generalization ability. Our preliminary results show that, compared with the process model and LSTM algorithm without MTL and compatibility rules, the hybrid model has higher biomass simulation accuracy and shows a more realistic biomass response to environmental driving factors. To illustrate the potential applicability of the model, we applied light (10%), moderate (20%), and heavy thinning (30%) at intervals of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years. Then, we used three climate scenarios—SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5—to simulate the growth of Norway spruce. The hybrid model can effectively capture the impact of climate change and artificial management on stand growth. In terms of climate, temperature and solar radiation are the most important factors affecting forest growth, and under warm conditions, the positive significance of forest management is more obvious. In terms of forest management practices, less frequent light-to-moderate thinning can contribute more to the increase in forest carbon sink potential; high-intensity thinning can support large-diameter timber production. In summary, moderate thinning should be carried out every 10 years in the young-aged forest stage. It is also advisable to perform light thinning procedures after the forest has progressed into a middle-aged forest stage. This allows for a better trade-off of the growth relationship between stand yield and diameter at breast height (DBH). The physical constraint-based hybrid modeling approach is a practical and effective tool. It can be used to measure long-term dynamic changes in forest production and then guide management activities such as thinning to achieve sustainable forest management. © 2023 by the authors.","3-PG model and biomass compatibility and forest biomass modeling and forest thinning and LSTM and Biomass and Data and DBH and Ecology and Forestry and Growth and Sustainable Forest Management and Thinnings and Climate change and Climate models and Learning systems and Long short-term memory and Multilayer neural networks and Neural network models and Physiological models and Plants (botany) and Sustainable development and Timber and Biomass compatibility and Biomass models and Forest biomass and Forest biomass modeling and Forest thinnings and Hybrid model and Long short-term memory neural network and Neural-networks and accuracy assessment and climate effect and computer simulation and coniferous tree and evergreen tree and forest management and growth rate and growth response and numerical model and prediction and stand structure and sustainable forestry and thinning and Trees","10.3390/f14071482","https://doi.org/10.3390/f14071482",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context, social learning is valuable to inform stakeholders of the efficacy of riparian vegetation in mitigating stream degradation. We aim to develop a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for application as a learning tool to simulate and assess the reach- and segment-scale effects of riparian vegetation properties and land use on instream invertebrates. We surveyed reach-scale riparian conditions, extracted segment-scale riparian and subcatchment land use information from geographic information system data, and collected macroinvertebrate samples from four catchments in Europe (Belgium, Norway, Romania, and Sweden). We modelled the ecological condition based on the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index, a macroinvertebrate-based index widely used in European bioassessment, as a function of different riparian variables using the BBN modelling approach. The results of the model simulations provided insights into the usefulness of riparian vegetation attributes in enhancing the ecological condition, with reach-scale riparian vegetation quality associated with the strongest improvements in ecological status. Specifically, reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 3 (i.e. moderate quality) generally results in the highest probability of a good ASPT score (99–100%). In contrast, a site with a narrow width of riparian trees and a small area of trees with reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 1 (i.e. low quality) predicts a high probability of a bad ASPT score (74%). The strengths of the BBN model are the ease of interpretation, fast simulation, ability to explicitly indicate uncertainty in model outcomes, and interactivity.

Our research leads us to three findings. First, avian diversity was significantly higher in the spruce birch polycultures. Second, spruce birch polycultures exclusively attracted broadleaf-associated bird species and retained the majority of conifer-associated bird species found in the spruce monocultures. Third, avian biodiversity within the spruce birch polycultures did not incorporate threatened taxa. We suggest that in addition to the apparent benefits for stand level diversity, widespread use of spruce birch polycultures could provide a means of softening the matrix for broadleaved-associated species, while concurrently providing an increased broadleaf base from which future conservation actions could be implemented. Our results are relevant to multi-use forestry, and recent policy initiatives by forest certification agencies which aim to increase broadleaf-associated biodiversity within conifer-dominated production forest landscapes.","biodiversity and conservation and sustainable forestry and CLIMATE-CHANGE and ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION and NORTHERN EUROPE and NORWAY SPRUCE and FOREST and BIRDS and BIODIVERSITY and ABUNDANCE and STANDS and DISTRIBUTIONS and Sweden and Betula","10.14214/sf.92     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.92",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The degree of compliance with biodiversity measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001 and the Norwegian standard ""Living Forests'') was compared in a field study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21% of the postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41% had either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road transport, little improvement was seen.

Different domestic animal species graze in different areas of the landscape. Therefore, grazing stocks composed of different species have an unequal effect on the landscape. This study compares the influence of four domestic animal species (cattle, sheep, goats, reindeer) on landscape dynamics in Jotunheimen, a Norwegian mountain range. Interviews and maps showing grazing land of domestic animals were performed to collect information about land use in the summer farm surroundings. Grazing pressure maps (prior to 1960 and 1960-2002) using the land use information obtained, and vegetation maps (from the 1960s and 2002) using aerial photographs, were digitized. Vegetation was spatially linked with grazing pressure using GIS and multiple multinomial and linear regressions were used to investigate each species' effect on vegetation type change and displacement of the forest line, respectively. The results show that cattle grazing influenced transitions from grasslands, cattle together with goats affected transitions from heaths, and cattle, goats, and reindeer influenced displacement of the birch forest line. High grazing pressure from these three domestic animals suppressed forest and scrub establishment in open habitats. Only goats, however, caused transitions from scrub and birch forest to open vegetation types. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the amounts of dead wood and bark surface on high-stumps are small compared to the amount on the ordinary cut stumps and further there have been no studies on the fauna of ordinary cut stumps. By sieving bark from ordinary (low) stumps and high-stumps (at ground level and at breast height) of Norway spruce we investigated whether there were differences in the saproxylic beetle community between low-stumps, high-stumps at ground level and high-stumps at breast height.

In Sweden during the last decade, naturally downed logs have been retained and, at clearcuts, high stumps have been artificially created to maintain saproxylic (dead wood dependent) insects. We tested how much these types of dead wood are used by sampling saproxylic beetles in dead wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.; Pinaceae) in managed forests in central Sweden. To analyse how surveys should be conducted in these kinds of studies, we compared three methods over an entire growing season. We found that the relationship between the type of dead wood and species richness was statistically significant when we used bark sieving and emergence traps, but not when we used window traps. It is impossible to ascertain whether beetles collected with window traps are related to the type of dead wood on which they are found and, therefore, such traps are less useful in studies of specific substrates. The yield from sieving was highest in spring and autumn, whereas species richness in window trap samples peaked in June and July and that in emergence traps peaked from May to July. With emergence traps we collected, on average, about twice the number of species over the whole season as we did by sieving on a single occasion in the spring. Both emergence trapping and sieving reveal what is present in individual pieces of dead wood, but these methods sample partly different faunas. We found fewer species on artificially created high stumps (on clearcuts); however, these stumps seem to be useful for some red-listed species.","OLD-GROWTH and DECAYING WOOD and BOREAL FOREST and DEAD WOOD and REQUIREMENTS and INSECTS and SWEDEN and Norway","10.4039/N04-104     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.4039/N04-104",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

To determine to what degree this practice challenges timber production and wildlife management, we need a better understanding of basic cattle ecology. What do cattle, typical grazers, feed on in a habitat typically used by browsers? We determined cattle's resource use and selection at three scales: habitat and microhabitat selection when foraging and diet selection. Boreal forest is dominated by grass-poor habitats, and despite their strong selection for grass-rich habitats, cows spent a lot of time in suboptimal habitats, like old bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) spruce (Picea abies) forest. However, they managed to find grass-rich habitat patches within those, selecting for patches with bentgrass (Agrostis spp.). Graminoids, mainly wavy hair-grass (Avenella spp.), tussock grass (Deschampsia), and true sedges (Carex spp.), made up the biggest part of the fecal samples. Woody plants, mainly willow (Salix spp.), Vaccinium spp., pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.), made up 9.4% ± 4.7% of the samples, a value lower than reported for other forest grazing cattle. Cattle avoided woody plants in their diet and selected for graminoids. They preferred deciduous over coniferous species. At these low stocking densities, the cows were grazers in this browser's habitat. Moreover, they selected rather on habitat and patch scale than for individual plants within a given habitat patch, considered typical for a grazer. Their grass-rich diet indicates little overlap with the diet of local wild ungulates, which are mostly browsers. Their aversion of spruce and selection for graminoids and deciduous trees indicates low conflict risk for browsing damages and even a beneficial weeding effect on trees planted for timber production. © 2023 The Author(s)","Beef cattle and Feeding ecology and Picea abies and Resource selection and Silvopastoralism and Norway and boreal forest and browsing and cattle and diet and feeding ecology and grazing and habitat selection and pastoralism and pasture and pine and resource use and Cattle and Trees","10.1016/j.rama.2023.12.004","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2023.12.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Here, we show the significance of a nature-based solution to a landfill-contaminated aquifer in southeast Norway. Groundwater physicochemical parameters monitored for twenty-eight years were used as a proxy to infer natural remediation. Results show that concentrations of the major chemical variables decreased with time and distance until they tailed off. An exception to this was sulphate, which showed an increase, but apparently, exhibits a stationary phase. The water types were found to be most similar between samples from active landfill and post-closure stages, while samples from the stabilised stage showed a different water type. All the chemical parameters of samples from the stabilised stage were found to be within the Norwegian drinking water standards, except iron and manganese, which were only marginally above the limits, an indication of a possible recovery of this aquifer. The findings highlight the significance of natural attenuation processes in remediating contaminated aquifers and have significant consequences for future contamination management, where natural remediation can be viewed as an alternative worth exploring. This is promising in the wake of calls for sustainable remediation management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).",NA,"10.1038/s41598-021-94041-7","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94041-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Both herds were being regularly hunted (man had been a natural predator on reindeer since prehistoric time). The well-fed Knutsho animals were ca. 30% larger at the start of the hunting season in late August. Before exposure they foraged less and walked more, i.e. were more selective than the Hardangervidda animals which were in energetically lower condition and foraged significantly more and spent less time moving between habitat patches and less time standing. After exposure to hunters disturbed Knutsho animals aggregated into significantly larger groups than before hunting and stood alert more, while Hardangervidda animals spent the same minimum amount of time foraging but moved significantly more and spent almost no time standing. The frequency of disturbance was not significantly different between the two herds and their speeds of movement after disturbances were similar. The hunter kill success rate was also similar in the two areas. The energetic costs, measured as relative body weight loss during the hunting season, was higher for the initially less well-fed Hardangervidda animals, and higher for both herds compared to that from a less disturbed herd (Forelhogna). We hypothezise that while standing still and alert in aggregated groups is risky, it is still more risky to move, but potentially more rewarding if a better habitat could be found. More well-fed Knutsho animals, which aggregated and stood still, conserved allready stored energy, compatible with a time minimizer risk aversive strategy. The Hardangervidda animals which were in poorer condition increased travelling time to an extent that suggested a risky nutrient miximizer strategy in the phase of stress.

Begge flokker er regelmessig jaktet pa (menneske har vaert naturlig predator pa rein siden forhistorisk tid). De velnaerte rein pa Knutsho var 30% tyngre enn sine artsfeller pa Hardangervidda ved starten av jaktsesongen sent i august. For jakten beitet de mindre og gikk mer, d.v.s. var mer selektive enn Hardangerviddareinen. Disse var energetisk sett i en darligere forfatning, beitet mer og brukte mindre tid bade til a ga mellom beiteomradene og til a sta. Etter a ha blitt utsatt for forstyrrelser av jegere, samlet Knutshoreinen seg til storre grupper enn for jakten og sto mer vaktsomme. Hardangerviddareinen derimot, brukte den samme minimumstid til beiting, men gikk signifikant mer enn for jakten. Den brukte heller nesten ingen tid til a sta i ro. Hyppigheten av forstyrrelser var ikke signifikant forskjellig mellom de to grupper og deres bevegelses-hastighet etter forstyrrelse var den samme. Jegernes jaktsuksess i form av fellinger var ogsa den samme i de to omrader. Energiutgiftene, malt som relativt tap av kroppsvekt gjennom jaktsesongen, var hoyere for Hardangerviddareinen med darligere ernaeringsstatus i startfasen. For begge flokker var energiutgiftene hoyere sammenlignet med en mindre forstyrret reinflokk (Forelhogna). Vi tror at, selv om det a sta stille og vaktsomt i samlet flokk er risikofylt, sa er det enda mer risikofylt a bevege seg, noe som dog kan vaere mer lonnsomt, om de finner et bedre beiteomrade. Mer velfodd Knutshorein, som samlet seg og sto i ro, bevarte mer av sin allerede opplagrede naeringsenergi, noe som minimaliserer tidsforbruk til naeringssok og som er en risikoavvergende strategi.

Section 1. in the upper part of the river, is located above a waterfall impassable for migratory salmonids and is surrounded by grazing land. Sections 2 and 3, in the middle and lower parts of the river, are influenced by agricultural activity. Total nitrogen concentration varied between 250 and 1000 μg l −1 in section 1 and 1500 and 2500 μg l−1 in sections 2 and 3. Total phosphorus (Tot-P) concentrations also increased with decreasing altitude: 19–46 μg l−1 in section I and 31–101 μg l −1 in sections 2 and 3. The number of 0 + salmon in sections 2 and 3 varied between 30.1 and 167.8 specimens 100 m −2, with means 90.2 and 95.2 specimens 100 m −2:, respectively; the density of 1 + salmon, with mean values of 16.3 and 51.0 specimens 100m−2 was significantly correlated with the original fry density. The growth rate of 0+ salmon was not inversely related to cohort density, but was significantly so for 1 + salmon. Mean annual salmon production in section 2 was 1595 g 100 m−2 year 1, and in section 3 was 841 g 100m−2 year 1. A logarithmic function gave the best curve fit between salmon production and mean annual biomass. Thus, production levelled off for the highest values recorded in section 2, and perhaps approached the carrying capacity of the stream. A multiple regression analysis showed that yearly variation in 1 + salmon density was the single factor accounting for most of the total variability in production (60%). Variation in water temperature and nutrient content were not significantly related to variation in fish production. Densities of brown trout were low in all sections (<20 specimens 100m −2).

Feeding birds selected the low herb willow scrub vegetation community and to a lesser degree eutrophic fen. Birds did not selectively feed on eutrophic dwarf birch/juniper heath despite it being the third most used vegetation community by virtue of its extent. Although soil penetrability, vegetation cover and earthworm density varied across vegetation communities, Great Snipe selected sites with similar habitat characteristics in different vegetation communities. Great Snipe seemed to select for an optimal combination of soil penetrability and earthworm density, and for medium scrub cover. Nests were found in a broad range of vegetation communities, but only low herb willow scrub was selectively used. However, an equal number of nests was found in eutrophic fen due to its larger extent. Dense vegetation cover around nests and short flushing distance of incubating females indicate low sensitivity to disturbance. We consider the Great Snipe to be a food and habitat specialist, requiring habitats rich in sub-surface invertebrates to breed. This may explain its scattered distribution in Scandinavia, and may render it vulnerable to habitat modification and loss.","PLUVIALIS-APRICARIA and PREDATION-RISK and TRADE-OFF and EFFICIENCY and WOODCOCK and BEHAVIOR and Breeding and Ecosystem","10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07227.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1992.tb07227.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Wetlands/peatlands, Mountains","Observational studies"

However, some species such as epiphytic lichens may be vulnerable to fire. We studied the effects of fire on epiphytic lichens on living and dead Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) by surveying lichens up to two meters on the trunks 21 years after experimental and replicated prescribed burnings in pine-dominated boreal forests in Finland. We investigated three types of stands that had faced different levels of fire severity: 1) unburned semi-natural mature stands (i.e., control sites), 2) burned semi-natural mature stands, and 3) burned retention groups on clearcut sites. In the semi-natural mature stands, the fires were low-severity surface fires and induced negligible mortality in P. sylvestris. In the retention groups, the fires induced high tree mortality and made fresh deadwood the dominant substrate type. Low-severity fires reduced the occurrence of several species, but usually did not eliminate them. High-severity fires eliminated some species, but the abundant deadwood frequently hosted some species that were absent or infrequent on the unburned sites. Thus, the fires had only small effects on total species richness. However, fires substantially changed species composition: they reduced the occurrence of species associated with late-successional habitats, while increasing the occurrence of early-successional species. We also found fires to decrease the occurrence of microlichens and increase that of macrolichens. The magnitude of the compositional changes increased with fire severity. Our findings indicate that the high quantities of fresh deadwood in post-disturbance forests provide habitat only to a limited portion of deadwood-associated lichens. Fire can increase landscape-scale variation in epiphytic lichen communities, but we observed negative effects, which increased with fire severity, on lichen flora of conservation concern.

To reach zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 in Sweden, new efficient methods of biomass extraction, such as geometrical biomass thinnings, are being explored and tested. These machine-based methods involve the extraction of above-ground biomass in narrow, 1-2 m-wide strips between extraction racks. While evidence-based optimization of biomass extraction mostly focuses on time- and cost-efficiency and on stand growth, criteria such as tree diversity are often overlooked. However, with ongoing climate change, tree diversity is crucial to strengthening the resilience and productivity of future forests, which also enhance the provision of ecosystem services and overall biological diversity. Therefore, we studied the effects of different biomass thinning strategies on spatial tree diversity in southern Sweden using nearest-neighbour summary statistics. We found scientific evidence that different geometrical designs of biomass thinning, especially in 1 or 2 m-wide strips, resulted in higher spatial tree diversity compared to conventional biomass thinning. Hence, in mixed conifer-broadleaved forests, biomass thinning in 1 or 2 m-wide strips is recommended for maintaining spatial tree diversity.","biomass and geometrical thinning and boom-corridor and species mingling and spatial tree diversity and SCOTS PINE and MANAGEMENT and PRODUCTIVITY and BIODIVERSITY and SIMULATION and TEMPERATE","10.1139/cjfr-2023-0146","https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2023-0146",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

To maintain the biodiversity of hay meadows, it is important to understand local management regimes and the land use history that has shaped them and their biodiversity. There is however a general erosion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), related to hay meadows and other semi-natural habitats. This review aims to examine historical and written sources of land use practices related to hay meadows and to discuss the implications of a reintroduction of TEK in present and future management practices. Traditional land use practices and TEK obtained from written sources from four Norwegian regions and for the country as a whole are compared with present management practices. Written sources show that hay meadows have been managed in a complex but flexible way. Today's management regimes of hay meadows in Norway are streamlined and strongly simplified, most often involving only one late mowing and in some cases grazing. This simplification may result in loss of biodiversity. The potential to include more variety of management practices in hay meadows, by utilizing knowledge from written sources more systematically in combination with farmers' experienced knowledge (TEK) should be better utilized. Such an approach may secure both the biodiversity in hay meadows and TEK for the future. Former and present landscape ecological contexts in the infield-outlying land system show that management should be done for larger landscapes rather than small, isolated hay meadows, to optimize biodiversity conservation. For this study, we conducted a Norwegian literature review, based on ethnographical and ethnobotanical sources, as well as historical and present agricultural statistics, historical maps, results from research projects, and other sources. Our findings are discussed with similar European studies focusing on the historical management of hay meadows.","Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Management practices and Biodiversity and Land use and Semi-natural grassland and History and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE and CENTRAL-EUROPE and GRASSLAND and MANAGEMENT and LANDSCAPE and HISTORY and DIVERSITY and SWEDISH and HETEROGENEITY and Norway and Learning","10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126510","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126510",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

So far, 90% of the restoration effort has been on peatland restoration, with about 140 mires restored so far. There are three main restoration goals stated in the action plan: 1) limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, 2) climate adaptation and 3) improved ecological condition. Quantifying the outcome of the restoration actions is necessary to evaluate whether the goals of the action plan are met. A vegetation monitoring protocol was suggested before restoration started and has been implemented at five restoration sites. As the peatland restoration effort in Norway is increasing, it is timely to evaluate if the data currently collected can measure peatland restoration outcome. We evaluate the monitoring protocol based on statistical analyses of the data collected at two sites, describe how indicator species can be identified using generalized composition data used as the basis for classifying habitats in Norway (EcoSyst framework), and suggest the way forward for peatland restoration monitoring in Norway. Data collected according to the monitoring protocol can document changes in species composition at restoration sites, but has limitations when the ecological complexity at the sites increases and reference sites are unavailable. We argue that adjusting the monitoring protocol will: 1) facilitate alignment with existing peatland research; 2) connect better with monitoring programs where data is collected applying EcoSyst framework principles; and 3) enable upscaling to cover the wide variation emerging in peatland restoration. © 2024 The Authors.

Such removal, however, may affect a range of ecosystem functions and consequently also the ecosystem services that benefit society. We studied five cases: River Otra (Norway), River Spree (Germany), Lake Kemnade (Germany), Lake Grand-Lieu (France) and Hartbeespoort Dam (South Africa). In all, nuisance aquatic plant growth is managed, but dominant species, geographic setting and major societal uses are different. We quantified 12 final ecosystem services as flows per area and year in biophysical and monetary terms. Quantified services were food and fodder production, commercial fisheries, hunting and gathering wild products, hydropower production, drinking and irrigation water production, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, active and passive recreation and biodiversity conservation (nonuse). These services were related to aquatic plant cover via a range of ecosystem functions, and the effects were estimated of three plant removal regimes on the relative importance of the quantified ecosystem services and on the total sum of the monetary estimates (total economic value, TEV). The three removal regimes were ‘maximum removal’, ‘current practice’ and ‘do nothing’. In all five cases, TEV was dominated by different forms of recreation. TEV was highest for Lake Kemnade, where visitor densities were highest. TEV was most sensitive to the different management regimes in Lake Kemnade, because a threshold in aesthetic appreciation was passed in the ‘do-nothing’ regime, and in Hartbeespoort Dam, because of the effect on boating and angling. In the other cases, the different removal regimes had little effect on the estimated TEV. Synthesis and applications. Since recreation dominated the estimated societal benefits in the studied ecosystems, also where provision of hydropower, drinking water or irrigation water were relevant, effects on recreation should be a core consideration in the management of nuisance aquatic plants. Furthermore, aquatic plant management strategies will benefit from taking into account the differences in perceived nuisance among different categories of recreative users before engaging in costly removal. © 2023 The Authors.

Classification of ecological status and identifying the stressors impacting aquatic habitats is essential for achieving this aim. Here, we evaluate different methods and indices for assessing ecological status in a hydropower-regulated river in central Norway using kick-sampling and macroinvertebrate identification through morphology and DNA as well as using environmental DNA. In Norway, the ASPT index (Average Score Per Taxon) is commonly used to evaluate ecological condition in general, although the index only provides evidence for organic pollution. We observed lower than expected diversity in the regulated river, but this was not reflected in the ASPT index, which showed “Good” to “High” status for all samples and methods. An alternative index, the IBIBI (Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index), returned “Bad” to “Moderate” status using the same data. The DNA-based identification methods returned in general higher species richness and somewhat higher index values than morphological species identification did. Our study exemplifies the importance of including relevant biological quality indices in WFD compliant assessments, and we advocate inclusion of a pressure-independent index like IBIBI in Norwegian river management and DNA-based identification methods for future river management in general. © 2024, The Author(s).","Benthic macroinvertebrates and Community composition and DNA metabarcoding and eDNA and River management","10.1007/s10750-023-05448-4","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05448-4",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Over 16,000 km of rivers and lakes were available to sea trout in these watercourses, spanning from the temperate to Arctic regions. Sea trout were classified to be in a good or very good state in fewer than 25% of the watercourses and in a poor or very poor state in almost 40%. Twenty-nine watercourses had lost their sea trout populations. Salmon lice from aquaculture salmon farms had by far the largest adverse effect on sea trout among the human impact factors, both in the number of watercourses (83%) and river area affected (60%), and the total effect on sea trout abundance. Agriculture and hydropower production also had strong adverse impacts (35% and 19% of watercourses), but substantially lower than that caused by salmon lice. Culverts related to road crossings and other habitat alterations also had impacts on sea trout in many watercourses (27%). Exploitation of sea trout has been reduced in Norway in recent years, both in the marine and freshwater fisheries. Yet, the exploitation pressure was moderate or high in almost 14% of the watercourses where the state of sea trout was poor or very poor, suggesting a high potential for overexploitation in these. The state of sea trout was best in the northern sparsely populated areas. However, distribution of watercourses with sea trout in a poor or very poor state was more linked to aquaculture, agriculture, and hydropower production than human population density. The developed approach for large-scale mapping of state and pressures, which is vital for prioritizing management measures, may inspire other nations in their conservation effort for this important species. © 2024 The Authors.

A major challenge in biodiversity conservation is to facilitate viable populations of large apex predators in ecosystems where they were recently driven to ecological extinction due to resource conflict with humans. 2. Monetary compensation for losses of livestock due to predation is currently a key instrument to encourage human-carnivore coexistence. However, a lack of quantitative estimates of livestock losses due to predation leads to disagreement over the practice of compensation payments. This disagreement sustains the human-carnivore conflict. 3. The level of depredation on year-round, free-ranging, semi-domestic reindeer by large carnivores in Fennoscandia has been widely debated over several decades. In Norway, the reindeer herders claim that lynx and wolverine cause losses of tens of thousands of animals annually and cause negative population growth in herds. Conversely, previous research has suggested that monetary predator compensation can result in positive population growth in the husbandry, with cascading negative effects of high grazer densities on the biodiversity in tundra ecosystems. 4. We utilized a long-term, large-scale data set to estimate the relative importance of lynx and wolverine predation and density-dependent and climatic food limitation on claims for losses, recruitment and population growth rates in Norwegian reindeer husbandry. 5. Claims of losses increased with increasing predator densities, but with no detectable effect on population growth rates. Density-dependent and climatic effects on claims of losses, recruitment and population growth rates were much stronger than the effects of variation in lynx and wolverine densities. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis provides a quantitative basis for predator compensation and estimation of the costs of reintroducing lynx and wolverine in areas with free-ranging semi-domestic reindeer.

Gene flow is a result of both landscape connectivity and demographic processes determining the number of dispersing individuals in space and time. Thus, the effect of human impact on processes determining the level of genetic diversity must be interpreted in the context of basic ecological conditions affecting survival and recruitment. When the intensity of human impact and habitat suitability correlate, the effect on genetic diversity and gene flow may be challenging to predict. We compared genetic diversity, gene flow and landscape resistance in two contrasting landscapes in Norway for the pond-breeding amphibian Triturus cristatus: a highly human-impacted, agricultural landscape with ecologically productive habitats, and a forested landscape with less productive habitats and lower levels of human impact. Our results show that genetic diversity was higher and gene flow lower within the forested landscape. Microclimatic moisture conditions and vegetation cover were important determinants of landscape resistance to gene flow within both landscapes. There were indications that landscape resistance was increased by minor roads in the forested landscape, which was not the case for the agricultural landscape, suggesting a higher vulnerability to human interference within the landscape matrix for the populations in less productive habitats. Our findings suggest that the effect of human impact on genetic diversity may not be straightforward but modulated by the ecological conditions underlying local demographic processes. Populations within both landscapes seem to be vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity, but due to different mechanisms. This has implications for the choice of relevant management actions, that is, increasing population stability may be more relevant within an agricultural landscape still permeable for dispersal, while conserving dispersal corridors may be more appropriate in the forested landscape, to avoid isolation and increased genetic drift. © 2023 The Authors.

Species richness of plants generally decreases along elevational gradients or peaks at intermediate elevations. Land use including grazing by wild and domestic herbivores also affects plant communities and diversity, but how grazing affects plant diversity along elevational gradients is less clear. 2. Using a field experiment along an elevational gradient in Norway, we tested whether the impact of grazing on plant diversity interacts with elevation. Vascular plant communities were sampled following 10years of experimental sheep grazing (decreased/ceased, maintained and increased densities of 0, 25 and 80sheepkm(-2)) and compared with pre-experimental baseline data. 3. The impact of grazing on species richness (alpha diversity) was investigated at the species level, and temporal community variance was used to investigate community stability (temporal beta diversity). Spatial community variance (spatial beta diversity) at the enclosure level was used to test whether community homogenization differed between treatments. 4. Species richness and temporal stability varied between treatments and along the elevational gradient. Where grazing was ceased, species richness declined by up 3.7 species at low elevations and increased by up to 3.5 species at high elevations, whilst where grazing was maintained or increased, changes were less extreme along the elevational gradient. 5. Temporal stability of plant communities was highest at low elevations and lowest at high elevations where grazing was reduced. There were no clear differences in spatial homogenization between grazing treatments, although spatial species turnover increased in heathlands where grazing decreased. 6. Synthesis. This study shows that the effect of grazing on plant diversity varies with elevation, and grazing herbivores can thus directly affect elevational patterns of plant diversity.

Forests that have never been clear-cut and have old growth characteristics, termed ""near-natural,"" often harbor different and richer species assemblages than managed forests. Alternative management strategies may be able to balance the needs of biodiversity with the demands of forestry, but evaluation efforts are limited by the challenges of measuring biodiversity. Species richness is frequently used as a simple measure of biodiversity, but research indicates that it may not adequately capture community-level changes. Alternatively, trait-based measures of biodiversity may prove to be useful, but research is lacking. In this paper, we use a large dataset that includes 339 obligate saproxylic beetle species collected over a decade in the boreal region throughout southern Norway to: (1) establish if there is a difference in beetle community composition between near-natural and managed forests; and (2) determine which measures of beetle biodiversity best indicate forest naturalness. We arranged the sites in an ordination space and tested for differences in community composition between these forest types. We also tested different measures of biodiversity to determine which were the most predictive of forest naturalness. We found a clear difference in community composition between near-natural and managed forests. Additionally, three measures of biodiversity were most predictive of forest naturalness: proportional abundance of predators, community weighted mean (CWM) of wing length, and CWM of body roundness. The probability that a forest was near-natural increased with the proportional abundance of predators but decreased with CWM wing length and body roundness. Although species richness was higher in near-natural forests, the effect was not significant. Overall, our findings underscore the conservation value of near-natural forests and highlight the potential of several measures of biodiversity for determining forest quality.

In this study, we combined four complete years of nationwide data collected during a long-term camera trap (CT) monitoring program in Norway. We employed a multi-scale occupancy model to investigate the relationship of pine marten occurrence to clearcuts (regenerating stands & LE; 10 years old) and forests & GE; 120 years old. We also examined pine marten detection in relation to habitat features (i.e. dominant microsite characteristics) and to varying snow depths and temperatures.

At the habitat-patch scale, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with the presence of old forest patches and terrain ruggedness, but not with clearcuts & LE; 100 m from sites. At CT sites near clearcuts, the detection probability was negatively correlated with snow depth. In contrast, pine marten occurrence was positively associated with snow depth at CT sites > 100 m from clearcuts. Furthermore, the detection probability increased with temperature and the presence of boulders at CT sites. Boulders may provide important access points for foraging, and cover for resting and predator avoidance.

This may have negative consequences for biodiversity. Hitherto, most studies have compared species diversity between native and non-native forest stands, which makes it difficult to separate the impact of tree species per se from stand characteristics. Our study, conducted in the south of Sweden, compares saproxylic beetle diversity across different nutritional groups, in dead wood of two native and four non-native tree species in a block design after one and three seasons. Such an approach allows analysis of the impact of non-native tree species per se. Mean species richness (+/- SD) per log was lower in non-native than in native tree species (non-native trees: lodgepole pine: 10.7 (+/- 5.3); Sitka spruce: 8.5 (+/- 4.3), Douglas fir: 7.1 (+/- 4.3), Japanese larch 9.4 (+/- 4.6); native trees: Norway spruce: 12.0 (+/- 6.0), Scots pine: 12.3 (+/- 5.2)). Sample-based rarefaction revealed that when only native tree species were pooled, the species richness was higher than for all tree species combined. The difference in species composition among tree species was strongly driven by bark and wood consumers in the first season, while for predators and fungivores, the differences were smaller. Species composition differed most in the first season. Dissimilarity in beetle species composition was positively correlated with phylogenetic distances of the tree species. Species richness was lower in non-native tree species that are only remotely related to native trees species. Of the studied non-native tree species, lodgepole pine was more closely related to native tree species and consistently harboured higher species richness. Synthesis and applications. Although non-native tree species also harbour saproxylic beetle communities, the use of non-native tree species, especially those only remotely related to native tree species, reduces local diversity of saproxylic beetles. Thus, for biodiversity conservation, an extensive use of non-native tree species is not recommended as this increases the risk of losing forest biodiversity, especially when they are only distantly related to native tree species.","conifers and deadwood and exotic tree species and non-native and phylogeny and saproxylic beetles and species richness and xylophages and DOUGLAS-FIR and FOREST and BIODIVERSITY and INSECTS and HABITAT and PLANTATIONS and COMMUNITIES and MANAGEMENT and IMPACTS and Trees and Beetles","10.1111/1365-2664.14318","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14318",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. ‘passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce. © 2023 The Authors.

Reindeer pastures are exposed to the development of infrastructure, hydropower, mineral exploration, recreational cabin areas, and wind power. Land use conflicts are exacerbated under climate policy with wind power plants in reindeer herding areas. Projected developments and climate change impacts challenge the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders and the resilience of reindeer herding. Analysis of biodiversity loss by the GLOBIO3 model is suggested as tool for decision support, in consultation with Sámi reindeer owners, taking into account traditional knowledge of reindeer herding. GLOBIO3 analysis for Sámi reindeer herding land in Finnmark indicates that in 2011, compared to an intact situation, about 50% of the biodiversity of reindeer calving grounds has been lost, and it is expected to be reduced with another 10% in the scenario for 2030. Reindeer owners in Finnmark told that they expect biodiversity loss will have implications for the quality and extent of suitable grazing areas. Especially the quality of the calving grounds is essential for reindeer herding. An important lesson from dialogue with reindeer owners is that even highly impacted areas should not be considered as lost, and thus be opened to further development, as they are still important for seasonal reindeer migration and grazing at certain times of the year. The chapter presents research on methods development, traditional knowledge in the context of Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark and highlights innovative tools to engage rightsholders and stakeholders in the Arctic in development planning processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","GLOBIO3 model and Reindeer herding and Sámi traditional knowledge and Norway","10.1007/978-3-031-17625-8_9","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-17625-8_9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 ± 0.03; average ± standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 ± 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 ± 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 ± 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 ± 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 ± 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 ± 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW. © 2023 by the authors.","conservation and grassland and management and pollinators and spatial modeling and wild bees and Biodiversity and Decision making and Ecosystems and Forestry and Land use and Population distribution and Remote sensing and Dynamic world and Grassland and Grassland habitat and Land cover maps and Pollinator and Spatial modelling and Species distribution modeling and Species distributions and Species richness and Wild bee and Conservation","10.3390/rs15071749","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071749",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Studies disentangling the effects of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on species diversity are rare, however, understanding the differences between these effects is crucial for forest management and conservation efforts. Here, we investigated the influence of habitat quantity, quality, and continuity on the total and red-listed species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) forest in Central Europe. The fruitbody-based mycological survey conducted on permanent plots was combined with the measurements of forest structural characteristics such as deadwood volumes (indicating habitat quantity), dimensions, and decay stages (indicating habitat quality). Additionally, precise dendrochronological measurements were used to estimate the mean age of five oldest trees and the number of >250 years-old-trees (i.e., those that survived a probable logging activity about 250 years ago) as indicators of habitat continuity. Our results showed the total species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi to be best correlated with habitat quantity (volume of low snags and lying deadwood), while the red-listed species richness was best explained by habitat continuity indicated by the number of >250 years-old-trees. Our study provides novel evidence regarding uninterrupted habitat continuity being crucial in supporting red-listed fungal species. Stands with preserved habitat continuity (e.g., the absence of clearcutting and deforestation) as well as old-growth stands with long habitat history should be prioritised for conservation. Greater degree of retention forestry practices should be required in production forests to preserve habitat continuity. Our study shows that such decisions are likely to lead to positive effects that can persist for centuries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Biological legacy and Coarse woody debris and Habitat amount and Habitat loss and Mountain spruce forest and Saproxylic biodiversity and Biodiversity and Conservation and Deforestation and Ecosystems and Fungi and Growth and Trees and Weight and Central Department and Central Europe and Europe and Norway and Landforms and Biological legacies and Habitat continuity and Mountain spruce forests and Saproxylic and Species richness and Wood-inhabiting fungi and biodiversity and coarse woody debris and forest management and habitat and habitat loss and saproxylic organism and species richness","10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121055","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121055",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, few studies have explored how long-lasting this effect is and how it affects saproxylic beetles. Ten years after cutting, we investigated effects of different release cutting levels (high, medium, and no release) around 140-year-old retained oaks in a commercial forest with Norway spruce (Picea abies). We evaluated oak vitality using crown and dead wood measurements. Saproxylic beetles were caught in window traps, identified to species level, and grouped according to their association with oak and/or Norway spruce. Released oaks had more light, higher temperatures, greater crown growth, and less dead wood in the crown compared to the no-release control. After 10 years we still found a higher abundance of oak-associated beetles and higher overall species richness of saproxylic beetles in the released oaks. Beetle species composition significantly differed between released oaks and control. We suggest avoiding planting trees beneath retained oaks when regenerating conifer forests and to proceed with conservation management during subsequent thinning by removing regeneration under the oak crowns. We emphasize the benefits of monitoring the retained oaks to maintain tree vitality, habitat quality, and insolation. © 2023 The Authors.

However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to cost-effectively restore such forests. This study reports the influence of vicinity (distance) of forest type (mixed or spruce), fencing and mechanical site preparation (MSP) on the early performance of planted beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedlings and natural regeneration of other tree species following clear-cuts of Norway spruce in southern Sweden. After 6 years, we found clear effects of fencing and MSP, but not of vicinity of forest type. Fencing had a positive effect on height growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) but not on height of planted beech and naturally regenerated birch (Betula pendula, B. pubescens). There was a positive effect of MSP on survival and height growth of planted beech, and on the amount of natural regeneration of Scots pine. We conclude that establishment of beech forest is greatly accelerated by active regeneration approaches such as planting. In addition, the combination of planting beech, natural regeneration of other species, fencing and MSP is effective to promote the transition to mixed and diverse stands with both broadleaves and conifers. Fencing represented the highest cost among the treatments, and its cost-effectiveness depends on the local ungulate browsing pressure. In our study, fencing was critical to protect natural regeneration of Scots pine from browsing. Finally, natural regeneration of birch was abundant in our study and relatively unaffected by fencing and MSP treatments. With time, pre-commercial thinning of the naturally regenerated birch will be needed to maintain a diverse mixture of tree species. © 2023, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation and Cost-efficient restoration and Rehabilitation and Resilience and Ungulate browsing and Sweden and broad-leaved forest and browsing and clearcutting and climate change and coniferous tree and growth response and mixed forest and pine and regeneration and resilience and restoration ecology and ungulate and Norway and Regeneration and Trees","10.1007/s10342-023-01554-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-023-01554-z",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Polypores (wood-inhabiting fungi) are key decomposers of dead wood, but, due to a lack of coarse woody debris (CWD) in forest ecosystems, many species are under threat. Here, we study the long-term effects on polypore diversity of two restoration treatments: creating CWD by felling whole trees and prescribed burning. This large-scale experiment is located in spruce-dominated boreal forests in southern Finland. The experiment has a factorial design (n = 3) including three levels of created CWD (5, 30, and 60 m3 ha−1) crossed with burning or no burning. In 2018, 16 years after launching the experiment, we inventoried polypores on 10 experimentally cut logs and 10 naturally fallen logs per stand. We found that overall polypore community composition differed between burned and unburned stands. However, only red-listed species abundances and richness were positively affected by prescribed burning. We found no effects of CWD levels created mechanically by felling of trees. We show, for the first time, that prescribed burning is an effective measure for restoring polypore diversity in a late-successional Norway spruce forest. Burning creates CWD with certain characteristics that differ from what is created by CWD restoration by felling trees. Prescribed burning promotes primarily red-listed species, demonstrating its effectiveness as a restoration measure to promote diversity of threatened polypore species in boreal forests. However, because the CWD that the burning creates will decrease over time, to be functional, prescribed burns need to be applied regularly on the landscape scale. Large-scale and long-term experimental studies, such as this one, are invaluable for establishing evidence-based restoration strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

Rotational prescribed burning increases landscape heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of different regeneration stages of heather. Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) responses to fire in traditionally managed coastal heathland have already been studied, but less is known about other beetle groups in this system. We compared the beetle activity between patches of mature and recently burnt heath, by looking at diversity indices, species composition and ecological preferences and traits. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find an increase in beta diversity after disturbance, but we found that prescribed burning offers micro-environmental conditions which enhanced the activity of sun-loving and xerophilous species. We also identified new indicator species for both mature and pioneer heath in five beetle families: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, Leiodidae, and Scirtidae. Rotational prescribed burning was confirmed to be an efficient conservation tool for specialists without affecting the overall diversity of the site. We recommend the use of several taxa, ecological preferences and traits to assess the impact of prescribed burning and to monitor the condition of traditionally managed coastal heathlands. © 2023, The Author(s).","European semi-natural habitats and Ground-dwelling arthropods and Low-intensity grazing and Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and Postfire assemblages and Norway and beetle and community structure and environmental conditions and grazing and grazing pressure and heathland and prescribed burning and species diversity and Burns","10.1007/s10531-023-02684-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-023-02684-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

We show that key European timber-producing countries – Finland, Sweden, Germany (Bavaria) – cannot fulfil the increased harvest demands linked to the ambitious 1.5°C target.

Ecological restoration is acknowledged as an important tool to counteract this negative trend. The semi-natural calcareous sand dune meadows in south-western Norway are known for their high species diversity, much like similar habitats of high conservation value across Europe today. The recent cessation of grazing has caused a decline in several endangered species associated with these habitats due to the advancement of secondary succession. We conducted a long-term restoration experiment in semi-natural dune meadows over 16 years to examine if current trends in biodiversity loss could be reversed and at what time-scale restoration measures take effect. Three treatments were applied; mowing annually, mowing bi-annually, and a control (no mowing). In fields mown annually species richness increased significantly over time. However, the response was slow and significant effects were first seen after year 10. Fields mown bi-annually also showed a similar trend but the response was more variable. Several characteristic meadow species were favoured by annual mowing while they declined in the control fields. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a compositional shift, indicating the re-arrangement/-establishment of typical meadow vegetation in the mown sites, contrasting the further successional development in the control. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term data in supporting good evidence-based management. Annual mowing is effectively restoring this unique habitat, but restoration efforts need to be sustained over many years to show positive effects.","cessation of grazing and coastal sand dune meadows and long-term experiment and plant species richness and ecological restoration and semi-natural grasslands and PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS and LAND-USE HISTORY and SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS and AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE and DUNE VEGETATION and RESTORATION and MANAGEMENT and DIVERSITY and IMPACT and FRAGMENTATION","10.3112/erdkunde.2017.02.03     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2017.02.03",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Our study area covers south-eastern Norway and contains 16 agricultural landscapes with 2162 patches. To analyse regularity a local linear mixed model (LLMM) was applied. This procedure estimates the richness trends due to shared effects of size and shape, and simultaneously provides the landscape-specific random effect. The latter is a direct estimate of the degree of irregularity between the landscapes, conditioned on specific values of size and shape. The results show a positive interaction between the shape and size of patches, which is repeated for all landscapes. The shape of the patches produces more regular patterns in species richness than the size of patches. This we attribute to effects of dispersal and distance to neighbouring patches of different environmentally conditioned species pools. Large and complex patches have shorter average distance to neighbouring patches (of different types) than large simple-shaped (circular) patches have. We attribute the higher species richness of the former, given a similar area, to a higher number of species dispersed from the outside into the more complex plot. For small patches, however, the distance to the edge is short relative to normal dispersal distances, for patches of all shapes. This explains why the positive effect of shape complexity on species richness is stronger for large patches. This interpretation is supported by a strong spatial correlation conditioned on the most complex patches. Theories of dynamics in biodiversity in patchy landscapes must consider shape as a regulator at the same level as size, and both shape and size of patches should be simultaneously taken into account for management planning.","AREA and PATTERNS and SCALE and PRODUCTIVITY and DIVERSITY and ENERGY and WATER and TREE","10.1111/ju.2007.0906-7590.04989     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/ju.2007.0906-7590.04989",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In its wake, conflicts arise over land use changes converting pristine nature into industrial power plants and its associated adverse biodiversity effects, crowned by one of the most obvious and deadly consequences: bird collisions. Most post-construction studies report low levels of avian mortality, but the majority of these studies are conducted primarily on larger birds. However, the diversity and abundance of small passerine birds are rarely reflected in the carcass surveys, although they in numeric proportion to their abundances should be the most numerous. The assumption that surveys find all carcasses seems thus rarely fulfilled and passerine mortality is likely to be grossly underestimated. We therefore designed an experiment with dummy birds to estimate mortality of small-bodied passerines and other small-bodied birds during post-construction surveys, tested in a medium-sized wind farm in western Norway. The wind farm was surveyed weekly during the migration periods by carcass survey teams using trained dogs to find killed birds. The dogs in the carcass surveys were more successful in locating the large than the small dummy birds (60–200 g), where they found 74% of the large dummy birds. Detecting the smaller category (5–24 g) was more demanding and the dogs only found 17% of the small dummy birds. Correcting the post-construction carcass survey outcome with the results from the experiment leads to an almost fourfold increase in estimated mortality rates, largely due to the low detection rate of the smallest category. The detection rates will naturally vary between wind farms, depending on the specific habitat characteristics, the efficiency of the carcass surveys and the search intervals. Thus, implementing a simple experiment with dummy birds to future post-construction surveys will produce more accurate estimates of the wind turbine mortality rates, and thus improve our understanding of the biodiversity effects of conforming to a more sustainable future. © 2023, The Author(s).","Animals and Dogs and Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions and Energy-Generating Resources and Passeriformes and Power Plants and Renewable Energy and Wind and adverse drug reaction and animal and dog and electric power plant and energy resource and renewable energy and wind","10.1038/s41598-023-46909-z","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46909-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Here we consider the potential implications of shortened rotation times for biodiversity in planted monocultures of the two most common production tree species in Sweden, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). To do so we surveyed bird, bryophyte, epiphytic lichen and vascular plant diversity in 80 and 55-year-old stands; stand ages which approximate present-day and potential future rotation lengths in this region respectively. We found clear differences in the species communities of the 55 compared to the 80-year-old stands for both understory species and epiphytes, but not for birds. Nevertheless, bird species richness was still highest in the 80-year-old Norway spruce dominated stands. Dead wood amount was also highest the 80-year-old Norway spruce stands. Highest species richness of epiphytic lichens was found in 80-year-old Scots pine stands. However, 55-year-old Scots pine stands had a higher understory species richness and diversity than the older Scots pine stands, including a larger number of open land species. The 80-year-old forest stands examined may be considered old with respect to production forest rotation lengths in Sweden but are relatively young when comparing stand ages of unmanaged natural forest stands. Nevertheless, our results indicate that shortening the rotation time of Scots pine and Norway spruce, in this part of Sweden from 80 to 55 years, could have important consequences for forest biodiversity. These consequences are primarily inferred from the likely implications from shortened rotations for lichens community composition and diversity in both Norway spruce and Scots pine stands, as well as impacts on understory plant species in Norway spruce stands. © 2023 Petersson et al.

Specifically, we estimate that the construction of hydropower reservoirs in south Norway caused a loss of ca. 222 km<sup>2</sup> of functional habitat for wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)-which is far larger than assumed based on land inundation indices (110 km<sup>2</sup>). Fully mitigating these impacts is challenging: scenario analyses reveal that the measures proposed by societal actors would yield only a fraction of the habitat lost (2-12 km<sup>2</sup>) and could cause trade-off risks with other SDGs.

These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant–herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species. However, wolf territory presence had negative effects on browsing occurrence and pressure when interacting with secondary roads, young forest, or snow cover.

As a by-product of the exploitation of hydroelectricity, surplus masses from tunnel excavations are deposited as spoil heaps in the alpine landscape. The typical management goal for such spoil heaps is that their species composition converges towards that of their undisturbed surroundings. At present we lack knowledge of the rate as well as the direction of these successions. We examined the species composition of five alpine spoil heaps in western Norway at two points in time, after 6-16, and 24-34 years of succession, with regard to vegetation cover, species richness, species composition and soil conditions. We also compared the vegetation of spoil heaps with that of their surroundings. After ca. 30 years, bryophyte and lichen cover and species richness were similar to those of their surroundings, while cover of vascular plants and species richness recovered more slowly. The vegetation development of spoil heaps appears safe-site limited rather than dispersal limited. Topsoil development was slow, but some accumulation of organic matter was observed. The species composition followed a successional trajectory in direction of the vegetation of the surroundings. Estimated linear successional rates indicate that 35-48 years are needed from construction of spoil heaps till a species composition more or less similar to their surroundings has been reached. However, these estimates are likely to be over-optimistic because successional rates tend to decrease with time. Based on our results we propose three changes to the current spoil-heap construction practice that will improve their restoration: (1) to increase surface unevenness, by which the number of safe sites will increase and germination and establishment success will be enhanced; (2) to increase substrate variability, by adding more of fine-grained materials more species will establish in shorter time; and (3) to use seed from local sources or to let the spoil heaps regenerate naturally.

Several studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found.

Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55% was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56% black grouse habitats and 16% willow ptarmigan habitats. 3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90%, 47% and 9% of the annual hunting harvest of these species. 4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.

In this study, we assessed soil health by soil texture class on arable land in Southeast Norway and mid-Norway and between grassland and arable land in mid-Norway. We used descriptive statistics and the Welch t-test with unequal variance and Bonferroni corrections to compare a physical soil indicator (bulk density) and chemical indicators (organic matter, P-AL, K-AL, Ca-AL, Mg-AL, Na-AL and pH). We developed scoring curves from cumulative normal distribution functions on regional soil data for various soil indicators where climate, soil texture class and land use were considered. Our results show that for certain soil texture classes, average soil indicator values differed between pedo-climatic zones on arable land, but for others the difference was not significant. The variability between the pedo-climatic zones for these can be neglected, but for the ones that differ, the variability is important to consider when assessing soil health. Similarly, this was the case when comparing land use (grassland and arable land) for most soil indicators in mid-Norway. This finding illustrates the importance of addressing unique local conditions in soil health assessments. We propose aggregating similar soil texture classes where no differences are apparent when developing scoring curves. The sub-optimal levels of plant available nutrients (P-AL and K-AL) found in the soil in both pedo-climatic zones highlights the importance of suitable threshold values for targeted soil ecosystem services to ensure soil health and sustainable agricultural production. We also recommend prioritizing the most relevant soil ecosystem services to limit the number of soil indicators that need monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris. In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns. We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.",NA,"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120842","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.120842",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

The complex pattern of habitat types created in forestry systems is ideal for analyses through the theoretical framework of alpha (local), gamma (total) and beta (compositional) diversity. Here I use saproxylic beetles, a species-rich threatened group, to compare four Norway spruce-dominated habitats representative of the boreal forest landscape of northern Europe: unmanaged semi-natural stands, nature reserves, unthinned middle-aged production stands and commercially thinned production stands. The beetles (in total 38 085 individuals of 312 species), including red-listed ones and three feeding guilds (wood consumers, fungivores and predators) were studied in 53 stands in central-southern Sweden, in two regions with differing amounts of conservation forest. Alpha diversity of saproxylic, but not red-listed, beetles was higher in the thinned stands than in the semi-natural stands, and did not differ for the other forest types. Beta diversity of saproxylic beetles was higher in unmanaged semi-natural stands than in the other forest types, but species composition did not differ noticeably. Furthermore, red-listed saproxylic beetles had higher gamma diversity in unmanaged semi-natural stands in the region with more conservation forest, but not in the one with less such forest. The local factors dead wood volume and dead wood diversity did not influence alpha diversity of beetles, but increasing canopy openness had a minor negative influence on saproxylic and red-listed beetles. While the local scale (alpha diversity) indicates the potential for managed forests to house many saproxylic beetle species associated with spruce forests in this boreal landscape, the larger scales (beta and gamma diversity) indicate the value of unmanaged forests for the conservation of the entire saproxylic beetle fauna. These results show the importance of analyses at multiple levels of diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) for identifying patterns relevant to conservation. © 2022 Oskar Gran.

However, wind farm construction and infrastructure might cause other problems, for example, reducing biodiversity. In parts of their distribution area, eagle owls are scarce and declining, and not much is known about their tolerance for different kind of disturbances. Here, we investigated the presence-absence of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in 48 territories in the central part of Norway before the construction of eight wind farms and power lines started, and shortly after the construction period. Eagle owls living within 4-5 km away from the disturbance left their territories to a higher extent than eagle owls living even further away. Wind power is useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the construction and operation might have negative effects on biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of wind farm and power line construction on territory occupancy in the vulnerable Eurasian eagle owl. We investigated 48 eagle owl territories before and after the whole construction period and a short operation period with the use of sound meters. We found that territorial eagle owls within 4-5 km from the wind farm and power line construction disturbance left their territories to a significantly higher extent (41% reduction in the number of territories with eagle owls) compared with the eagle owls in territories further away (23% reduction). The distance from the nest site to the disturbance was significantly shorter for those territories that were abandoned compared with territories where the birds stayed. Possible reasons for this decline might be a higher mortality caused by collisions, desertion and avoidance of wind power areas caused by the noise and disturbance from their construction. In addition, there are possible indirect effects, for example reductions in prey species may force eagle owls to abandon their territories. The construction period lasted much longer than the period with active wind turbines and power lines in this investigation, but we cannot separate the effects of the two because the investigations were only possible in the eagle owl breeding season, and the wind turbines were activated shortly after the construction period. Our results imply that careful investigations are needed to detect the possible occurrence of eagle owls near any type of construction work. Studies of these territories should strongly influence how and when the construction work can be carried out, but more investigations are needed to find details about the influence of distance.","anthropogenic disturbance and birds and construction and influence area and territory and tolerance and turbines and wind energy and wind farm construction and BIRD POPULATIONS and BREEDING PERFORMANCE and SPOTTED OWLS and HOME-RANGE and BEHAVIOR and DENSITY and NOISE and CONSEQUENCES and DISPERSAL and MORTALITY","10.3390/ani12091089     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12091089",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line","Observational studies"

However, few studies control for the spatial arrangement of the trees within mixtures to determine the influence that clustering the tree species (patch scale mixtures), versus evenly dispersing them (intimate scale mixtures), may have for biodiversity and ES outcomes. To highlight the potential implications of altering tree spatial arrangement in mixtures, and the need to fill related knowledge gaps, here we provide a qualitative multi-disciplinary overview of ecological and socio-economic drivers with the potential to alter biodiversity, ecosystem services, and management-related outcomes from patch versus intimate scale mixtures. We focused our overview on even-aged mixtures of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula pendula or B. pubescens) in Sweden, which enabled us to contrast findings within a biogeographical and silvicultural setting. Specifically, we targeted implications for biodiversity (understory vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, saproxylic beetles, birds), biomass production, harvesting costs, management ease, recreation and aesthetics, cervid game, as well as abiotic and biotic risks (wind, fire, pathogens, pests, browsing damage). In the absence of direct empirical evidence, we primarily relied on expert inference from theory and relevant empirical studies sourced from the Fennoscandian region, and further afield if needed. Collectively these efforts allowed us to develop a number of informed hypotheses indicating that for spruce-birch mixtures in this region, patch scale mixtures may have the potential to favour the diversity of several forest dependant taxonomic groups, cervid game and reduce harvesting costs, whereas intimate mixtures may have the potential to reduce pathogen and pest damage, and likewise, potentially benefit production outcomes. Current knowledge was too limited, inconsistent or context dependant to even tentatively infer outcomes for fire risk, wind damage, browsing damage, management ease, recreational and aesthetic outcomes. We emphasize that our hypotheses require testing, but are sufficient to (1) highlight the likely importance of spatial-scale to biodiversity and ecosystem services outcomes in mixed-species production forests, (2) caution against generalization from mixture studies that lack scale considerations, and (3) motivate the targeted consideration of spatial grain in future mixture studies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biological diversity and Ecosystem services and Forestry and Mixed-forest stand and Species conservation and Tree plantations and Betula","10.1016/j.envc.2021.100407","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2021.100407",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

This issue is especially evident as wind parks have increasingly been developed inside Fennoscandian forests, against the advice of international bat conservation guidelines. In this study, we aimed to describe and explain bat community dynamics at a Norwegian wind park located in a boreal forest, especially to understand potential avoidance or attraction effects. The bat community was sampled acoustically and described using foraging guilds (short, medium, and long-range echolocators; SRE, MRE, LRE) as well as behavior (commuting, feeding and social calls). Sampling was undertaken at two locations per turbine: 1) the turbine pad and 2) a paired natural habitat at ground level, as well as from a meteorological tower. We used a recently developed method for camera trapping nocturnal flying insects synchronously with bat acoustic activity. Our results reveal trends in feeding and general bat activity across foraging guilds in relation to insect availability, habitat type, wind, temperature, and seasonality. We show how seasonal patterns in behavior across guilds were affected by habitat type, temperature, and wind. We found that SRE commuting and especially feeding activity was highest in natural habitats, whereas LRE overall activity at habitats more season dependent. We found that nocturnal insect availability was positively correlated with total bat feeding activity throughout the night. Our results provide evidence for both direct and indirect risks to bat communities by wind parks: SRE bat habitat is lost to wind energy infrastructure and LRE bat may have an increased risk of fatality. Our findings provide important insights on seasonal and spatial variability in bat activity, which can inform standardizing monitoring of bats acoustically in boreal forests, at wind parks, and in combination with non-invasive insect monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

"86","rayyan-674264627","Evolutionary predictions for a parasite metapopulation: Modelling salmon louse resistance to pest controls in aquaculture","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","Pests often evolve resistance to pest controls used in agriculture and aquaculture. The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control, the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level, pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous), how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated. Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk of resistance developing.","evolution model and integrated pest management and meta-population and pesticide resistance and sea lice and LICE LEPEOPHTHEIRUS-SALMONIS and ATLANTIC SALMON and SEA LICE and INSECT and SELECTION and SUSTAINABILITY and DISPERSAL and PRESSURE and CROP","10.1111/eva.13618","https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13618",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While bivalve farming usually occurs in highly productive coastal areas which already support numerous human activities and suffer from environmental pressures, numerical tools offer a promising avenue to explore and assess biomass production potential and associated ecosystemic impacts for further development of the industry and prospection of new exploitation sites. In this study, we coupled an ecophysiological model, the dynamic energy budget theory (DEB), with an ecosystem model (NORWECOM.E2E) to simulate blue mussel Mytilus spp. farming production and effects based on the food web in the mesotrophic Hardangerfjord in western Norway. We tested several levels of fjord-scale farming intensity and assessed 2 production purposes: aquafeed and human consumption. Results suggested the Hardangerfjord could host large-scale mussel farming for both purposes. However, large exploitation schemes displayed detrimental effects on individual mussel growth (39% less wet mass after 2 yr) and especially on secondary production (decrease of 33% after 1 yr) due to acute trophic competition. Simulations showed short production cycles for aquafeed were more efficient to exploit primary production, since young and small mussels have lower maintenance and reproduction costs. Dissolved nutrient inputs from salmonid farms had marginal effects on primary production (<2%).

There were five replications of each of the following categories: semi-natural forests, clearcuts, and managed forests (clearcut 70-120 years ago). Clearcutting seems to induce a long lasting effect on the Mycetophilidae fauna. The semi-natural forests were more species-rich and contained more 'potentially rare' species than the two other categories. Even though managed forests and clearcuts differed in faunal composition, their species richness was not significantly different. Continuity is probably a main factor for maintaining the diversity of Mycetophilidae species. Lumping the 15 sites together, the number of species was strongly correlated with the (temporal) continuity of tree cover and substrates, which may reflect an increased diversity of fungal habitats both in dead wood and on the ground. The degree of continuity was recognized by means of indicator species of fungi, lichen and vascular plants. The amount of dead wood was correlated with the species diversity, but was probably dependent on the continuity factor, since clearcuts with much dead wood had relatively fewer species. Important elements in a strategy for conservation of the diversity of mycetophilid species seem to be: (i) to identify and protect the remnant patches of forests with long continuity, (ii) as far as possible, to practice timber harvesting in earlier clearcut forests instead of semi-natural forests.

This preferred habitat constituted 24% of the study area. The proportion of avoided habitats was 30%, and the remaining 46% could be described as used but not preferred habitats. Given these proportions, the squirrels can be shown theoretically to be able to reach all preferred patches by moving across the used, although not preferred habitat patches, or within the preferred ones. Males had larger home ranges (mean 121.6 ha) than females (mean 23.0 ha). Mean daily movement was 430 m for males and 180 m for females; the maximum movement was 2800 m for males and 680 m for females. Most of the preferred habitat occurred in fragments larger than the area requirement of an individual squirrel, and even the most isolated fragments were within a trivial range for squirrels. Therefore, we predict that the random sample hypothesis will give a good prediction of the effects of forest fragmentation on the red squirrel in this landscape. However, if the proportion of avoided habitats increases, isolation and fragment size might affect the population density of red squirrels and the population size would be smaller than predicted from the random sample hypothesis.

This continuing process results in fragmentation and isolation of remaining habitats. Small and isolated populations may have reduced gene flow. This is a crucial factor for the structure and cohesiveness of populations. Gene flow in plant species is regulated by pollen and seed dispersal, and pollen dispersal is controlled by the species' mating system. As part of a research project on habitat fragmentation three meadow species (Dactylorhiza sambucina, Hypochoeris maculata, Polygala vulgaris) with different life strategies were therefore selected for studies of their mating systems. A hand pollination experiment showed that both Dactylorhiza sambucina and Polygala vulgaris were self-compatible. Seed set in H. maculata was low and the species may be considered as pseudo-self-compatible or self-incompatible. Using Bawa's (1974) criteria, however, also Hypochoeris maculata should be considered as self-compatible. All three species enhanced outbreeding but P. vulgaris also proved to be a good selfer and autogamous.","GENE FLOW and SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY and BREEDING SYSTEMS and BARTSIA-ALPINA and POPULATIONS and CONSEQUENCES and POLLINATION and STRATEGIES and PATERNITY and ECOLOGY","10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb00149.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb00149.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

A multiscaled study from a spruce forest in southern Norway","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","The diversity in different groups of obligate saproxylic beetles was related to ecological variables at three levels of spatial scale in mature spruce-dominated forest. The variables were connected to: (i) decaying wood, (ii) wood-inhabiting fungi, (iii) the level of disturbance, (iv) landscape ecology, and (v) vegetational structure. Several strong relationships were found at medium (1 km(2)) and large scales (4 km(2)), while only weak relationships were found at a small scale (0.16 ha; 1 ha = 10(4) m(2)). This may be explained by the local variations in habitat parameters and the high mobilities of many beetle species. Factors connected to decaying wood and wood-inhabiting fungi were clearly the most important factors at all scale levels. In particular, the variables diversity of dead tree parts, number of dead trees of large diameter and number of polypore fungi species increased the species richness of many groups and increased the abundance of many species. Eight species were absent below a certain density of decaying wood per 1 or 4 km(2). Former extensive cutting was a negative factor at large scale, probably because of decreasing recolonization with increasing distance to the source habitats. Thinning reduced the diversity of species associated with birch. The development of guidelines favouring the diversity of saproxylic beetles are discussed below.

Maintaining the health of forests was regarded the most important objective of forest management. Also forest landowners found that aspect most valuable in the management of their own forests. Wood production and employment got surprisingly low priority compared with other modes of use and values of forests. The results demonstrate the multiple-use nature of the utilization of forests in Finland. Although biodiversity was regarded as quite important, a majority was not ready to pay more taxes for maintaining it. Slightly more than half of the respondents accepted clear-felling of forest. Most would, however, like to see a maximum size set for clear-felling areas. Nearly one out of two of the respondents were of the opinion that the area of forest land under conservation should be increased. Some differences between opinions of different strata were observed. Generally, in the light of public opinion, recent years' changes in forest management directives to more environmental friendly practices in Finland appear to be correct.

We compared biomass and species composition of canopy lichens on 180 lower branches of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three pairs of old-growth and managed (selectively logged) stands in northern Sweden (30 branches per stand). The purpose was to evaluate the effect of substrate quality (branch characteristics) on patterns of lichen biomass for two different growth forms (foliose and fruticose). Old-growth stands had six times higher lichen mass per spruce branch, and two times higher expressed as percentage of branch mass, compared to mature stands of managed forest. Lichen mass was strongly related to mass, diameter, and age of branches. Fruticose, pendulous species (Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp.) were highly sensitive to forest practices. In contrast, type of forest had no significant effect on foliose species. Species number per stand was the same (15 species) in both types of forest, but there were marked differences in the relative abundance of different lichen groups. Results suggest that limited amount of substrate (i.e., small branches) available to lichens, and young branches, providing only a short time for lichen colonization and growth, are important factors limiting epiphytic lichen abundance in managed forests. Conversion of old-growth forest into young, managed stands will lead to a significant reduction in epiphytic lichen mass. This in turn may probably affect nutrient cycling in forests and has negative consequences for animals that utilize canopy lichens as food, shelter, or nesting material.","biodiversity and boreal forests and canopy-living invertebrates and conservation and epiphyte biomass and epiphytes and forest canopies and forestry and lichens and old growth and Picea abies and BIODIVERSITY and COMMUNITIES","10.2307/2269566     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/2269566",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Relationships between occurrence of the species and a number of site and stand variables were analysed by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and direct gradient analysis. Species diversity was significantly higher in old forests and in forests at higher altitudes compared to young forests and forests at lower altitudes. Old trees and snags are considered to be the most important structural components in old forests promoting species diversity of the Caliciales. Threatened or vulnerable species, such as Chaenotheca gracillima, Cybebe gracilenta, Sclerophora coniophaea and S. peronella were confined to forest on rich soils showing no correlation with forest stand age. Chaenotheca brachypoda and C. trichialis were found to be the most typical old forest species among the Caliciales. Humidiphilous species are considered to be less affected by forestry in a humid climate. A change in forestry practice towards methods imitating the natural dynamic processes is considered necessary to maintain species diversity of the Caliciales in boreal forests.

The amount of food removed from the field layer was stable through the winter. Roe deer used the lower part of the study area most heavily. At lower altitudes, older mature stands and edges between medium-aged stands and clear-cuts/plantations were preferred, pole-sized stands and edges between older mature stands and clear-cuts/plantations were used as expected from their availabilities, whereas medium-aged stands, clear-cuts and young plantations were avoided. That snow depth was an important factor determining habitat use by roe deer was evident in three ways: 1) use of areas at higher elevations decreased as winter progressed, 2) use of mature forest stands increased from early to late winter relative to open habitats, and 3) use of mature forest stands was more extensive at higher than at lower elevations compared to open habitats.","Norway","10.2981/wlb.1997.004","https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.1997.004",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Diversity was evaluated by means of species richness, diversity indices, relative abundance curves and rarefaction. The diversity indices appeared to be less suitable for our purpose. Species richness was higher in pine forest than in spruce forest. However, a peak in species richness was found in mosaic forest. For pooled samples (408 ha), 11 bird species recorded in pine forest were not found in spruce forest, seven species were found in spruce forest but nor in pine forest, and seven species were confined to the medium mosaics of pine and spruce forest (on average 56% pine and 44% spruce). We argue that, when mixing two habitat types A and B, the ratio of these habitats that maximize avian diversity depends on the ratio of species confined to habitat A and B, as well as the number of species favoured by the mixture of A and B.

More sensitive so-called red-listed species are today restricted to small remnant habitats in a managed landscape matrix. It has been hypothesized that natural biodiversity can be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, blends natural structures and includes natural composition into the production forest. The most important restoration measures in Swedish boreal forests for promoting biodiversity are to increase the number and quality of undisturbed forests, the amounts of coarse woody debris, the number of deciduous trees, and to introduce fire as an ecological process. On the basis of current knowledge of natural forest dynamics, we here present management options for three major site types in boreal Sweden which mimic natural dynamics better than traditional forestry. In the natural stages, the sites carried (1) Scots pine forest, (2) deciduous or Norway spruce dominated forest, and (3) Norway spruce forest regenerated by so-called gap dynamics, respectively. The flora and fauna that characterize the first two, fire-influenced sites are considered relatively well-adapted to the kind of large-scale disturbances characterizing forestry. On these sites, therefore, the modifications proposed are within today's approach to applying the clear felling system. Sites that seldom experience fire may host species extremely sensitive to large-scale disturbances. If such sites are to be used for timber production, modified forestry practices using selection or shelterwood systems with relatively dense shelterwoods are suggested.

The study area has a long history of extensive grazing by domestic animals. The floristic composition showed a continuous change along the boreal-alpine gradient. The number of species was more or less constant throughout 600 altitudinal m centred around the treeline, and the Aoristic similarity between neighbouring altitudes did not show any abrupt changes at any particular altitude. The treeline position (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) spanned 190 altitudinal m (range 980-1170 m a.s.l.). The number of trees and the basal area each decreased continuously with increasing altitude from 300 altitudinal m below the treeline. The number of birch saplings also decreased from c. 150 m below the treeline towards higher altitudes. Viable, but browsed populations of birch were present along the whole length of all transects, irrespective of aspect and geological substrate, with saplings present up to summit positions at 420 altitudinal m above the treeline. Due to browsing by sheep, mean sapling height at all altitudes above the treeline was 0.2 m. The results are discussed in terms of land use and climate change. It is concluded that future vegetation responses to diminished grazing pressure are likely to override responses forced by changing climate. Such responses could easily be misinterpreted as being governed by climate change, rather than by changes in land use.","treeline dynamics and species diversity and land use and climate change and grazing pressure and Norway and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and VEGETATION CHANGE and PICEA-ABIES and FOREST and SWEDEN and DISTURBANCE and DYNAMICS and ECOTONES and LIMIT and CONSEQUENCES and Mountaineering","10.2307/2997351     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/2997351",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Fertilisation was made in liquid form on a weekly basis during the vegetation period with 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) during each year. The fertiliser also included a balanced composition of P, K, Ca, Mg and S as well as of micronutrients. Irrigation was carried out as soon as a 20 mm water storage deficit developed. It is concluded that there is a large potential to improve Norway spruce production through liquid fertilisation with irrigation. Stem and branch production of Norway spruce was almost doubled due to this treatment. Also, stand needle dry mass and litterfall were markedly increased in comparison with the control. Water and N availability were the two most limiting growth factors. During the experimental period, irrigation had a greater effect on growth than N addition. The gross N uptake increased by 450 kg ha(-1) as a result of 600 kg ha(-1) fertiliser addition. Needle retention was increased for irrigated trees but needle litterfall remained unchanged. Changing the forest management of Norway spruce to intensive cultivatation results in transitional carbon sequestration in both stand and soil compared with an untreated ecosystem.

An additional relationship for Sweden was obtained from the literature. Species richness, and the parameters of the species-area relationships, were then related to the latitude, longitude and percentage woodland cover of each study area. Overall, species richness across all woods in each study area declined with increasing latitude; the proportion of resident species also declined, but that of migrants increased. Numbers of migrant species also increased with increasing woodland cover. Both the slopes and intercepts of the species-area relationships declined with increasing latitude. Thus not only were fewer species available to colonise individual woods at higher latitudes, but the return in terms of species richness for a given increase in area was also less than at lower latitudes. From the species-area relationships, the numbers of species expected to breed in woods of 1 ha and of 15 ha decreased from 13 and 21, respectively, in The Netherlands (latitude 51.7 degrees) to 7 and 13, respectively, in Denmark (latitude 56.3 degrees). Other factors influencing species richness on both local and geographical scales are discussed.","farm woods and latitude and species richness and species-area relationship and woodland birds and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and WOODLAND FRAGMENTS and BREEDING BIRD and AREA and DISTRIBUTIONS and COMMUNITIES and PATTERNS and TURNOVER and ENGLAND","10.2307/2997815     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/2997815",NA,NA," Netherlands","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Old traditional management included grazing early and late in the growing season, mowing in August and light or no fertilizing. The tree cover was the most important factor deciding the composition of vegetation. Time since abandonment was not completely correlated to tree cover, as some plots had a dense canopy and others were situated in the open. The total species number decreased with number of years since abandonment in plots > 0.001 m(2) and <100 m(2). The highest species number in I m2 plots was recorded in the managed site, with 38 species of phanerogams. Fourtyeight % of the indicators of traditional management present in the managed site was recorded in the site which had been abandoned for 30 years. Frequency - log area curves made it possible to group species according to persistence in the award. As a result, a group of functional indicators of rare hay meadows in the region was distinguished.","CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS and FIELD SUCCESSIONAL ECOSYSTEMS and WESTERN NORWAY and CHALK-GRASSLAND and RICHNESS and VEGETATION and AREA and COMMUNITIES and STRATEGIES and Norway","10.1111/j.1756-1051.1999.tb01231.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1999.tb01231.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Enclosures are exposed to different land-use regimes including grazing, mowing, fertilisation and soil disturbance. Pastures have never been fertilised or ploughed and the current grazing pressure is moderate. All investigated pastures are former haymaking areas. Higher conservation values of pastures compared to enclosures is reflected both in patterns of species richness and the occurrence of vulnerable species. Higher species richness in pastures is related to lower nutrient levels, lower loss of ignition in the soil, and higher levels of pH. Vulnerable species are concentrated in species-rich pastures, and have tow local abundance and regional distribution. Enclosures reflect a complexity in land-use, were the effects of mowing, fertilising and ploughing on plant community patterns could not be separated. Tree and shrub species are common in both habitats, and indicate a successional invasion of woody species. Maintenance of land-uses that have created semi-natural grasslands in the long term perspective (grazing, cutting of trees and shrubs, and mowing) is necessary to prevent forest succession, and a prerequisite for future conservation of sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands.

Most species are associated with deciduous trees, particularly oak, and the majority depend on decayed wood or fungi. The forest is a mixture of Norway spruce and deciduous trees and is characterized as being very close to a primeval forest. Sixty-two species of the collected beetles are assumed to be threatened or rare in Scandinavia, 52 species are on the Red Data List in Sweden and 43 species are suggested for a similar list in Norway. Fifteen species are on a list of species threatened in the Nordic region. Compared with other thoroughly sampled forest reserves in Fennoscandia, the forest investigated had one of the richest saproxylic beetle communities known to date. The main reasons for this are assumed to be the abundance of dead wood, the diverse tree composition and the fact that the area had been inaccessible for forest harvesting due to the lack of transportation for timber.","biodiversity and forest reserve and saproxylic beetles and DEAD WOODY MATERIAL and COLEOPTERA","10.1080/02827589950152719     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827589950152719",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Most of them occur in the southern part of Sweden, notably in open, dry, warm pine forests on sandy and rocky ground along the Southeast coast. The reverse situation applies to the beetle fauna connected with Norwegian spruce (Picea abies) where most species are found in the northern part of the country. Some beetle species connected with dead pine have a very relict ditribution as Plegaderus sanatus gobantzi Mull., Temnochila caerulea Ol., Nacerdes carniolica Gistl, Rushia parreyssi (Muls.) and Asemum tenuicorne Kraatz on the island of Gotska Sandon in the Baltic Sea. Out of the red-listed beetles 12 live on recently dead pines, 20 species on trees that have been dead for between 3 to 20 years, 33 species on trees that have been dead between 21 and 50 years and 9 species on old dead trees that have been dead for more than 50 years. Standing dead trees as snags and stumps are the only habitat for 22 species and 6 species only use logs. The remaining species use both snags, stumps and logs of pine. Many pine stands in Sweden have been extensively influenced by forest fires until the end of the last century. Some pine living beetles strongly prefer burned trees. Certain species, such as Oxypteris acuminata (De G.), Stephanopachys linearis (Kug.) and S. substriatus (Payk.) are almost exclusively found in and under the bark of burned stems and an additional 13 red-listed species show a clear preference for burned pines. Polypores, fruitbodies as well as mycelium in dead bark and wood constitute an important food resource for many beetles. species. Seven red-listed species are linked to Fomitopsis pinicola on pine, though they can also be found on the same fungus growing on the stumps of spruce and some deciduous trees. An additional four species and two red-listed Homoptera live on Antrodia sinuosa. Eight species of Coleoptera inhabit pine stems with brown-rot, to be compared with six species living in white-rot wood mainly produced by attacks of Trichaptum abietinum. Many red-listed species on pine have decreased very rapidly during the last decades. The big longhorn beetle Tragosoma depsarium (L.) has disappeared from most areas mainly due to the lack of forest fires and the regulations in the Forestry Act concerning the amounts of fresh dead conifers. This species could also survive in windthrowns of pine, but unfortunately trees are valuable to the forest owner as well as timber or firewood. For the same reason even many of the dead or living pines which are saved for nature conservation purposes in connection with final cuts tend to ""disappear"" from the logged area some years later when some of them are felled by wind. Another such species is the big buprestid beetle Calcophora mariana (L.) that was earlier favoured by the use of unimpregnated railway sleepers, but for the last decades has only been found in one single, very restricted area. It is important for the survival of these and many other red-listed beetles that the few old, naturally regenerated pine stands are saved, and that we save more windthrown pines and burned pine stand for the future.","FORESTS and IMPACT and Sweden",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Karat.) forest landscape in southeastern Norway. The sites studied were natural forests and the charcoal records showed no evidence of fire disturbance that could have broken the continuity in the spruce forests that were established ca. 1700 years ago. Consequently, true spruce forest ecosystem continuity was documented on a landscape level. However, fire disturbed the mixed pine-deciduous forest ecosystems that preceded the present spruce forests, suggesting a shift from fire-prone, to fire-free forest ecosystems. It is argued that the studied forest landscape has the potential to be an important natural reference for future forestry, that would be required to mimic natural forest dynamics to be biologically sustainable. A stereotypic promiscuous use of fire in the regeneration phase may cause serious damages in forest ecosystems that have developed without the impact of fire disturbance.

Plots of species accumulation curves suggested that there may be more than 60 beetle species present in F. pinicola in the area, but that probably all the specialist Ciidae were found. The major factor influencing beetle diversity turned out to be the level of dead wood at and in the vicinity of the sampling site, with a higher number of species per unit volume of sporocarps in areas with high levels of dead wood. There were also significantly more red-listed species in those areas.

Later with the development of the summer farming system the use of the mountains was intensified. This long-term use of the mountains has shaped a montane cultural landscape by livestock grazing, mowing for hay, fuel collection and a variety of other uses. The result is a significant increase of the grassland areas at the expense of the forest. Those semi-natural grasslands and heathlands with specific biological diversity have until recently dominated the mountains but are today decreasing due to forest invasion - which in turn is a result of changes in human land use. The present paper focuses on changes in landscape pattern and differences in landscape development in two mountain valleys with summer farming activities, in Mid-Norway, over the period 1960s-1990s, and seeks to interpret the changes in relation to differential land use and environmental factors. This study contributes examples from human shaped ecosystems in mountains where the fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is addressed. A set of landscape pattern indices commonly used in landscape ecological studies is also used here, and their ecological relevance in the present context is dealt with. The implications of changed land use for biodiversity conservation in those mountains and the relationships to future sustainable agriculture is also briefly discussed.","biodiversity and conservation and disturbance and forest succession and fragmentation and grazing and land use change and mountain and semi-natural grasslands and sub-alpine and sustainable agriculture and FRAGMENTATION and PLANTS and Mountaineering and Norway","10.1023/A:1008173628016     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008173628016",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

The most visible impacts of overgrazing are On the vegetation. In addition, soils and humus have been changed due to morphodynamic processes induced to a large extent by reindeer pasturing. Degradation of the high mountain landscapes within the last 30 years is described on 3 spatial levels: large-scale effects at specific localities, linear effects along reindeer fences, and small-scale effects on the altitudinal zonation of entire mountain systems. The structure of the ecosystem ha changed completely due to reindeer pasturing, which has resulted in landscape degradation under great pasturing pressure. The processes that influence the ecosystem as a function of different pasture intensities are described and show a complex correlation and interaction between the ecofactors. These include destruction of vegetation cover, reduction of roof density, erosion of humus and mineral soil horizons, reduction of soil moisture and soil stability, and changes in plant species composition. On the whole, degradation leads to a depression of the altitudinal belts, indicated by the new organization of the ecosystems. It can be concluded that reindeer herding at current levels is a destructive form of land use in the northern Norwegian high mountains and hence is not sustainable. The author believes that destruction of the natural environment could be reversed, although this is not to be expected.","landscape ecology and high mountains and reindeer and herding grazing and landscape degradation and Norway and Mountaineering","10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0356:HMEALD]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0356:HMEALD]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

These values are similar to those observed for more distant populations from Norway, Finland and Germany. Therefore, the populations seem not particularly depauperate of genetic variation at the microsatellite level. Genetically, the Dutch populations were found to have diverged considerably.

Young People's Responses to the Conflicts over Large Carnivores in Eastern Norway.","Rural Sociology","Controversies over large carnivores are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural com- munities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modern- ization will increase the diversity. To probe such diverse and changing at- titudes towards nature, I conducted a qualitative study of young people in a rural community in eastern Norway. Contrary to popular images of such communities as unified against ""pests,"" all typical views of the car- nivore issue were present. Those in favor of the large carnivores were typically middle-class youths with a strong ""outward"" orientation, while those who wanted to shoot the predators were mostly working-class boys with strong ties to the local hunting culture. This pattern was interpreted as a conflict between dominant and subordinate forms of knowledge, and between abstraction-oriented and production-oriented cultural forms. Aside from the growth of the pro-carnivore middle-class seg- ments, the most significant effect of modernization appeared to be the removal of many young people from the subject matter of the conflict. A ""subculturalization"" of the working-class hunting culture also could be discerned, however. After decades of protection, the four species of large carnivores found in mainland Norway (brown bear, lynx, wolverine, and wolf) are now slowly recovering from the brink of extinction. This development is applauded by environmentalists, managers, biolo- gists, and many politicians. Opinion polls also indicate enthusiasm in a majority of the general population. Increasing carnivore populations have spurred fierce conflicts, however. Livestock depredation and competition for huntable game are key issues, but the killing of hunting dogs and the possibility of attacks on people also feature in the controversies. In the public debate it is often suggested that this is a conflict representing a clash between old and new perspectives on nature, or rural traditionalism and urban modernity.

Distribution of reindeer was mapped using systematic snowmobile surveys during 1991-96 and compared with results from investigations of snow and vegetation characteristics. Maternal reindeer avoided a 10 km zone around the resort. Cows and calves increased in density from 0.6 +/- 0.6 reindeer km(-2) at 5-10 km from the resort to 7.6 +/- 2.2 reindeer km(-2) at 15-25 km from the resort. Bulls and yearlings were more tolerant, constituting nearly 92% of all observed animals 5-10 km from the resort. Nearly all animals avoided the zone within 5 km of the resort. There were no significant differences in distribution of lichen heath, hardness of snow, integrated ram hardness index (IRH) values, or snow depths on ridges with increasing distance from the resort. Available biomass of lichens was ca. 1200 g m(-2) 0-5 km from the resort and decreased to a low of ca. 250 g m(-2) at 15-25 km distance, a pattern that probably reflects overgrazing as a result of avoiding the tourist resort. Such avoidance implies reduced forage intake during winter, substantial reduction in available habitat, and lower productivity of the herd. The results suggest that avoidance by wild animals of sources of anthropogenic disturbance may involve long-term impacts, such as reductions in carrying capacity, that are more serious than those expected from direct physiological stress.","avoidance and development and disturbance and EIA and grazing ecology and lichen and reindeer and Rangifer and snow and tourism and BREEDING BIRD POPULATIONS and OIL-FIELD and ENERGY EXPENDITURES and ACTIVITY BUDGETS and CALVING CARIBOU and PRUDHOE BAY and SNOW and DISTURBANCE and NORWAY and ALASKA",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Current numbers of reindeer are likely lower and fluctuate less than before wild reindeer were depleted and reindeer husbandry started on a large scale. Productivity is about 7-8 kg of meat per head in winter stock. Current problems arise from a multitude of circumstances, some of them related to the problems of practising a subsistence type of living in close connection with a modern industrialized society. Problems include: low production, typical for harsh conditions and use of an unimproved animal stock; the inability to support a modern standard of living solely from reindeer; the collective access to grazing grounds which makes internal management difficult; unclear legal rights resulting in conflicting interests with other land users and formal owners; and the relatively low number of people directly involved in reindeer husbandry. Possible long-term consequences are marginalization and the loss of land use rights, with negative consequences for the Saami as an indigenous people. Reindeer husbandry research addresses these problems by integrating human-ecological and socio-economic aspects with traditional natural science orientated research on reindeer husbandry problems.

During the 5-yr exclusion experiment, the total biomass of mosses in particular, the main winter-food of lemmings, increased within fenced areas as compared to open control areas. In the 15-yr exclosures, Polytrichaceae mosses still dominated, but graminoids (Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carex bigelowii) had also increased. In these longer-term exclosures, dead plant material, consisting of Polytrichaceae moss and graminoid necromass and other plant litter, had increased. By contrast, Kiaeria moss and lichens were absent or had low biomass after 15 yr of grazer exclosure, probably as a result of competitive exclusion. The results suggest that the plant biomass in such low productivity mountain snowbeds can be reduced to a low level by grazing. Grazing also determines the dominance relationships in the plant community and prevents accumulation of plant litter. The observed effects of grazing are inconsistent with hypotheses suggesting that herbivory is of little importance in low productivity environments, but rather support the exploitation ecosystems hypothesis predicting strong grazing impact in such low productivity environments.","PLANT-COMMUNITIES and VEGETATION and EXPLOITATION and GRADIENTS and PATTERNS","10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900209.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900209.x",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

System boundaries were from cradle to farm gate and the temporal boundary was 2017 with future scenarios for 2040. The actual production and consumption in Norway in 2017 was used as a baseline (BL), and the sustainability of future Norwegian domestic production of milk and beef was assessed through three scenarios for 2040: 1) a trend yield scenario (TrendY) based on an expected increase in milk yield following the present trend, 2) a high yield scenario (HighY) with higher increase in the milk yield per cow per year than the trend, and 3) a low yield scenario (LowY) where the milk yield per cow per year was adjusted for covering the domestic demand for beef solely from dual-purpose production and no domestic specialized beef production. The beef production per dual-purpose cow was kept constant and the remaining domestic demand in scenario 1 and 2 were covered by specialized beef production. Climate change was assessed using both a GWP100 and a GWP* approach. The HighY scenario had the lowest impact on climate change using GWP100, but when taking the different behaviors of short- and long-term climate pollutants into account (GWP*), the ranking of the future scenarios changed and favored LowY. The potential biodiversity loss was lower for the LowY scenario because the proportion of concentrates in the dairy cow ration was decreased due to lower milk yield. Similarly, the feed-food competition was lower (land use ratio < 1) for the LowY. The results of our study suggest that the choice of metric for GWP and time frame highly affects the results and conclusions and strategies for climate smart and sustainable livestock production should therefore be made with caution. © 2023","Biodiversity and Climate change and Dual-purpose dairy and beef and GWP* and Land use ratio and LCA and article and beef and benchmarking and biodiversity and climate and climate change and controlled study and cow and dairy cattle and greenhouse gas and greenhouse gas emission and land use and life cycle assessment and livestock and milk and milk yield and nonhuman and Norway and Metronidazole and Milk Ejection","10.1016/j.livsci.2023.105393","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2023.105393",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Conceptual work / scenarios"

"124","rayyan-674260042","Winter distribution of wild reindeer in relation to power lines, roads and resorts","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","Southern Norway holds the last remaining population of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Roads, railroads, and power lines have fragmented the original population into 26 separate herds. The reindeer populations are regulated directly according to availability of winter forage. These winter ranges, generally at lower elevations, are however, often subjected to development. Effects of infrastructure and associated human activity on the distribution of wild reindeer during winter were investigated in the Nordfjella mountain region of western Norway. Systematic aerial surveys of the distribution of ca. 2500 reindeer were conducted during late winter 1986-1998. Areas within 2.5 km from power lines were used less than available in 6 of the 8 sampling years, and areas beyond this zone more than expected. Density of reindeer was 79% lower within 2.5 km from power lines compared with background areas, and increased with increasing distance from infrastructure for comparable habitat. Available forage in terms of lichen cover declined 15-30-fold with distance, and was lowest in the undisturbed areas with the highest density of grazing animals. Areas within 5 kni from resorts or from roads and power lines in combination were avoided in all years. Continued construction of roads, power lines and cabin resorts endanger these available winter ranges, and hence the long term survival of the population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this respect, epiphytic lichens have become a focal group in studies of how logging and silvicultural methods can be adjusted to mimic and restore old-growth conditions. We addressed this issue in a retrospective study in the coastal spruce (Picea abies) forest region of central Norway, surveying 31 old forest sites in order to relate a selected group of epiphytic macrolichens (Fuscopannaria ahlneri, Lobaria pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, Nephroma spp., Platismatia norvegica, Pseudocyphellaria crocata, Ramalina thrausta, and Sphaerophorus globosus) to forest stand characteristics and previous logging history. The lichens were associated with brook ravines, F. ahlneri and P. crocata mostly so, being 10 times more abundant in ravine valley bottoms than on adjacent slopes and plateaus. All species used spruce trees as their main substrate, but L. pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, and Nephroma spp. preferred scattered deciduous trees. Ramalina thrausta and S. globosus occurred more frequently on older trees and increased in number with increasing stand age. In ravine valley bottoms lichens tended to increase in number with increasing tree density (due to increased amount of branches), whereas the opposite was the case on slopes and plateaus (due to higher proportion of high-branched trees). All locations had been selectively cut two or more times during the last 100 yr, with a total harvested volume of 31-124% of present-day standing volumes. After controlling for covariation with stand structure, variables describing logging history (harvested volume, number of cuts, minimum standing volume, and years since last cut) did not explain significant parts of the variation in present-day abundance of the selected lichens. The results suggest that moderate selective cuttings may prove an acceptable management option to sustain viable lichen assemblages on private land.","boreal rain forest and central Norway and dendroecology and epiphytic lichens and forest management and logging history and DOUGLAS-FIR FOREST and OLD-GROWTH and PICEA-ABIES and WESTERN OREGON and REMNANT TREES and SWAN VALLEY and BOREAL and DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and MACROLICHENS and Trees","10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0421:ELINCS]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0421:ELINCS]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The distribution, sex, and general age composition of the reindeer were mapped during the 1998 and 1999 calving seasons (n=776 and n=678, respectively) using systematic snowmobile and ski surveys. Mean reindeer density within preferred habitat was 78% lower in the area <4 km from the tourist resort compared to the area >4 km from the resort (1.47 vs. 6.68 reindeer/km(2), respectively). Mean reindeer density by the power line corridor without traffic was 73% lower in the area <4 kin from the power line compared to areas >4 km from the power line for comparable habitat. Areas <4 kin from anthropogenic structures were avoided despite low levels of human traffic and a high proportion of preferred habitat. Within snow-free sites available for grazing, no significant differences occurred in phenological development of cotton-grass (Eriophorum spp.), in live:dead ratio of plant material, or in graminoid biomass with distance to the tourist resort. Almost 74% of all available forage was located within the avoided 0-4-km zones front the resort or the separate power line. Our results suggest that power lines, even without human traffic, may result in substantial reductions in the use of foraging areas. The combined actions of power lines, roads, and cabins may increase potential avoidance, thereby increasing the use of remaining undisturbed grazing grounds. Possible increased competition for high-quality forage may affect lactation, body condition, and, hence. reproductive success in the long term.","avoidance and calving and disturbance and forage and habitat and Norway and power line and Rangifer tarandus and recreation and reindeer and road and tourism and WILD REINDEER and BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES and INDUSTRIAL-DEVELOPMENT and WINTER DISTRIBUTION and CUMULATIVE IMPACTS and TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS and PLANT PHENOLOGY and JET AIRCRAFT and CARIBOU and DISTURBANCE","10.2307/3803040     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2307/3803040",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

It focuses on nature conservation, which is vital both to maintain nature's ability to store carbon and to preserve ecosystems, as key aspects of the environmental dimension of sustainable development. The paper analyses the perceptions of local, regional and state stakeholders relating to four rural municipalities following diverging land-use trajectories. We find land policy in all four cases to be highly entangled with strategies to achieve growth in terms of income, job creation and population. When nature conservation was not in line with wider economic or social considerations, it was less integrated into land-policy practices. In three of the municipalities, the construction of residential units, holiday-homes or renewable energy parks was prioritized over the preservation of nature areas or cultural landscapes. One case presented a contrasting trajectory, as it involved a clear alignment between nature conservation and economic growth. Here, conservation was considered a key strategy to both sustain the traditional fishery industry and to accommodate the growing tourism. However, while this municipality's restrictive land use was based on a nature conservation understanding, it was also connected to the greenhouse-gas emissions, resource exhaustion and waste generation traditionally associated with international tourism. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of rural municipalities being equipped with sufficient resources if they are to prioritize environmental concerns over the economic and social dimensions of sustainability in their land-use management practices.","Rural land use and Nature conservation and land use and Sustainable land use and Multilevel cooperation and Social economic and environmental & nbsp and sustainability and GOVERNANCE and Norway","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103066","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.103066",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

It is suggested that the regular burning, which has been part of the management of the area, has activated the seed bank of the ericaceous heath, and thus maintained genetic diversity and slowed down ecotype differentiation. The grass heaths, with no combustible material, have been unaffected in this way.

The climate commitments of many countries depend on forests as carbon sinks which must be quantified, monitored, and projected into the future. For projections we need tools to model forest development and perform scenario analyses to assess future carbon sequestration potentials under different management regimes, the expected net present value of such regimes, and possible impacts of climate change. We propose a scenario analysis software tool (GAYA 2.0) that can assist in answering these types of questions using stand level simulations, detailed carbon flow models and an optimizer. This paper has two objectives: (1) to describe GAYA 2.0, and (2) demonstrate its potential in a case study where we analyze the forest carbon balance over a region in Norway based on national forest inventory sample plots. The tool was used to map the optimality front between the carbon benefit and net present value. We observed changes in net present value for different levels of carbon benefit as well as changes in optimal management strategies. We pre-dicted future changes in several forest carbon pools as well as albedo and illustrated the impact of gradual increase in forest productivity (i.e., due to climate warming). Having been updated and modernized from its previous version with increased attention to forest carbon and energy fluxes, GAYA 2.0 is an effective tool that offers multiple opportunities to perform various types of scenario analyses in forest management. © 2023, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

Acidophilic bacteria were isolated by plating on selective solid media, and dominant isolates were identified from their physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The dominant iron-oxidizing acidophile in all three waters was an Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans-like eubacterium, which shared 98% 16S rDNA identity with the type strain. A strain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was obtained from one of the waters after enrichment in pyrite medium, but this iron oxidizer was below detectable levels in the acidic waters themselves. In two sites, there were up to six distinct heterotrophic acidophiles, present at 10(3) ml(-1). These included Acidiphilium-like isolates (one closely related to Acidiphilium rubrum, a second to Acidiphilium cryptum and a third apparently novel isolate), an Acidocella-like isolate (96% 16S rDNA identity to Acidocella facilis) and a bacterium that shared 94.5% 16S rDNA identity to Acidisphaera rubrifaciens. The other numerically significant heterotrophic isolate was not apparently related to any known acidophile, with the closest match (96% 16S rDNA sequence identity) to an acetogen, Frateuria aurantia. The results indicated that the biodiversity of acidophilic bacteria, especially heterotrophs, in acidic mine waters may be much greater than previously recognized.","IRON-OXIDIZING BACTERIA and THIOBACILLUS-FERROOXIDANS and LEPTOSPIRILLUM-FERROOXIDANS and PYRITE and ACIDIPHILIUM and TEMPERATURE and GENERATION","10.1046/j.1462-2920.2001.00234.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1462-2920.2001.00234.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Conflicts arising from wildlife damage in intensively managed landscapes often undermine conservation efforts, making damage mitigation and compensation of special concern for wildlife conservation. However, the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of damage and claims at large scales are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the patterns of damage caused by brown bears Ursus arctos and its ecological and socio-economic correlates at a continental scale. We compiled information about compensation schemes across 26 countries in Europe in 2005-2012 and analysed the variation in the number of compensated claims in relation to (i) bear abundance, (ii) forest availability, (iii) human land use, (iv) management practices and (v) indicators of economic wealth. Most European countries have a posteriori compensation schemes based on damage verification, which, in many cases, have operated for more than 30years. On average, over 3200 claims of bear damage were compensated annually in Europe. The majority of claims were for damage to livestock (59%), distributed throughout the bear range, followed by damage to apiaries (21%) and agriculture (17%), mainly in Mediterranean and eastern European countries. The mean number of compensated claims per bear and year ranged from 01 in Estonia to 85 in Norway. This variation was not only due to the differences in compensation schemes; damage claims were less numerous in areas with supplementary feeding and with a high proportion of agricultural land. However, observed variation in compensated damage was not related to bear abundance.Synthesis and applications. Compensation schemes, management practices and human land use influence the number of claims for brown bear damage, while bear abundance does not. Policies that ignore this complexity and focus on a single factor, such as bear population size, may not be effective in reducing claims. To be effective, policies should be based on integrative schemes that prioritize damage prevention and make it a condition of payment of compensation that preventive measures are applied. Such integrative schemes should focus mitigation efforts in areas or populations where damage claims are more likely to occur. Similar studies using different species and continents might further improve our understanding of conflicts arising from wildlife damage.","brown bear and damage compensation schemes and depredation and Europe and human land use and human-wildlife coexistence and human-wildlife conflicts and large carnivore conservation and supplementary feeding and wildlife management and AGRICULTURAL LANDS and CONFLICTS and LIVESTOCK and CARNIVORES","10.1111/1365-2664.12708     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12708",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Carbon is sequestered in the aggrading biomass of the new forests, but the question remains, to what extent the former arable soils will contribute as sinks for CO2. The present study explored changes in soil C stores following afforestation of former arable land with oak (Quercus robur L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Seven stands of each tree species on nutrient-rich soils made up a chronosequence ranging from 1 to 29 years. An adjacent similar to200-year-old mixed deciduous plantation was included to give information on the possible long term changes in soil C. Soil sampling included organic layers and three layers of the mineral soil to a depth of 25 cm. Development of forest floors sequestered most C in spruce stands. While oak stands sequestered around 2 Mg C ha(-1), spruce stands sequestered approximately 9 Mg C ha(-1) in forest floors over 29 years. There were no differences between the two tree species in C concentration and storage of the three mineral soil layers. Carbon concentration and storage increased in the upper 5 cm of the mineral soil but decreased in the 5-15 and 15-25 cm soil layers with increasing stand age. The soil C store appeared to be undergoing redistribution following afforestation, and mineral soil C stores in 0-25 cm tended to decrease over the 29-year period. Together with the C sequestration of forest floors, this led to fairly similar total soil C stores of around 65 Mg ha(-1) along the 29-year chronosequence. Within this short time span, C sequestration mainly occurred in the biomass of trees while soil C stores were clearly higher in the similar to200-year-old plantation (81 Mg C ha(-1)). The ongoing redistribution of mineral soil C in the young stands and the higher soil C contents in the similar to200-year-old afforested stand suggest that nutrient-rich afforestation soils may become greater sinks for C in long term.

No statistically significant differences in forest characteristics, community of saproxylic beetles or number of red-listed beetles were found between the WKHs and the production forest, probably owing to a combination of profound long-term logging and a lack of will to delineate sufficiently large WKHs in the one area with significantly less forestry impact.

Habitats were registered as land-cover categories (historical and current; broad habitat types) and habitat patch classes (semi-natural and natural; fine-grained habitat types). Spatial overlay analyses and maximum likelihood tests of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to assess the habitat quality of the land-cover categories and the habitat patch classes.

The highest densities of P. scandinavica were found in ""heathland"" and ""grassland in transition into woodland"", while the potential for sexual reproduction was highest in ""grassland"" and lowest in ""grassland in transition into woodland"". The results indicate that many of the populations in the study area are remnants and that the habitats of highest quality are semi-natural habitat patches. The changed land use practices in mountain areas have resulted and will result in fewer and smaller populations.

We investigated 159 sample sites with different histories of logging activity, in four climatic zones in SE Norway and recorded the fungus on 93 out of 4146 inspected logs in 33 of the 159 sites. The fungus was clearly most frequent on Picea abies (5.8%) but we also found it on five Pinus sylvestris logs (0.4%). The frequency of the species depended highly upon the decay class and diameter of the logs. We never found P. nigrolimitatus on recently dead logs and only once on a weakly decayed log. The frequency increased sharply on moderately decayed logs and even further on very decayed logs. We rarely found the species on small spruce logs, but found it on nearly a quarter of spruce logs in the diameter class >40 cm. P. nigrolimitatus exhibited a clear trend in being more frequent on spruce logs in highly productive sites compared to logs in sites of medium and low productivity. Furthermore, R nigrolimitatus showed a clear trend in being systematically more frequent from young to old-growth forest. When we related the frequency directly to the forest management history, as defined by the coarse woody debris profile, it turned out that the fungus was found on 35% of the suitable logs in the stands that had been unmanaged for several tree generations, while it was found on 4-9% of the suitable logs in managed forests. We found an average frequency reduction of 82% from natural forests to managed forests when we compared similar substrates. This frequency reduction in combination with reduced substrate availability suggests a population decline larger than 95% from the period before widespread logging, several centuries ago, until today.

Agricultural P losses are increasingly important for the P concentration in most European rivers, lakes, and estuaries, even though the quantity of P lost from agricultural areas in European catchments varies at least one order of magnitude (< 0.2 kg P ha(-1) to > 2.1 kg P ha(-1)). We focus on the importance of P for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and discuss the benefits, uncertainties, and side effects of the different targeted mitigation measures that can be adopted to combat P losses from agricultural areas in river basins. Experimental evidence of the effects of some of the main targeted mitigation measures hitherto implemented is demonstrated, including: (i) soil tillage changes, (ii) treatment of soils near ditches and streams with iron to reduce P transport from source areas to surface waters, (iii) establishment of buffer zones for retaining P from surface runoff, (iv) restoration of river-floodplain systems to allow natural inundation of riparian areas and deposition of P, and (v) inundation of riparian areas with tile drainage water for P retention. Furthermore, we show how river basin managers can map and analyze the extent and importance of P risk areas, exemplified by four catchments differing in size in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Finally, we discuss the factors and mechanisms that may delay and/or counteract the responses of mitigation measures for combating P losses from agricultural areas when monitored at the catchment scale.","BUFFER ZONES and PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS and NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT and ARABLE LAND and SEDIMENT and DANISH and WATER and CATCHMENTS and LAKES and RETENTION and Phosphorus","10.2134/jeq2004.0439     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","https://doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.0439",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 95 % home range size averaged 0.15 km(2). The proportional distribution of habitat categories in the home ranges was compared with that in the landscape; EDGE (forest <30 m from open habitats) and FIELD (mainly pastures and gardens) ranked first, followed by CROP (farmland ploughed annually), OLD (forest >30 m from open habitats) and YOUNG (clear-cuts and young planted forest). The same ranking was found when the habitats used were compared with those available within the home ranges. Crows devoted more time to perching, mostly in EDGE, than to foraging, mostly in FIELD and CROP. Use of EDGE increased with increasing availability of EDGE in the home range, but the crows used EDGE more than expected from availability only as long as the proportion of EDGE was <0.40. Home range decreased as the proportion of EDGE in the home range increased. The results suggest that an increase in the farmland-forest edge-to-area ratio may increase the density of breeding Hooded Crows, and thus increase the predation risk on bird nests in edge habitats.","ARTIFICIAL GROUND NESTS and HABITAT USE and HOME-RANGE and AMERICAN CROWS and PREDATION and BIRDS and FRAGMENTATION and LANDSCAPE and ECOTONES and SIZE",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is the dominating fish species and can, for management purposes, be subdivided in three different morphs: Deep water spawning (D-) whitefish; River spawning (R-) whitefish; and Shallow water spawning (S-) whitefish. These morphs differ in habitat use, growth and life history characteristics and can be separated by differences in gill raker number. Traditionally, European whitefish was exploited with bottom gill nets and beach seine in subsistence fisheries. In 198 1, the start of a commercial fishery with pelagic gill nets increased the exploitation. The yield from this fishery has varied between 6 and 22 tone with declining yield in later years. This decline in yield was caused by a lower effort. CPUE of European whitefish decreased from 4.3 kg/netnight in 1982 to 1.2 kg/ netnight in 1987, but increased to a new peak in 1993, with 3.7 kg/netnight. The variation in overall CPUE closely followed the fluctuations in CPUE for D-whitefish, the most numerous morph in the lake. These fluctuations in CPUE were connected to variations in year class strength for D-whitefish, where recruitment appeared to alternate between stronger and weaker year classes over several years. Fewer variations were observed in the CPUE of R- and S-whitefish. Total annual mortality in adult fish was about 25-40% indicating that the catch mortality was not very high. Length-at-age of juvenile D-whitefish has decreased since the start of the commercial fishery, whereas that of adult fish has not changed much from 1983 to 1994. At the present level of exploitation, the fisheries in Lake Femund seems to be sustainable without strong effects on the density of adult European whitefish.",NA,NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

The stand series comprised unlogged natural forests and forests that were selectively or clear cut 60-70 years prior to our study. Each stand was described with respect to history of forestry impact and tree-stand structure. Environmental, species number, species abundance and species composition (vegetation gradients obtained as ordination axes) variables obtained for 25 m x 1 m plots in each stand were tested for among-stand differences. Significant among-stand differences were found, partly related to former forest management and partly,due to among-stand differences in topography. Differences among stands related,to management were found for tree stand density, highest in managed stands, and for Dryopteris expansa agg. and Luzula pilosa abundances, peaking in formerly clear-cut stands. Species number (at plot or stand scales) was weakly related to former management. On southerly as well as northerly aspects, gradients in species composition were found that separated plots according to former management. Differences among stand conditioned on topography resulted in opposite patterns in the two series of stands because among southerly stands the clear cut was the least while among northerly the clear cut was the most strongly sloping. Low-inclination sites tended more strongly to be paludified and to have high Sphagnum cover, and to have low abundance of specific microsites with small mosses and hepatics. Vegetation gradients related to soil moisture and microtopography were found for both aspects. A strong gradient in species composition related to tree influence at within-stand scales was found, with variation in species number. Existence of such a gradient should provide for significant biotic effects (of short or long duration) of the environmental changes that take place during forest re-growth: (1) the immediate creation of small or large tree-layer gaps by tree felling; and (2) the closing of the tree layer during the regeneration phase. Most notably, the phases at which the tree layer reaches minimum and maximum cover, respectively, may act as 'bottlenecks' for survival of forest-floor species. We conclude that forestry impacts understorey vegetation by way of changes. in tree-layer structure and, to a lesser extent, substrate availability and the local environment, during forest regrowth. The extent and duration of this impact will depend on a complex set of factors. Our results are consistent with the view that if maintenance of species diversity is aimed at, environmental considerations should be built into forest management practices, preferably by mimicking the natural structural dynamics of the tree layer.

Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.","biological diversity and birch forests and birds and indicators and land use change and monitoring land use impacts and Norway and RLQ analysis and species traits and spruce plantations and trait-environment linkages and FLYCATCHER FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA and TIT PARUS-CINCTUS and SPECIES TRAITS and BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY and ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS and FORAGING NICHES and GUILD CONCEPT and COMMUNITIES and BIODIVERSITY and HABITAT and Betula and Trees","10.1890/1051-0761(2003)13[999:SITFML]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2003)13[999:SITFML]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8% of pre-development densities without significant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217% increase in use of the few remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.

Using a transformative governance lens, we use the case of the Norwegian ""Climate Cure 2030"" for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector to, first, illustrate the mechanisms that have led to the choice of climate mitigation measures; second, to analyze the potential consequences of these measures on biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and, third, to evaluate alternative measures with potential positive outcomes for biodiversity and GHG emissions/removals.

For them, the carnivore controversies are part of a conflict between dominant and subordinate cultural forms and bodies of knowledge. Representing dominant culture and hegemonic knowledge, managers and scientists have a hard time establishing rapport with anticarnivore hardliners. It is suggested that joint practical work may diminish some cultural barriers, and a project where this has been crucial is described. The lynx registration program in southeastern Norway brings together biologists, managers, and local hunters in practical field work in order to make population estimates.

Indigenous relations to nature are, however, based on unity between use and protection, implying that human use is necessary for effective protection. Often protected areas include the homelands of Indigenous peoples, whose needs and rights are still being ignored to a large extent. This paper explores the effects of a plan for a significant increase of large nature protection areas in Norway, still under implementation. Most of the new protection areas are in the heartland of the Indigenous Sami, whose core livelihood is reindeer management. The plan implies transfer of jurisdiction from Indigenous and local domains to formalised central domains. In several cases, this has provoked Indigenous and rural groups to organised resistance. In this case study, there are signs of new tensions between Sami and other rural groups. Indigenous land use can be marginalised by park restrictions and increasing pressure from visitor activity. The Sami response was to boycott the park management board leading to a stalemate. A robust solution seems to require consideration of deeper institutional levels.","national parks and Indigenous peoples and conservation and Sami reindeer management and institutional level analysis and LAND RIGHTS and POLICY and PEOPLE and Norway and Poverty","10.1111/j.1745-5871.2007.00449.x     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-5871.2007.00449.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity. © 2023.

With a modern notion of over-burdening and high transaction costs of the mature state and a disrupting alienation of the individual, the search for institutional solutions that are ""neither market, nor state,"" has intensified in both academia and bureaucracies. However, such : efforts often clash with many of the values of modern Western society. In Northern Norway, the political struggle over the reintroduction of Commons Law for Mountain Areas revealed some of these contradictions. This example also shows why many sub-optimal solutions in modern resource management are favored because of the value attached to individual freedom and equal treatment by the state; even when these contradict the sustainable governing of a resource. In contrast, institutional designs based on smaller collectives are perceived as less attractive because they involve less individual freedom, more duties and more inequality.

The results show that the two strongest determinants that explain actors' initial support of the governance change as a means to alleviate conflict are (i) the relationship of actors to the protected areas in terms of knowledge of the protected areas and mental models on conservation and (ii) the economic relevance of the areas for them. Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sami), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives.

Both species are often considered to be indicators of long-time continuous presence of downed logs in Scandinavian forest stands. Of the stand-level variables, number of logs in late stages of decay was positively related to P. nigrolimitatus presence, while diversity of coarse woody debris was positively related to the abundance of the species. Both the presence and abundance of P. nigrolitnitatus was strongly and positively correlated with the area of forest uninterrupted by major disturbance the past 240 years (equalling 140 years of ""old growth continuity"") in the surrounding landscape (80 ha).

Reindeer being provoked by a snow-mobile discovered the observer at longer distances than reindeer being provoked by a skier (370 [skier] vs. 534 [snowmobile] m; P = 0.002), while total flight (756 vs. 570 m; P = 0.037) and total distance moved (970 vs. 660 m; P = 0.008) by reindeer were shorter for snowmobile than skier provocation. The fright (328 [skier] vs. 328 [snowmobile] m), flight (281 vs. 264 m), and escape (543 vs. 486 m) distances due to skier or snowmobile provocation were not different (P > 0.05). For pooled data, fright distances of reindeer were affected by 2 other independent variables. Fright distance was longer when the animals were provoked from below rather than from above (P = 0.046), while their escape distances were longer when the animals were lying rather than when grazing prior to being provoked (P< 0.05). Based on maximum and minimum distance moved for all provocations pooled, daily estimated energy expenditure of reindeer increased between 31 and 590 kJ, representing 0.2 and 2.9% of their estimated total daily energy expenditure. Overall, provocations by skiers or snowmobiles revealed similar behavioral responses. An estimated maximum rate of 3 daily encounters between reindeer and skiers or snowmobiles during winter vacation and Easter would result in moderate energy costs that should be easily compensated for and thus have no demographic consequences.

Conceptualising cultural expertise as a strategic framing contest, we analyse how the parties struggled over the epistemic basis of the respective case by legitimating their claims to cultural knowledge, drawing on academic research, and discrediting their opponents’ epistemic claims. Our findings suggest that in both cases, Sami claimants successfully established an epistemic basis where their traditional, experiential knowledge combined with independent academic expertise effectively challenged the knowledge claims of their adversaries.

We recorded lichen cover on both sides of potential barriers within comparable habitat in 42 sites for 3 different reindeer herds. We used cover-biomass regressions to assess the relationship between lichen cover and biomass. In 2 of the regions, lichen biomass was 5.3 times and 2.8 times higher in areas isolated by 2 parallel power lines and an adjacent winter-closed road compared to biomass on the other side of the potential barrier. In a third region, lichen biomass did not vary significantly between areas on either side of a single ""inter-closed road. Lichen biomass data suggested that wild reindeer used both sides of a closed road in winter, whereas 2 parallel power lines and a winter-closed road in combination reduced reindeer migration and resulted in very different grazing pressures on either side of the power lines, even 30 years after the power lines were constructed. Construction of power lines, and particularly parallel power lines, should thus be avoided in wild reindeer habitat. Fragmentation of wild reindeer ranges in Norway results in a substantial reduction in available ranges and traditional migration routes between important seasonal ranges, with a likely overall reduction in carrying capacity.","barrier and disturbance and fragmentation and grazing and hydropower and migration and norway and power line and rangifer and reindeer and ungulate and RANGIFER-TARANDUS and WOODLAND CARIBOU and WINTER DISTRIBUTION and CUMULATIVE IMPACTS and CALVING CARIBOU and POWER-LINES and ROADS and MOVEMENTS and AVOIDANCE and ALBERTA","10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0101:EOIOMA]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0101:EOIOMA]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

During the recent decade, visual impact on cultural heritage and heritage sites has become a more frequent but contentious issue in public and academic discussions. Yet, within EIA issues relating to heritage sites and visual impact are rarely debated or critically reflected upon. Today most methods and theories on visual impact and cultural heritage within EIA are transferred from disciplines such as landscape architecture, architecture and geography. The article suggests how working with the concepts and definitions of site and setting can be a methodological tool for delimiting and clarifying visual impact on cultural heritage sites. The article also presents ways of how public participation can be a tool to start exploring the field of what the visual impact on cultural heritage implies and how it effects upon our understanding and appreciation of heritage sites. Examples from a Norwegian case are taken as illustrations to highlight these issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To quantify the decline and spatial differences, we have analysed density changes of old trees between 1926 and 1996 on a regional scale (approximately 50,000 kin 2) in boreal Sweden. The occurrence of old-conifer trees (+159 years) has dramatically decreased in the studied area and today only one third as many old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) can be found as in the 1920s. However, the density of old deciduous trees (+99 years) has not decreased since the early 20th century. Historical baseline data such as these are needed for modern forest management, conservation programmes and ecological restoration projects.

We have used a simulation model in order to predict the quantity of CWD of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in forest landscapes subject to different management regimes. It is shown that in an average, managed forest landscape in Sweden, where the management regimes are changed in order to follow the current requirements for certification by FSC, the amount of CWD will be more than doubled, but it will take more than 100 years to reach the-new level. The increase in the amount of CWD will first be recognised for hard (less decayed) CWD and mainly in young, newly cut stands. Leaving forests unmanaged, retaining living trees and decreasing the destruction of CWD at final cutting, and not removing naturally dying trees are all measures that have a strong positive influence on the amount of CWD.

Several studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest landscape, where also human footprints are found. It is concluded that to ensure successful conservation of the biodiversity of these and other such forests, former land use practices should be documented, and management schemes should be developed on the basis of the acquired knowledge.","biological diversity and boreal forest and conservation and land use history and management and HISTORY and TRANSFORMATION and DIVERSITY and CLIMATE and REGION and Norway and Trees","10.1080/00291951.2012.760002     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/00291951.2012.760002",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Floristic data (189 taxa) were collected in 130 4-m(2) sample plots within 12 summer farms in Roldal, western Norway. The study was designed to sample as fully as possible the range of floristic, environmental, and land-use conditions. Vegetation types delimited by two-way indicator species analysis were consistent with results from earlier phytosociological studies. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis show that rather than being distinct vegetation types, the major floristic variation is structured along a spatial gradient from summer farm to the surrounding heathland vegetation. Species richness (alpha diversity) was modelled against environmental variables by generalized linear modelling and compositional turnover (beta diversity) by canonical correspondence analysis. Most environmental factors made significant contributions, but the spatial distance-to-farm gradient was the best predictor of both species richness and turnover. While summer farms reduce mean species richness at the plot scale, the compositional heterogeneity of the upland landscapes is increased, thereby creating `ecological room' for additional vegetation types and species. Within an overall similarity across scales, soil variables (pH, base saturation, LOI, phosphate and nitrogen) differed considerably in their explanatory power for richness and turnover. A difference between `productivity limiting' factors and `environmental sieves' is proposed as an explanation.

A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.","dispersal and Emberiza hortulana and endangered species and golf and Norway and ortolan bunting and population dynamics and TURF APPLICATION and DIAZINON AG500 and URBAN GRADIENT and LAND-USE and WILDLIFE and DIVERSITY and FARMLAND and GEESE and Population Dynamics","10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0719:EOAGCO]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0719:EOAGCO]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Understanding which demographic processes that affect N-e/N most will improve our understanding of how genetic drift and the probability of fixation of alleles is affected by demography. This knowledge may also be of vital importance in management of endangered populations and species. Here, we use data from 13 natural populations of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in Norway to calculate the demographic parameters that determine N-e/N. Using the global variance-based Sobol' method for the sensitivity analyses, we found that N-e/N was most sensitive to demographic variance, especially among older individuals. Furthermore, the individual reproductive values (that determine the demographic variance) were most sensitive to variation in fecundity. Our results draw attention to the applicability of sensitivity analyses in population management and conservation. For population management aiming to reduce the loss of genetic variation, a sensitivity analysis may indicate the demographic parameters towards which resources should be focused. The result of such an analysis may depend on the life history and mating system of the population or species under consideration, because the vital rates and sex-age classes that N-e/N is most sensitive to may change accordingly.","effective population size and population management and population size and sensitivity analysis and two-sex demographic model and REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS and N-E and DENSITY-DEPENDENCE and PASSER-DOMESTICUS and GENETIC DIVERSITY and SPATIAL VARIATION and SEXUAL ORNAMENT and AGE and DISPERSAL and SELECTION and Population Density","10.1111/mec.14057     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14057",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

I found a negative relationship between plant species richness and the change in species richness and biomass Clue to grazing. These results indicate diversity did not confer greater resilience to increased reindeer grazing intensity. No support for higher grazing pressure in diverse habitats were recorded, thus, these results suggest lower resilience to grazing in species-rich arctic tundra vegetation.","SPECIES-DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and PRODUCTIVITY and HERBIVORES and ECOSYSTEM and STABILITY and COMMUNITIES","10.1657/1523-0430(2006)038[0131:PDARTR]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2006)038[0131:PDARTR]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

It is vital that we understand temporal patterns in the plants' allocation of resources to PSMs, particularly those influenced by human activity. Existing data are insufficient in the long-term perspective of perennial plants (age or ontogeny). We analysed phenolic concentrations in foliage from birch (Betula pubescens Ehr.) considered to be undamaged and growing on 5, 10 and 15 years old clear-cuts in two boreal forest landscapes in Norway, sampled at the peak of the growing season. In sum, low molecular weight phenolic concentrations decreased with age. Apart from one apigenin glycoside, the low molecular weight phenolics co-varied similarly at all ages, suggesting a lack of temporal compound-specific prioritisation of this group. In contrast, the concentration of MeOH-soluble condensed tannins increased with age. The compositional shift fits well with several hypotheses that may provide proximate explanations for age patterns in PSM allocations, including both resource constraints and external pressures. Regardless of these explanations, our study adds an important perennial perspective (plant age) to temporal PSM patterns already well-known in boreal plant phenology (foliage age).",NA,"10.1007/s10886-017-0881-5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10886-017-0881-5",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

The simulation results were used to analyse the effects of different management schedules on wood production, profitability, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Stand data from a 35-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stand with a deciduous admixture were used as the starting point. Stand development was simulated for a period of 35 years, and additionally for 65 years for biodiversity analyses. The three management alternatives were-(1) pure spruce stand: two commercial thinnings with removal of deciduous admixture, regeneration at 70 years, goal to maximize wood production; (2) mixed stand: as the previous one, but the deciduous admixture was maintained throughout the rotation, goal to enhance biodiversity; (3) unmanaged: no treatments. The pure and mixed alternatives including commercial thinnings outperformed the unmanaged one both in the production of merchantable wood and in profitability (value of standing stock for the unmanaged alternative), but did not notably differ from each other. Carbon sequestration was directly proportional to biomass production and thus highest in the unmanaged alternative. The mixed stand had a 50%, and unmanaged stand 88% higher species richness than the pure stand at the age of 70 years. Prolonging the rotation to 100 years also considerably increased the species richness. The applicability of the results and use of the MOTTI simulator in forestry planning are discussed.

A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded variables showed that plant species composition was significantly affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent to fields with mainly cereal crops. In order to preserve botanical diversity in this agricultural landscape, the maintenance of regularly mown road verges should be prioritized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesteralen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesteralen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.","AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES and GEESE BRANTA-LEUCOPSIS and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BARNACLE GEESE and SNOW GEESE and LAND-USE and HABITAT USE and CONSEQUENCES and CONSERVATION and Norway","10.1371/journal.pone.0071912     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071912",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Agricultural","Observational studies"

To develop effective conservation strategies towards such pressures we need to improve our understanding of how species richness and community composition are shaped by species' responses to landscape patterns. In this study we tested relationships between patch size and isolation, species richness and species traits in a fragmented landscape of calcareous grasslands-a diversity hotspot in Southern Norway. We recorded a total of 381 vascular plant species, of which 50 are considered habitat specialists, distributed among 86 habitat patches (50-9,475 m(2)) in 22 of 50 randomly sampled 500 x 500 m-plots. We found that large habitat patches held more species of both generalists and specialists than small habitat patches and that well-connected patches held more specialist species than isolated patches. About 1/3 of the habitat specialists in this study system showed vulnerability to isolation, i.e. lower probability of occurrence in isolated patches. Traits related both to persistence (short lifespan) and colonization ability (low seed production per plant) were predictors of vulnerability to isolation. Our results indicate that both colonization and extinction processes affect species composition and richness, and that the rescue-effect-mitigation of local, area-dependent extinctions through colonization-is reduced in isolated patches. These findings suggest that conservation strategies should place greater emphasis on the spatial configuration of the habitat network, and on the preservation of colonization processes to ensure regional persistence of species.","Connectivity conservation and Fragmentation and Functional traits and Life-history and Plant diversity and Species-area effect and LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS and LAND-USE CHANGE and HABITAT LOSS and METAPOPULATION PERSISTENCE and CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS and CRITICAL THRESHOLDS and EXTINCTION DEBT and RICHNESS and POPULATIONS and DISPERSAL","10.1007/s10531-014-0835-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-014-0835-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In 2002 about one half of the study area was intensively managed for agricultural purposes, 19.3% was woodland and 14.4% was semi-natural grassland. The main vegetation gradient in the area reflected long-term management (land-use) intensity. Both species richness and habitat specificity decreased with increasing management intensity. Semi-natural grassland species occurred throughout the landscape, although with some concentration to semi-natural grasslands. The two measures of habitat specificity both peaked in semi-natural grasslands. Comparison of the present patterns of vascular plant distributions with information on past land-use derived from a map from 1865, indicate that species typical of semi-natural grasslands persist long after land use activities have come to an end and that there is an extinction debt in the vascular flora. The significant positive relationship between patches with high richness of species typical of semi-natural grasslands, remnant semi-natural grassland patches and man-made structures with long continuity, shows that restoring formerly open semi-natural grassland 'hot spots' in a agricultural landscapes is advantageous both for conservation of cultural and biological values.

Plot at five sites located within 60 km of Oslo mostly cultivated with small grain were used. They represented three soils: A) artificially levelled silty clay loam (3 sites); B) clay (1 site); and C) unlevelled loam with high aggregate stability (1 site). Mostly two of the used tillage systems are reported here: Pl-Au (ploughing in autumn, harrowing in spring), No-Au (no tillage in autumn). Winters could be cold, mild or variable. Due to the distribution of rainfall, evaporation and soil frost during the year, most of the surface runoff occurred during winter and early spring, but also in late autumn due to soil saturation by water. Average losses over 7 yr by Pl-Au were: 2700-6350 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) for soil type A, 1043 for type B and 158 for type C. With no tillage in autumn the following losses relative to ploughing autumn were 0.12, 0.2 and 0.66 respectively for A, B and C soils. Erosion risk was highest with autumn tillage, especially on soil A mostly due to the levelling effect. Infiltration capacity were greatest and erodibility lowest on soil type C. Infiltration capacity was less than 1 mm/h at saturation on soil type A causing surface runoff, even with moderate rainfall intensities. The empirical yet dynamic erosion model ERONOR simulated well the average soil losses for soil types and tillage systems over several years and also distributed surface runoff and soil losses throughout the year satisfactorily. The model does not handle processes on a large scale, but still it worked rather well in agricultural watersheds with no appreciable net losses due to large scale processes. The model can point out parcels with a high erosion risk within a watershed, and it can estimate the energy factor R in the Norwegian version of the USLE. The model predicts increased erosion in southeast Norway based on climate predictions of milder and rainier winters.

A peat profile was taken from the vicinity in each of two clearance cairn fields where several cairns were analysed for pollen. The pollen samples from the peat profiles give an environmental context for the pollen samples from the clearance cairns, and this combination of samples assists in evaluating the management practices that were in place on the cairn fields during different time periods. In both study areas cultivation layers under the clearance cairns are dated to the Late Roman Iron Age (cal. AD 200-400), while the oldest clearance cairns are dated to the Migration period (cal. AD 400-570), and a second phase of clearance cairn establishment is dated to the Medieval period (cal. AD 1030-1537). Abandonment of the two cairn fields is dated to c. AD 1700. Pioneer trees were a feature on or around the clearance cairn fields during most of the Iron Age, whereas the cairn fields were more open in medieval times. The investigation suggests that cereal cultivation on the clearance cairn fields is difficult to detect in local peat deposits, and that caution is needed when interpreting lack of Cerealia pollen. Management practices on the cairn fields are discussed and a change in management practice is indicated in association with medieval intensification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Natural old Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. forests have been replaced increasingly by dense, even-aged plantations. This study aims at increasing our knowledge about populations of old forest associated lichens in P. abies plantations. In differently aged plantations, we measured occurrence of six lichen species and the population size and reproductive effort of :five lichen species. We found that the success of colonizing plantations differed because of species-specific constraints and needs, and that species occurrence depended on stand age and branch quality. A high number of reproducing thalli and small juvenile thalli of the cyanolichen Lobaria scrobiculata (Scop.) DC. and the pendulous lichen Ramalina thrausta (Ach.) Nyl. suggest effective recruitment within plantations. The populations of the cyanolichens Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. and Pseudocphellaria crocata (L.) Vain, were too small to be viable and demand special concern to survive in managed forests. The abundance of old forest associated lichens in a managed boreal rainforest could be promoted by a varied and heterogeneous branch structure, increased rotation periods (increase the value of plantations as propagule sources), small clearcuts and retention trees (shorten the distance between sources of propagules and target substrate), and maintaining Salix and Sorbus trees (important host trees for cyanolichens and thereby important dispersal sources).","LOBARIA-PULMONARIA and POPULUS-TREMULA and SPRUCE FOREST and DISPERSAL and GROWTH and LANDSCAPES and BIOMASS and METAPOPULATION and COLONIZATION and GRADIENTS and Norway","10.1139/X11-091     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/X11-091",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

These changes have been predicted to impact the distribution and abundance of wildlife species relying on willow thickets as habitat. We assessed the relation between variables quantifying willow thicket configuration and population dynamics of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in three riparian regions in Finnmark, northern Norway, which were subject to intense browsing by semi-domesticated reindeer. The tundra vole, which exhibits 5-year population cycles in Finnmark, is the dominant small rodent species in riparian landscape elements in southern arctic tundra. In the course of a 4-year trapping study, tundra vole populations went through the cyclic phases of increase, peak and crash, however, with distinct differences between the three regions in the population dynamics. Within regions, the occupancy pattern during the increase phase was positively related to willow thicket configuration (in particular edge density and willow height) only in the region attaining the highest abundance and occupancy. However, local abundance was not clearly related to habitat features within any regions. The lack of consistency in the response of tundra vole populations to willow thicket configuration, as well as the positive relation between the degree of thicket shredding and tundra vole habitat occupancy in one of the regions, indicates that tundra voles will not be much affected by climate or browsing induced changes in the shrubbiness of the tundra in the future.","Over-browsing and Shrub expansion and Fragmentation and Abundance and Occupancy and Large-scale study and SPACE-USE RESPONSES and MICROTUS-OECONOMUS and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and SHRUB EXPANSION and REINDEER and HERBIVORES and LEMMINGS and FOREST and VEGETATION and ECOSYSTEM","10.1007/s00300-010-0908-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-010-0908-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Except for Black-tailed Godwits (<30 pairs) and Ruffs (mainly in N Norway), these species are relatively common and widespread in the country. However, nearly all species have experienced recent declines, with only Dunlins having an apparently stable population during the last two decades. Many lowland populations of waders were probably severely affected by intensified drainage and cultivation of wetlands during the 1900s. Furthermore, recent changes in agriculture might have been unfavorable for meadow-breeding waders, such as an increasing use of fast-or early-growing crops which reduces habitat quality and/or leads to more disturbance from farming activities, intensified drainage of meadows, and planting of trees. Increased predation pressures might also have affected some wader populations, but there is little national data to evaluate this hypothesis. Some possible actions to mitigate the loss of wader populations in Norway are discussed and we suggest some priorities for future research. © 2021, International Wader Study Group.

This paper presents a regional study of pre-industrial forest conditions and examines the effects of the industrial exploitation of ecosystems dominated by Not-way spruce in northern Sweden. Historical records covering a period which preceded industrial logging in the study area (1917-1927) were used to obtain quantitative data on forest structure and influence of forest fires. These data were compared with a modern data set (2003) to analyse changes due to the industrial transformation of the forest. The early 20th century landscape was dominated by old, multi-cohorted spruce forests and mixed coniferous forests. It was found that fire affected both the structure and composition of the landscape. In post-burnt areas, even-aged forests dominated by deciduous species were the principal forest type. Between the early and modern data sets, profound changes in tree-species composition and age structure were documented. While the total volume of deciduous species increased substantially, the coverage of forests dominated by deciduous species decreased. There was also a significant increase in pine-dominated forests and in the total volume of pine. The industrial transformation of the studied landscapes has had profound effects oil the structure of spruce forests, but much less so oil deciduous forests. The study concludes that the present forest structure is a function of past management regimes, and that future transformations of the landscape will continue, thus affecting the natural variability and biodiversity of the forests.","forest history and disturbance dynamics and deciduous forest and fire and birch and PICEA-ABIES FOREST and FIRE HISTORY and BOREAL FORESTS and DECIDUOUS FORESTS and LAND-USE and DISTURBANCE and DYNAMICS and Sweden and Norway and Trees","10.14214/sf.173     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.173",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, current climate policies only partially credit forest carbon sequestration and bioenergy policies are handled independently of forestry. Using Norway as a case study, we analyze two sets of simulated carbon tax/subsidy policies, one crediting forest carbon sequestration while maintaining predetermined harvest levels and utilization of wood, and another targeting GHG fluxes in the entire forest industrial sector allowing harvest levels and wood markets to change in response to the policy. Results indicate that GHG emission reduction potentials differ substantially between the two policies, being several times higher for the latter than the former policy at a given carbon price. This suggests that (i) previous research efforts in Europe have not captured the full mitigation potential as they have not included adaptations in the harvest level and the wood market and (ii) climate policies should target GHG fluxes in the entire sector to utilize its potential contribution for mitigating climate change.","CARBON SEQUESTRATION and ECONOMIC-EFFICIENCY and MODEL and IMPACTS and Trees","10.1139/cjfr-2012-0457     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2012-0457",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context, the ecosystem services (ES) framework has been widely adopted for identifying and assessing the values at stake, yet the concept ignores benefits from water and land use functions as important contributions for societal welfare. This paper aims to contribute knowledge for improved benefit assessments in human-modified landscapes, exemplified by watersheds regulated for the production of hydropower. Through a case study approach in two regulated watersheds in Norway, beneficiaries' perceptions of the benefits associated with key watershed activities, i.e., hydropower production, kayaking, angling, and hiking, are presented. Considering the beneficiaries' perspectives, we discuss the relative ability of economic, quantitative, and qualitative assessment methods to present benefits. The study shows that benefit assessments must be carried out on different scales of governance, as benefits are context and scale dependent. We argue for an approach which considers a balance of benefits obtained from ecosystem services, and from water and land use functions within ecological limits. The suitability of the ES framework for guiding benefit assessments in a human-modified landscape and its complementarity with the sustainability concept for informing local-level decision-making are discussed.","ecosystem services and benefit assessments and beneficiaries and regulated watercourses and sustainability dimensions and hydropower and VALUES and VALUATION and SCALE and Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.3390/su11061821     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061821",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

A transplantation experiment at two localities was carried out in close cooperation with the responsible authorities. An alarming problem for L. hibernicum is the imminent challenge of a habitat under threat. A parallel experiment with a comparable yet common species, Leptogium saturninum, was performed to exclude variables related to the experimental method. Four years after transplantation of lichen fragments, the rate of survival has levelled off to about 12% for L. hibernicum and 19% for L. saturninum. The decrease in surviving material is largest one year after transplantation, while the amount of surviving material stabilises over the following three years.

Further, limited knowledge is available for mixed forest management compared to monocultures. In this study, different PCT strategies were tested to investigate the effect of PCT and timing of PCT on the production and profitability of Norway spruce monocultures and mixed Norway spruce–birch stands. A forest decision support system was used to simulate stand development during the whole rotation. Our study findings show that there is a positive effect of PCT on Norway spruce plantations’ long-term profitability but that the timing of PCT has little effect on profitability. However, site variation might influence the effect of PCT timing on the profitability of Norway spruce stands. Moreover, we also found that retaining 1000 Norway spruce ha−1 and 1000 birch ha−1 after PCT supports a mixture of Norway spruce and birch over a full rotation, with little or no economic loss compared to pure Norway spruce stands. Therefore, such a mixture can lead to profitable production while still providing other ecosystem services. © 2022 by the authors.","early PCT and late PCT and mixed forest and Norway spruce and pre-commercial thinning and stump sprouting and Artificial Intelligence and Ecosystems and Forestry and Losses and Mixtures and Rotation and Artificial intelligence and Decision support systems and Plants (botany) and Early pre-commercial thinning and Late pre-commercial thinning and Mixed forests and Norway spruce stands and Picea Abies (L.)

Norway is currently making a significant move to establish a new management model based on national reindeer regions and regional management plans. A focus on wild reindeer as a flagship species allows the species to be included as a broad conservation objective in complex land-use plans. The authors surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Rondane and Setesdal regions to examine their perceptions of the current status of reindeer and how management relates to other social and development issues. Local actors and institutions, including hunters, were perceived as more responsible and suited to make decisions about reindeer population sizes and management objectives than non-local actors.

Our basic hypothesis is that human influence in the Anthropocene is ubiquitous, and we predict that biodiversity hot spot modeling can be improved by addressing three challenges raised by the increasing ecological influence of humans: (i) anthropogenically modified responses to individual ecological factors, (ii) fundamentally different processes and predictors in landscape types shaped by different land use histories and (iii) a multitude and complexity of natural and anthropogenic processes that may require many predictors and even multiple models in different landscape types. We modeled the occurrence of veteran oaks in Norway, and found, in accordance with our basic hypothesis and predictions, that humans influence the distribution of veteran oaks throughout its range, but in different ways in forests and open landscapes. In forests, geographical and topographic variables related to the oak niche are still important, but the occurrence of veteran oaks is shifted toward steeper slopes, where logging is difficult. In open landscapes, land cover variables are more important, and veteran oaks are more common toward the north than expected from the fundamental oak niche. In both landscape types, multiple predictor variables representing ecological and human-influenced processes were needed to build a good model, and several models performed almost equally well. Models accounting for the different anthropogenic influences on landscape structure and processes consistently performed better than models based exclusively on natural biogeographical and ecological predictors. Thus, our results for veteran oaks clearly illustrate the challenges to distribution modeling raised by the ubiquitous influence of humans, even in a moderately populated region, but also show that predictions can be improved by explicitly addressing these anthropogenic complexities.","forest and hollow oaks and land use change and landscape structure and large trees and presence-absence and Quercus petraea and Quercus robur and species distribution modeling and REGRESSION-MODELS and KEY HABITATS and LAND-USE and CONSERVATION and DIVERSITY and HYPOTHESIS and SPACE and AREAS and Veterans","10.1002/ece3.3305     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3305",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Veteran oaks (biodiversity hotspot habitat)","Observational studies"

This habitat geographically coincides with the most densely populated area of Norway. Many habitat specialists, along with the habitat itself, are red-listed because of land-use change, forest encroachment, and invasive species that cause habitat loss and greater isolation of remaining patches. To ensure effective conservation, data on species presences and absences are necessary to quantify states, changes, and extinction risks in specific populations and habitat patches. New information We present presence-absence data of 49 vascular plant species in 15 patches of dry calcareous grassland habitat, surveyed in 2009, 2019, and in 2020.

Drift samples were compared to examine if drift densities, and thus drift prey availabilities for juvenile salmon, were lower in the ice-free than the ice-covered area. In addition, juvenile salmon stomach contents were compared to benthos and drift in the ice-free area to examine salmon winter feeding habitat. Zooplankton, originating from the reservoir, dominated drift at the ice-free site but had lower densities at the downstream ice-covered site. Excluding zooplankton, Chironomidae comprised most of the remaining drift at both the ice-free and ice-covered site, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Simuliidae. No Trichoptera were found in the drift samples. There was no consistent diel periodicity in drift. Benthos was dominated by Chironomidae, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Other invertebrates occurred in low numbers. Juvenile salmon demonstrated size-selective feeding and fed mainly on Ephemeroptera, followed by Trichoptera and Plecoptera. No zooplankton and few Chironomidae were found in the stomach samples. Stomach content was more similar to benthos than to drift, indicating a larger extent of benthic than drift feeding. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that lack of ice cover reduced the invertebrate drift or caused diel periodicity in the drift. Differences in drift between areas with and without ice could not account for the observed differences in mortality of juvenile salmon during the winter in these areas.","Benthos and Invertebrate drift and Prey size and Regulated river and Salmo salar and Stomach contents and STREAM INVERTEBRATES and DRIFT PATTERNS and SALAR L and PARR and FOOD and PERIODICITY and BEHAVIOR and DENSITY and TROUT and ALTA","10.1007/s10750-010-0118-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0118-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

Reindeer nomadic husbandry is a coupled social-ecological system that sustains resilience by interacting with the animals and environment: either the herders adjust their actions to animal behavior or change this behavior in ways that suit the herd and pastures. Stressors and shocks affecting Sámi reindeer husbandry are, for instance, sudden warm air temperatures with subsequent snow melting and freezing in winter, bad grazing conditions, loss of grazing lands, and even socio-economic reforms. All these are sudden, unprepared, or forced changes. Climate change resilience includes using reindeer herders’ Indigenous knowledge of selective breeding by maintaining different phenotypes of reindeer such as non-productive and castrated animals in the herd. Nevertheless, in Sámi reindeer husbandry in Norway today, low numbers of male reindeer and the absence of castrated animals challenge the herders’ resilience coping strategies. This chapter discusses factors that constrain resilience in herding societies, contribute to the transformation of reindeer husbandry and the erosion of resilience in the herding society. © The Author(s) 2024.","Reindeer husbandry and Social-ecological resilience and Tipping points in reindeer husbandry and Thinking","10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42289-8_8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

"206","rayyan-674230321","Light and temperature controls of aquatic plant photosynthesis downstream of a hydropower plant and the effect of plant removal","Science of the Total Environment","Many rivers worldwide are regulated, and the altered hydrology can lead to mass development of aquatic plants. Plant invasions are often seen as a nuisance for human activities leading to costly remedial actions with uncertain implications for aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Mechanical harvesting is often used to remove aquatic plants and knowledge of plant growth rate could improve management decisions. Here, we used a simple light-temperature theoretical model to make a priori prediction of aquatic plant photosynthesis. These predictions were assessed through an open-channel diel change in O2 mass balance approach. A Michaelis-Menten type model was fitted to observed gross primary production (GPP) standardised at 10 °C using a temperature dependence from thermodynamic theory of enzyme kinetics. The model explained 87 % of the variability in GPP of a submerged aquatic plant (Juncus bulbosus L.) throughout an annual cycle in the River Otra, Norway. The annual net plant production was about 2.4 (1.0–3.8) times the standing biomass of J. bulbosus. This suggests a high continuous mass loss due to hydraulic stress and natural mechanical breakage of stems, as the biomass of J. bulbosus remained relatively constant throughout the year. J. bulbosus was predicted to be resilient to mechanical harvesting with photosynthetic capacity recovered within two years following 50–85 % plant removal. The predicted recovery was confirmed through a field experiment where 72 % of J. bulbosus biomass was mechanically removed. We emphasise the value of using a theoretical approach, like metabolic theory, over statistical models where a posteriori results are not always easy to interpret. Finally, the ability to predict ecosystem resilience of aquatic photosynthesis in response to varying management scenarios offers a valuable tool for estimating aquatic ecosystem services, such as carbon regulation. This tool can benefit the EU Biodiversity Strategy and UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 The Authors","Light and Macrophyte removal and Metabolic theory and Photosynthesis and Regulated river and Resilience and Temperature and Biodiversity and Biomass and Ecosystem and Humans and Aquatic ecosystems and Enzyme kinetics and Forecasting and Metabolism and Rivers and Aquatic plants and Down-stream and Gross primary production and Hydropower plants and Macrophytes and Mechanical and aquatic plant and light and macrophyte and photosynthesis and resilience and Sustainable Development Goal and temperature effect and aquatic environment and aquatic species and Article and controlled study and ecosystem resilience and environmental exposure and environmental impact and environmental management and enzyme kinetics and harvesting and hydropower and Juncus and Juncus bulbosus and nonhuman and plant removal and primary production (biomass) and temperature dependence and temperature sensitivity and water analysis and water quality and water temperature and biodiversity and biomass and ecosystem and human and physiology and temperature","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169201","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169201",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Quasi-observational studies"

These bioeconomy strategies plan to use renewable biological resources, which will increase timber and biomass demands and will potentially conflict with multiple other ecosystem services provided by forests. In addition, these forest ecosystem services (FES) are also influenced by other, different, policy strategies, causing a potential mismatch in proposed management solutions for achieving the different policy goals. We evaluated how Norwegian forests can meet the projected wood and biomass demands from the international market for achieving mitigation targets and at the same time meet nationally determined targets for other FES. Using data from the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) we simulated the development of Norwegian forests under different management regimes and defined different forest policy scenarios, according to the most relevant forest policies in Norway: national forest policy (NFS), biodiversity policy (BIOS), and bioeconomy policy (BIES). Finally, through multi-objective optimization, we identified the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario. The results for all scenarios indicated that Norway will be able to satisfy wood demands of up to 17 million m3 in 2093. However, the policy objectives for FES under each scenario caused substantial differences in terms of the management regimes selected. We observed that BIES and NFS resulted in very similar forest management programs in Norway, with a dominance of extensive management regimes. In BIOS there was an increase of set aside areas and continuous cover forestry, which made it more compatible with biodiversity indicators. We also found multiple synergies and trade-offs between the FES, likely influenced by the definition of the policy targets at the national scale. © 2022","Ecosystem services and Forest management and Forest policy and Multi-objective optimization and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Foreign Trade and Forest Management and Forestry and Norway and Norwegian and Wood and Climate change and Economic and social effects and International trade and Timber and Forest ecosystem and Management regime and Multi-objectives optimization and National forests and Policy analysis and Policy scenario and Trade off and Wood demand and Multiobjective optimization","10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102899","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102899",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line","Conceptual work / scenarios"

An effective measure to increase wild bee diversity is to enhance plant diversity. However, the effect on bee diversity of augmenting plant diversity depends on site-specific environmental conditions. We aimed to make spatial predictions of where: (a) environmental conditions maximize bee diversity, so that such areas can be prioritized for augmenting plant diversity; and (b) populations of threatened wild bee species are most likely to occur. We surveyed bee communities in traditionally managed hay meadows in SE Norway and modelled bee diversity as a function of climate, habitat area, and distance to nesting substrates. We used independent data to validate our predictions and found that plant and predicted bee species richness together explained 76% and 69% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness in forested and agricultural ecosystems, respectively. In urban areas, the predicted bee species richness alone explained 31% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness. Using data from online species occurrence records, we found that – compared to species of lower conservation concern – threatened solitary bee species were more typically recorded in areas with a high predicted solitary bee species richness. We show that spatial predictions of bee diversity can identify sites where augmenting plant diversity is likely to be most effective. Maps of predicted bee diversity can guide species surveys and monitoring projects and increase the chances of locating populations of threatened bees. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biodiversity conservation and Habitat management and Pollinators and Spatial predictions and Wild bees and Norway and bee and species conservation and species diversity and species richness and wild population","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104267","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104267",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Spatially explicit model prediction of species richness"

In Mid-Norway, farmers scare spring-staging pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus off their land to protect crops, and this has had clear effects on goose distribution. To protect the geese, Norwegian authorities have implemented economic compensation to farmers to discourage scaring, but this has not been prioritised to accommodate the biological requirements and dispersal patterns of the geese, though such an approach is clearly needed. To address this need, we assessed the negative effects of scaring geese during 2004-2007, and built a species distribution model to identify sites suitable for goose foraging. We subsequently combined known foraging sites with sites identified by our model and prioritised these sites according to their connectivity, perimeter area ratio, years of historic use and proximity to roost. By combining historic data on foraging sites, a species distribution model, and a simple, accountable site selection process we demonstrate how the current compensation scheme can be made 10 times more efficient through strategic prioritisation. Our approach has direct implications for alleviating similar goose-agriculture conflicts throughout Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these two perspectives approach land from different ends and it can be difficult to see how studied variables contribute to broader policy goals. In this paper, we argue that there is a need to better select variables to study land systems as social-ecological systems, and to align research more with those policy goals. Concentrating on the European continent, we pursue three interrelated objectives: we (1) build a classification of land systems variables, (2) examine where existing land systems research is positioned in this classification, and (3) compare a set of policies and science-policy frameworks with the classified research. To do so, we conduct a systematic review of 69 peer-reviewed, empirical land systems papers, as well as four overarching policies and science-policy frameworks. We find that over 60% of the reviewed papers include both environmental and social variables, and we identify 154 unique variables studied, 57% of which are environmental. The average paper examines four times as many environmental variables as social ones. We find that policies and science-policy frameworks stress social variables more and include health and air quality aspects that are lacking in the reviewed land systems research. Our classification can help to design research that includes both social and environmental variables and is aligned with broader policy goals. We highlight social variables with available spatial data to encourage a more balanced and integrative social-ecological research design, going beyond a focus on the built and natural environment. Our classification can contribute to guiding land systems researchers towards greater policy relevance. We hope that our classification contributes to a conversation within land systems research on the selection of variables, as well as its further development.","Land use and Land cover and Science-policy and Land change and Rural systems and SDGs and Pattern and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and DRIVERS and CHALLENGES and FOREST and OPPORTUNITIES and ABANDONMENT and INTENSITY and PATTERNS and LANDSCAPES and EMERGENCE","10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.034     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.06.034",NA,NA,"European","Land use in general","Summarised evidence"

It is unclear, however, how genetic enhancement of basic traits such as tree growth may influence the function of life supporting soil ecosystems. We studied the potential cascading effects of genetic increases in growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) on a range of soil chemical and biological properties. Because this species is a prime candidate for the genetic enhancement of boreal forest landscapes and it has been introduced around the world, its impacts on soil microbiomes are likely of importance both locally and globally. In a 40-year common garden, we assessed how genetic increases in growth generated through controlled crossing of high-quality “plus” trees from across the central boreal zone of Sweden influenced a range of soil properties beneath the canopies. Properties included pH, carbon, nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, respiration rate, and the composition of microbial communities assessed via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). We found that Norway spruce family significantly affected each of the seven chemical properties assessed, with differences of up to 140% among families, and that three of the seven were significantly correlated with mean family growth rate. We also found that fungal PLFAs varied significantly across Norway spruce families, but these differences were not strongly related to mean family growth rate. This study, representing just one cycle of selective breeding, suggests that genetic increases in tree growth rates may also be inadvertently altering soil communities and ecosystem services. Such alterations across forest landscapes may have unexpected implications for the function of forest ecosystems (i.e., nutrient cycling) as well as processes of global significance (i.e., carbon sequestration). © 2022 The Author(s).

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

This study presents a comprehensive European Union wide (EU15 plus Norway and Switzerland, EU*) assessment of potential future changes in terrestrial carbon storage considering these effects based on four illustrative IPCC-SRES storylines (A1FI, A2, B1, B2). A process-based land vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM), adapted to include a generic representation of managed ecosystems, is forced with changing fields of land-use patterns from 1901 to 2100 to assess the effect of land-use and cover changes on the terrestrial carbon balance of Europe. The uncertainty in the future carbon balance associated with the choice of a climate change scenario is assessed by forcing LPJ-DGVM with output from four different climate models (GCMs: CGCM2, CSIRO2, HadCM3, PCM2) for the same SRES storyline.

This requires maintenance of functional networks of representative natural forest and cultural woodland habitats. We first review the policy implementation process regarding protected areas in Sweden 1991-2010, how ecological knowledge was used to formulate interim short-term and strategic long-term biodiversity conservation goals, and the development of a hierarchical spatial planning approach. Second, we present data about the amount of formally protected and voluntarily set aside forest stands, and evaluate how much remains in terms of additional forest protection, conservation management and habitat restoration to achieve forest and environmental policy objectives in the long-term. Third, a case study in central Sweden was made to estimate the functionality of old Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous forest habitats, as well as cultural woodland, in different forest regions. Finally, we assess operational biodiversity conservation planning processes. We conclude that Swedish policy pronouncements capture the contemporary knowledge about biodiversity and conservation planning well. However, the existing area of protected and set-aside forests is presently too small and with too poor connectivity. To bridge this gap, spatial planning, management and restoration of habitat, as well as collaboration among forest and conservation planners need to be improved.","forest protection and restoration ecology and forest policy and connectivity and green infrastructure and umbrella species and forest disturbance regimes and participation and collaboration and WOODLAND KEY HABITATS and CONSERVATION and BOREAL and THRESHOLD and FRAGMENTATION and SUITABILITY and UMBRELLA and TARGETS and SIZE and Sweden","10.14214/sf.90     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.90",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While we know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of information about many mustelids. We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as “the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon”. We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines. © 2022 The Authors.

Several plant traits (seed size, plant height, leaf dry weight and specific leaf area) are suggested to be functionally important in early life stages, and the impact of such traits is expected to increase with habitat harshness. In this comparative study we examine the relative role of different plant traits for herb community patterns on both a local and regional scale in two contrasting alpine ecosystems in southern Norway: (1) a sub-continental region with more dry and productive, base-rich soils (Hol, Hallingdal) and (2) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal). Differences in species richness between regions were mainly due to higher herb richness in the base-rich region (n=55) than in the acidic region (n=13). Among traits, herb species seed weight was higher at the acidic site. The relative importance of traits for explaining herb local abundance and regional distribution tended to be stronger at the acidic site. No trait had a significant effect at the base-rich site, although seed weight and seed number were marginally non-significant. Plant clonality was positively related to local abundance and marginally to regional distribution at the acidic site. Plant frequency-trait correlations were generally higher in the acidic region then in the base-rich region. There was further a (marginal) increase of herbs with large seeds and with a dependence on sexual reproduction with increasing pH levels in Hol. Soil pH was also the most important environmental variable for herb richness in Hol, while no environmental variable was significantly related to herb richness in Setesdal. The study suggests that recruitment through seed is critical for the alpine herb community patterns especially in harsh habitats. Possible explanations for recruitment constraints include both soil acidity (low pH and Ca levels in addition to possible aluminium toxicity) and disturbance through grazing.","clonality and oceanic and pH and recruitment and seed weight and sub-continental and PLANT-SPECIES DIVERSITY and SEED and DISTURBANCE and VEGETATION and PATTERNS and RECRUITMENT and SUCCESSION and RICHNESS and INCREASE and IMPACT and Norway","10.1007/s11258-005-0197-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11258-005-0197-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

To meet the goals of forest management on afforested fields, information on the effects of former agricultural land use on soil fertility is needed. In this study, we examine the soil fertility of 12 former arable fields afforested either 10 or 60-70 years ago with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and adjacent sites that have been forested continuously. Volumetric soil samples were collected from the organic soil layer and from mineral soil to a depth of 40 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for pH, bulk density, organic matter content and amounts of nutrients (Kjeldahl N, extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and B). On afforested fields, amounts of nutrients in the mineral soil, especially in 10-year-old afforestations, were higher than on continuously forested sites. In the organic layer plus the 0-40 cm soil layer, the 10-year-old afforestations had 68% more N, 41% more P, 83% more K, 252% more Ca, 6% more Mg, 61% more Zn and 33% more B than the continuously forested sites at a comparable soil depth. In the 60-70-year-old afforestations, the differences were significant only for N, Ca and Zn (20% more N, 121% more Ca and 115% more Zn than on the continuously forested sites). The effects of agriculture on amounts of nutrients were most clearly detected in the former plough layer (0-20 cm) of the 10-year-old afforestations and in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the older afforestations. Amounts of nutrients in the organic layer of the afforested sites were lower, but their concentrations were higher than in the continuously forested sites. On the 10-year-old afforestations, the bulk density of the mineral soil tended to be lower and the organic matter content higher than on the continuously forested sites. On both young and old afforestations, soil pH was higher than on the continuously forest sites. According to these results, changes in soil properties caused by agriculture have increased the soil fertility and therefore probably also the site index. The results also suggest that changes in soil properties due to agricultural land use are quite long lasting.","afforestation and land-use change and nutrient regime and soil organic matter and soil properties and ABIES L KARST and ORGANIC-MATTER and PINUS-RADIATA and PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES and OLD-FIELD and FOREST REGROWTH and BETULA-PENDULA and CARBON STORAGE and BULK-DENSITY and SITE INDEX","10.1007/s11104-005-1869-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-1869-4",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

The mean number of recorded woodpecker species peaked at 20 - 40% spruce plantations. The two most common species in the study, the white- backed and the grey- headed woodpeckers are both Red-listed species in Norway and among the rarest woodpeckers in Europe. The white- backed woodpecker preferred plots with higher than average proportions of standing dead trees and deciduous trees, and low proportions of spruce plantations in the plots. The grey-headed woodpecker preferred plots in the western ( coastal) parts of the study area with presence of large aspen Populus tremula trees. Logistic regression models did not reveal any clear threshold values with respect to proportion of spruce plantations in plots, although both woodpecker species were extremely rare in plots with > 60% spruce plantations. We recommend spruce plantations to be kept at moderate levels to ensure viable populations of woodpeckers in western Norway.","coastal pine forest and critical thresholds and Dendrocopos leucotos and Norway and Picus canus and spruce plantations and woodpeckers and DENDROCOPOS-LEUCOTOS and LANDSCAPE and POPULATION and BOREAL and FOOD and Trees","10.1007/s10531-004-6065-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-6065-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

While anchored into legislation, residual or chronic impacts can occur after offset establishment. Advice and best practice on how to approach these impacts is rare. To address this, we reviewed 30 projects based on a systematic review and meta-analysis in freshwater ecosystems dealing with residual or long-term negative impacts to provide application advice for: habitat creation, habitat restoration, and biological and chemical manipulation. Project information was obtained through Boolean search terms and web-scraping. Habitat creation projects had a pooled effect size of 0.8 and offsetting ratios of 1:5 with high biomass increases of >140% compared to pre-establishment, associated with them. Habitat restoration projects targeted a wide range of species and communities with a pooled effect size of 0.66, offset ratios ranging from 1:1.2 to 1:4.6, and biomass increases generally > 100% compared to pre-restoration. Biological manipulation had the lowest effect size (0.51) with stocking being highly variable both in terms of biomass benefits and project outcomes pointing towards being mostly applicable in cases of direct fish harm not related to habitat aspects. We conclude that (1) all three assessed approaches have a potential application use for offsetting residual or chronic harm with approach-specific caveats. (2) Implementation costs differ across offset methods, with connectivity and side-channel projects having the lowest biomass gain per area costs (3) Time to first benefits required one to two years with time lags needing to be accounted for in the implementation and monitoring process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aquatic Ecosystems and Compensation and Meta-analysis and Mitigation and Residual harm and Systematic Review and Animals and Biodiversity and Biomass and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Fishes and Fresh Water and Aquatic ecosystems and Chemical analysis and Fish and Project management and Restoration and Water and fresh water and Anthropogenic impacts and Effect size and Freshwater fishes and Habitat creation and Habitat restoration and aquatic ecosystem and biomass and fish and freshwater ecosystem and habitat management and literature review and meta-analysis and mitigation and strategic approach and aquatic environment and article and compensation and effect size and freshwater environment and freshwater fish and habitat and human and meta analysis and nonhuman and systematic review and animal and biodiversity and ecosystem and environmental protection","10.1007/s00267-022-01703-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-022-01703-x",NA,NA,"Global","Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

In Norway, some 2.2 million sheep graze on outlying pastures during summer, most of them in the alpine zone, but no study has reported the relative impact of sheep grazing on invertebrate communities relative to other environmental factors such as the plant community and altitude. A fully replicated landscape-scale experiment (2.7 km(2)) was performed with no, low (25 per km(2)) and high (80 per km(2)) sheep densities in an alpine habitat of Norway (1050-1300 in a.s.l.). The increased vulnerability hypothesis (HI) predicts that the more folivorous invertebrates, the higher the grazing pressure by sheep, as large herbivore grazing may stress the plants so they are more vulnerable to insect herbivory. The increased defence hypothesis (H-2) predicts increased levels of general anti-herbivore defences, and thus a lower abundance of invertebrates with increasing sheep densities. Contrary to both predictions, no evidence was found that sheep grazing affected invertebrate richness, or abundance of folivorous, predatory or detritivore invertebrates - in a community dominated by Diptera and Hemiptera. Demonstrating an effect will always be a function of sample size, but at least our study shows that other environmental variables (such as plant species richness and functional plant richness) are more important determinants than sheep grazing for the selected invertebrate groups. Our study was short-term (first year of grazing) mainly designed to test specific hypotheses related to induced plant defences; long-term effects are probably owing to the impact sheep may have on vegetation composition, primary production, litter cover and soil properties.","sheep and grazing and Diptera and Hemiptera and alpine ecosystem and TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and INSECT DIVERSITY and DEER and BIODIVERSITY and ASSEMBLAGES and RESPONSES and VARIABILITY and POPULATIONS and ARTHROPODS","10.1017/S0952836905007107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0952836905007107",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

We applied systematic review and meta-analytical methods to robustly assess evidence on the impact of matrix structure on movement rates, with the hypothesis that movement will be greater through matrix of a more similar structure (vegetation height and cover) to the home habitat. Twenty studies of movement through two or more different matrix types provided 107 effect sizes, expressing the difference between the relative movement rates in different matrix types. The studies were all on animals, including relatively mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies but also rodents and amphibians. We were able to detect that on average, movement was greater through matrix of a more similar structure to the species' habitat despite the variation in studies in terms of matrix types, species and methods. The effect size was larger when there was a greater difference in the structure of the two matrix types being compared (e.g. comparing grassland to forest rather than short grass to long grass). However, there was a high degree of covariation between matrix contrast and studies and other significant subgroupings such as taxonomic group and matrix openness. The biological significance of the increase in movement is not clear; however, ecological theory predicts dispersing individuals are important for population dynamics. Changes to the structure of landscapes intended to improve permeability to movement are supported by the findings of this study, particularly for relatively mobile species. However, research over longer timescales, greater distances and range of taxonomic groups is necessary.","Connectivity and Emigration and Dispersal and Permeability and Resistance and Risk ratio and CLIMATE-CHANGE and LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY and HABITAT AREA and DISPERSAL and CONSERVATION and DYNAMICS and BEHAVIOR and FOREST and DECISIONS and RESPONSES","10.1007/s10980-012-9781-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-012-9781-9",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Because the land area available for tree planting may serve multiple purposes, striking the right balance between climate goals and other objectives is crucial. We conducted a survey of the Norwegian population to investigate potential land-use conflicts that may arise from executing a large-scale afforestation programme. Respondents were presented with three land-use alternatives to replace formerly grazed agricultural land. We used manipulated landscape photos to elicit their underlying value orientations. We combined multiple correspondence analysis with latent class regression models to reveal preference heterogeneity. Our models grouped respondents into three latent classes, with 24%, 24% and 52%, respectively, expressing a preference for forest carbon sequestration, recreation or agriculture as the most crucial land-use function to be retained. Birth year emerged as a strong predictor of class membership. Specifically, generations born before 1970 were more inclined to support the continuation of agricultural landscapes, while those born in 1980 and later showed a stronger inclination towards natural forest succession for carbon sequestration or recreational purposes. Quantitatively, every 10-year reduction in age increased the odds of a respondent belonging to the forestation or recreation class (relative to the agricultural class) by a factor of 2. Interestingly, even among respondents who were classified as most climate concerned, natural forests were 50% more likely to be preferred over monoculture spruce plantation as a policy option. This suggests that there may be public resistance to spruce planting for climate mitigation purposes in Norway. © 2023, The Author(s).","Carbon sequestration and Finite-mixture model and Land-use preferences and Latent class regression and Multiple correspondence analysis and Public perception and Norway and Carbon and Climate change and Reforestation and Regression analysis and Agricultural landscapes and Finite mixture modeling and Forest carbon sequestration and Land-use preference and Latent class and Natural forests and afforestation and age structure and carbon sequestration and climate change and correspondence analysis and forest cover and mitigation and monoculture and plantation and reforestation and succession and tree planting and Land use and Trees","10.1007/s10584-023-03588-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03588-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

The path scenarios were depicted as digitally calibrated photos that systematically displayed physical path feature in boreal, semi-natural settings.

"236","rayyan-674263507","Testing mechanistic modeling to assess impacts of biomass removal","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","The impacts that stand treatments have on carbon, nitrogen and water cycles is a key question relating the sustainability of forests to individual forest management decisions. While the response of the above ground carbon cycle may be relatively easy to measure and is well understood, e.g. volume growth response due to thinning, the impact of stand treatment and different harvesting scenarios on the water, and nutritional status of the remaining trees and site as well as on the below ground carbon and nitrogen cycle is much more difficult to assess due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable data. An alternative that eliminates the need for detailed site-specific data is to use existing models that were explicitly designed for studying biogeochemical processes. In this paper we test and evaluate the applicability of a species-specific mechanistic biogeochemical model to assess the impact of different harvesting scenarios after thinning. Data are available from 36 Norway spruce stands covering three regions each with three harvesting scenarios after thinning and four replications. The different harvesting scenarios applied are: (1) whole tree harvest, (2) whole tree harvest after one vegetation period, i.e. without needles, and (3) commercial stem wood harvest. The modeling results suggest that the variant 3 exhibited the highest growth efficiency, a measure of net carbon uptake or growth, versus all other harvesting methods. This is confirmed by the available field observations. Nitrogen, an indicator of nutrient supply, behaved similarly. The important exception was nitrogen plant uptake, which was lower immediately after thinning on the sites where the lowest amount of biomass was removed. Significant relationships exist between observed versus modeled stand volume and volume growth suggesting that mechanistic modeling is a suitable diagnostic tool for analyzing the impacts of different management practices and thus, such models can be efficiently used to enhance silvicultural decision-making.

Harvest management requires knowledge of whether the harvest is sustainable as a result of compensatory mechanisms, such as dispersal. The effect of recreational harvesting on dispersal patterns in willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus was assessed over four hunting seasons in central Norway. 2. A two-parameter Weibull model was fitted to the observed absolute dispersal distance data using maximum likelihood methods. Estimates of the scale and shape parameters for the dispersal probability distribution were calculated, describing the distribution of observed willow ptarmigan dispersal distances. From the parameter estimates of the dispersal model we estimated the standard deviation of the dispersal displacement relevant for population genetic and spatial population dynamic models. 3. The effect of harvesting on dispersal patterns was examined by testing for differences in the scale and shape parameters of dispersal distance distributions in areas with and without harvest. No effect of harvesting was found, either in adults or juveniles. 4. Breeding dispersal of adult birds was estimated as a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 402 m and shape parameter b = 2.01, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation of sigma = 284 m. The dispersal probability distribution of adults was not significantly different from a bivariate normal distribution. 5. Natal dispersal had a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 4206 m and shape parameter b = 1.16, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation sigma = 3728 m. The dispersal probability distribution of juveniles was not significantly different from an exponential distribution. 6. Synthesis and applications. Reduction of the population density of willow ptarmigan through harvesting at moderate densities does not seem to affect the dispersal distances. Thus, if there is little or no difference in the dispersal probability distribution in harvested and non-harvested areas there will be only weak or no compensation for the harvest, given that natural mortality and reproduction is the same in both areas. Thus, erroneously assuming compensation of harvest by immigration into a local population can lead to overharvest.",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01031.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01031.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Such insight is necessary to understand landscape community dynamics and resilience. We compared bryophyte (liverworts and mosses) communities in matched 0.02-ha plots of four boreal stand types in central Sweden: recently clear-felled and mature stands dominated by Norway spruce in south-facing and north-facing slopes. Differences between forests and clear-cuts were interpreted as effects of clear-cutting, and differences between south- and north-facing slopes as effects of aspect. In response to clear-cutting, bryophyte cover and composition changed more in south-facing slopes. Only one out of ten significantly declining species in south- facing slopes also declined significantly in north-facing slopes. North-facing slopes lost fewer bryophyte species, and among those, fewer forest species and fewer species associated with wood and bark. In north-facing slopes, the average proportions of mosses and liverworts shared between the forest and the clear-cut plot were 88% and 74%, respectively. Corresponding numbers for south- facing slopes were 79% and 33%. In addition, more bryophyte species were added in north-than south- facing slopes after clear-cutting, somewhat reducing the difference in compositional change between aspects. South- and north-facing mature forests differed in species composition, mostly due to higher richness of mosses in south- facing slopes. The smaller changes in bryophyte communities on north-facing slopes in response to clear- cutting have implications for ecosystem dynamics and management as high local survival may enhance landscape-level resilience.","clear-cutting and disturbance and forest and habitat quality and liverworts and mosses and resilience and slope and species composition and stability and BRYOPHYTE MOSS and DISTURBANCE and RESILIENCE and MICROCLIMATE and GROWTH and DIVERSITY and ECOSYSTEM and RICHNESS and CANOPY and NUMBER and Trees","10.1890/06-0613     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/06-0613",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

We found higher diet diversity in the forest-dominated landscape, but we also found high dietary overlap, presumably due to the dominance of thrushes in both areas.

Our aim was to identify whether forest disturbance history was an important factor controlling the variation in average plant performance. We used three measures of forest maturity (maturity class, tree biomass and number of trees) as variables reflecting disturbance history. These variables were used in our analysis together with measured environmental conditions (soil moisture, pH, nitrogen, and elevation) a priori known to affect plant performance. To quantify plant performance, we used multiple measures of the local V. myrtillus populations, including percentage cover, average ramet age, height, diameter, biomass, growth, and sexual reproduction (number of fruits and number of mature seeds per fruit). Most of the explained variation in our performance variables could be related to our environmental variables, but disturbance history was also an important determinant of the performance of V. myrtillus. All performance variables were higher in younger, less mature stands, except ramet age, which was highest in mature stands. The increase in performance after clear cutting indicates that this period is of high importance for the population dynamics and persistence of V. myrtillus in intensively managed boreal forest landscapes.

Basic knowledge of the stump fauna is necessary to e.g. assess the value of other dead wood, such as high stumps created for conservation purposes. This study focuses on early arriving bark- and wood-boring beetles and associated insect enemies (predatory Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and parasitic Hymenoptera) in fresh stumps of Norway spruce Picea abies. Ordinary low stumps were compared with mechanically created 4 m high stumps. Wood samples for insect rearing were cut from low (n = 28) and high stumps (n = 21) on five one-summer-old clearcuts in Sweden. High stumps were sampled at the base and at 1.5 m above ground. All emerging insects were determined to species or genus level. Proportion of stumps inhabited, density and Shannon's index for diversity and evenness were calculated. At least 17 phloem/fungivorus (predominately Scolytidae and Cerambycidae) and 8 predatory beetle taxa (mostly Cleridae and Nitidulidae) were recorded, as well as 9 parasitoid taxa (Pteromalidae, Eurytomidae and Braconidae) associated with bark beetle hosts. Most taxa occurred in both low and high stumps. High stumps were slightly better for parasitoids in terms of occupancy, density and index values. Phloem/fungivorus and predatory beetles occurred in nearly all low and high stumps (93-95%), whereas parasitoids were more often recorded at 1.5 m in high stumps (95%) than in the base (48%) or in low stumps (54%). Three parasitoid species occurred in significantly higher densities in high stumps than in low stumps (Rhopalicus quadratus, Rhopalicus tutela and Dendrosoter niiddendorffi). The results show that above-ground parts of fresh spruce stumps to a high degree may serve as habitat for secondary and mostly harmless bark beetles. They also barbour generalist predators and parasitoids, including important enemies of forest pests such as the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The results support previous studies showing positive effects of high stumps on insect biodiversity, and suggest that also hi-her trophic levels such as parasitic Hymenoptera are favoured.

In 1986 five circular forest fragments (1/16-1 ha) were exposed through clearcutting within an old-growth Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in northern Sweden. Initial responses to fragmentation (1986-1991) showed very high tree mortality and structural degradation of the fragments. In the present study we re-inventoried these fragments to evaluate tree mortality patterns and structural changes occurring over a longer time period (1991-2004). The fragments can readily be viewed as harvest retention patches or 'woodland key habitats' (i.e., set-aside patches of high conservation value), allowing us to make inferences about the effectiveness of these novel conservation tools. Tree mortality rates dropped markedly (to 1.2-3.9%/year) compared to the initial. responses, yet remained elevated over those of control plots in the nearby unfragmented forest (0.7%). Mortality increased with tree diameter, resulting in smaller-diameter, more homogenous stands. Mortality also generally increased with decreasing fragment size and was dependent of tree location within fragments. Standing death (45% of dead trees, 19912004) replaced uprootings (71%, 1986-1991) as the dominant mode of mortality. Numbers of dying and standing dead trees increased during the second sampling period, further adding to structural change and reduced stand density. Elevated tree mortality resulted in uncharacteristically high volumes of coarse woody debris. Results clearly show that adverse edge-related changes to forest structure and function persist up to two decades after fragmentation. Fragments of this size largely fail as remnants intended to maintain forest interior conditions and late-successional forest structure. However, when embedded within a harvested landscape, they: (1) provide abundant coarse woody debris and snags for deadwood-dependent species that risk extirpation in the surrounding matrix and (2) retain important structures for the developing stands.

Slash is already being harvested for biofuel purposes, and stumps are an even bigger potential source of wood fuel. Both substrates constitute a major component of dead wood in man aged forests, but have been poorly studied in terms of lichen diversity. We compared lichen species diversity between the lateral surface of slash and the cut surface of stumps of Norway spruce in planted boreonemoral Swedish forests of four age classes; 4 - 5, 8 - 9, 12 - 13, and 16 - 18 years. We also estimated the amounts of the two substrates, and discriminated between slash with bark and decorticated slash. There were no differences in species num ber per surface area, but slash had more species when equal volumes were compared. We found compositional differences between slash and stumps throughout the decay process. The majority of species found on both substrates were more frequent on stumps, which also had a higher number of unique species and species in the literature indicated as nationally rare or uncommon. The volume per hectare of stumps was ten times greater than that of slash but conversely, the lateral surface area of slash was five times greater than the cut surface area of stumps. Few dead wood specialist lichen species were, however, strictly associated with slash, whereas stumps offer a more heterogeneous environment and may provide important habitats for rare lichens in the managed forest landscape.

Therefore, hydropower electricity production can contribute to combat climate change challenges. However, hydropower electricity production may at the same time contribute to environmental impacts and has been characterized as a large water consumer with impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Life Cycle Assessment is not yet able to assess the biodiversity impact of water consumption from hydropower electricity production on a global scale. The first step to assess these biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment is to quantify the water consumption per kWh energy produced. We calculated catchment-specific net water consumption values for Norway ranging between 0 and 0.012 m(3)/kWh. Further, we developed the first characterization factors for quantifying the aquatic biodiversity impacts of water consumption in a post-glaciated region. We apply our approach to quantify the biodiversity impact per kWh Norwegian hydropower electricity. Our results vary over six orders of magnitude and highlight the importance of a spatial explicit approach. This study contributes to assessing the biodiversity impacts of water consumption globally in Life Cycle Assessment.","Life Cycle Impact Assessment and Hydropower reservoir and Water consumption and Fish and Characterization factor and Species-discharge relationship and SPECIES-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS and GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS and POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION and FISH and FLOW and FRAMEWORK and RICHNESS and EVAPORATION and CONSEQUENCES and CONNECTIVITY","10.1016/j.eiar.2018.12.002     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.12.002",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Conceptual work / scenarios"

Here, we explore the biodiversity quality and conservation relevance of three categories of set-asides dominated by Norway spruce (nature reserves, woodland key habitats and retention patches, i.e. groups of living trees left on clear-cut areas) and a non set-aside forest category (old managed spruce forests) in a boreal forest region in central Sweden. The comparisons are based on surveys of (1) dead wood volumes, (2) diversity of dead wood types in terms of tree species, decomposition stage, diameter and presence of bark and (3) occurrence of saproxylic (i.e. wood dependent) beetles in Norway spruce, Picea abies. For saproxylic beetles, species richness, species composition and occurrence of red-listed species were compared. In total 180 dead wood types and 129 beetle species were found, 12 of which were red-listed. We found no significant difference between the forest categories in terms of total dead wood volume. However, the rarefied number of dead wood types was significantly greater in reserves and key habitats compared to retention patches. Woodland key habitats had significantly more beetle species than retention patches and old managed forests, as well as significantly more red-listed species than the retention patches. The species composition of retention patches, differed significantly from that of old managed forests and reserves, probably due to higher degrees of sun-exposure. We conclude that the conservation strategies explored in this study, provide valuable habitats and contribute differently to the preservation of old forests and saproxylic beetles. We would add that inventories, to identify conservation values, should be carried out prior to harvest of old stands and that measures should be taken accordingly to set-aside the parts of forest stands with the highest biodiversity values.

To minimise the cost of this action trees of low quality, e.g. rotten trees, are chosen if possible. In this study we investigated if the wood decay fungi Heterobasidion spp. affects saproxylic beetles assemblages in Norway spruce (Picea abies) high-stumps. In total we caught 43 species of saproxylic beetles (Coleoptera) of which one was red-listed. Associations with the fungi were tested on 13 beetle species and three of them showed negative associations with the occurrence of Heterobasidion, while none of the tested species showed a positive association with Heterobasidion. Species richness did not differ between infected (30) and non-infected (33) stumps, but the beetle assemblages differed to some extent. Two additional bracket fungi species were found on some of the high-stumps, Fomitopsis pinicola and Trichaptum spp. Both these fungi had beetle species significantly associated with them. Interestingly, we found that F pinicola and Trichaptum spp. never occurred together in the same stumps. None of them, however, seemed to be affected by presence of Heterobasidion spp. In conclusion, Heterobasidion spp. infections influence the beetle fauna by disfavouring some beetle species but we did not find any species positively associated with Heterobasidion spp. This suggests that increasing the proportion of pre-rotten high-stumps could have a negative effect on beetle diversity on clear-cuts.

Fertilising young stands of Norway spruce in Sweden have shown to increase tree growth by more than 200%. Fertilisation, however, also has other effects on forest ecosystems. Here, we studied the response of the species composition of forest-floor vegetation to three different frequencies of fertilisation in young stands of Norway spruce. Fertiliser was applied every year, every second year or every third year. The total amount of N ranged from 425 kg ha(-1) to 625 kg ha(-1), in combination with P, K. Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Zi, B and Cu. The largest effects of the fertilisation were found among bryophytes and lichens, which lost substantial cover. Unexpectedly, Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly known to be favoured by fertilisation, was negatively affected. Species that increased in frequency were Oxalis acetosella, Brachythecium sp. and Plagiothecium sp. Decreased availability of light, as an indirect effect of fertilisation through increased tree canopy cover, was found to be the most important factor behind the change in species composition of vascular plants. The total cover of bryophytes, however, did not show any significant response to the changes in canopy cover, indicating that the effects seen in this group may be a result of more direct effects of the fertiliser. Few significant differences were found between the two most intensive fertilisation frequencies, although fertilisation every third year was often distinguished from both the control and the other fertilised treatments. Even though the effects at the stand level were substantial, the effects on biodiversity and function of ecosystems on a landscape or regional level need further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While the habitat value of treefall pits for plants is relatively well known, the characteristic exposed root-plates of treefall mounds, which may require different management, have received less attention. The aim of the current study was to explore key factors of lichen incidence and their community characteristics on root-plates. We mapped and described treefall mounds in 24 stands (2 ha each) in a balanced design representing mixed stands of two site types (mesotrophic; drained swamp) and two management types (old growth, mature commercial forest) in hemiboreal Estonia. First, the occurrence of any lichens and of a specialized pin lichen, Chaenotheca furfuracea, was recorded on all 1207 mounds found. According to multi-level logistic regression models, their incidence depended on every mound-scale variable tested: there were independent positive effects of root-plate area and treefall age, spruce treefall, and the absence of exposed pit. In contrast, weak stand-scale effects only appeared when their interactions with mound-scale variables were included or some main effects were eliminated. C. furfuracea also occurred more frequently where other inhabited root-plates were nearby, and such dispersal limitation interacted with habitat quality. Secondly, full lichen communities were described in detail on a subsample of 84 root-plates of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Altogether 48 lichen species were recorded, including eight red-listed or nationally rare species. The communities on large fresh root-plates and in mature drained stands had distinct species composition, while communities of older mounds and in old-growth stands converged in species composition. We conclude that lichen incidence on root-plates is mostly determined by colonization probability, and commercial forests can support a diverse lichen biota when large treefall mounds, particularly of P. abies and of >10 years age are provided. However, given some differences of lichen communities in old growth, and because treefall issues conflict with other management objectives in commercial forests, optimised management of treefall areas there should be complemented by their strict protection in reserves.

We investigated the immediate effects of two series of forest management treatments, which produce timber and forest chips, on the volume and decay classes of coarse woody debris (CWD). One of the treatment series included logging and residue harvesting (LRH) and mounding (M), while the other series included LRH and mounding combined with stump harvesting (MSH). We hypothesized that, i) LRH reduces CWD, excluding stumps; ii) the more intense the soil preparation treatment is, M vs. MSH, the more CWD is destroyed; iii) both LRH and soil preparation treatments (M and MSH) reduce the occurence of snags, highly decayed CWD and deciduous CWD in particular. Ten sample plots in mature managed Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) dominated forests were located in Southern Finland. The total volume of CWD on the sample plots was measured three times: before and after LRH, and after M or MSH. LRH significantly decreased the volume of snags and the combined volume of snags and logs. MSH significantly decreased the total volume of CWD, while M had no significant effect on the volume of CWD.

Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference - between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this. 2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty. 3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density. 4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, -including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programmes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.",NA,"10.1111/1365-2664.12992","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12992",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational and simulations"

Our results show that fertilized stands had 38% more species and 21% more individuals than unfertilized stands. Compared with stands under traditional management, the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds. We cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers. Future studies should focus on structural and compositional effects of fertilization processes during the entire rotation period and at assessing its effects in a landscape context.","Intensive forestry and Fertilization and Birds and Biodiversity and Norway spruce and NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION and BIRD PREDATION and COMMUNITY and RESPONSES and GROWTH and Norway and Trees and Self-Fertilization","10.1007/s13280-011-0137-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0137-5",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

The components of the net carbon exchange include the uptake of carbon into biomass, the decomposition of litter and humus, emissions from forest management operations and carbon released from the combustion of biomass and degradation of wood-based products. The tool enables the allocation of the total carbon emissions to the timber and energy biomass and to the energy produced on the basis of biomass. In example computations, ecosystem model simulations were utilized as an input to the tool. We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland. In our examples, the emissions allocated for the energy from biomass in southern Finland were 172 and 188 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in the current climate and in a CC, respectively, and 199 and 157 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in northern Finland. This study concludes that the tool is suitable for estimating the net carbon exchange of forest production. The tool also enables the allocation of direct and indirect carbon emissions, related to forest production over its life cycle, in different environmental conditions and for alternative time periods and land uses. Simulations of forest management regimes together with the CC give new insights into ecologically sustainable forest bioenergy and timber production, as well as climate change mitigation options in boreal forests.","bioenergy and calculation tool and carbon balance and decomposition and ecosystem and life cycle and sustainability and GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS and CLIMATE-CHANGE and TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY and NORWAY SPRUCE and CARBON STOCKS and SOIL and BIOFUELS and ENERGY and TIMBER and MANAGEMENT","10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01101.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01101.x",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi. We therefore suggest a conservation strategy for preserving old-growth forests and establishing protected forest stands to enhance structural heterogeneity in spruce-dominated forests. For this, a careful screening of protected areas throughout Europe is necessary to provide managers with guidelines for conservation.","Wood-decaying fungi and Low mountain range and Old-growth forests and Bark beetle and Generalized linear models and Additive partitioning and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and DEAD WOOD and POLYPOROUS FUNGI and INHABITING FUNGI and BOREAL FORESTS and NORWAY SPRUCE and KEY HABITATS and MANAGEMENT and ALPHA and COLONIZATION and Mountaineering and Trees and Fungi","10.1007/s10531-011-0159-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0159-0",10.4261714274308,51.0830453980048,"Germany",NA,NA

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

The process-based growth model is built on fundamental ecological theories of photosynthesis, tree structure and competition between trees. Because of the sound theoretical basis the validity of the optimization results is not restricted to a limited set of states determined by the boundaries of empirical data. The detailed structure of the growth model enables the inclusion of timber quality and its dependence on the size and quality of branches. The optimized variables include the initial stand density, the number, type and intensity of thinnings and the rotation period. The results yield a detailed and coherent picture of optimal stand level management. Comparing the optimal solutions with silvicultural practices suggests that the latter are based on unoptimal thinnings, too low stand density and too long rotation periods.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).","Ecosystem model and Emission calculation and Energy wood production and Management and Boreal ecosystem and GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS and NORWAY SPRUCE STANDS and SCOTS PINE and CARBON SEQUESTRATION and CLIMATE-CHANGE and SIMULATION-MODEL and ROTATION LENGTH and BIOMASS ENERGY and FOREST BIOMASS and GROWTH","10.1007/s10342-011-0539-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-011-0539-8",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

We studied the effects of forest fuel harvesting on decomposer fungi on clear-cut Norway spruce stands in central Finland. The number of occurrences and taxa of polypores, saprotrophic agarics and pleurotoid agarics were determined on 10 forest fuel harvested and 10 control clear-cuts 4-5 years after logging. In total, we recorded 148 fungal taxa. The total number of taxa, the number of polypore occurrences, and the number of polypore species within small area were lower at forest fuel harvested sites. The effect on the number of saprotrophic agaric taxa became obvious with increasing area. Most of the common polypore species had fewer occurrences on forest fuel harvested sites while the commonest agaric species increased due to forest fuel harvesting. Concerning different dead wood types, there were fewer fungal species and occurrences on stumps and fewer occurrences on logs on forest fuel harvested sites. Most of the effects of forest fuel harvesting were explained by the reduction in resource availability. We conclude that forest fuel harvesting, especially stump removal, has negative effects on decomposer fungi and that there is a risk that populations of certain species still thriving in managed forests will decline in the future.

This is mainly due to poor ecological stability, low economic performance, and decrease in biodiversity in existing forests. In this study, we analysed the simultaneous transformation of adjacent even-aged stands (a forest division) into mixed conifer/broadleaved stands. The case area is found in a conifer-dominated Danish forest and consists primarily of Norway spruce, European beech, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. An economic evaluation of several transformation strategies was carried out by simulation. An area based combined Markov chain and Dynamic yield table model was used. Analyses were conducted under risk of wind throw. Strategies were defined by length of the cutting cycle and the diameter class harvest volume proportions of each tree species. As a reference point, an optimal strategy was determined using strict target diameter harvesting. It was assumed that such a regime would not achieve the desired change in stand structure due to the narrow diameter distributions of the existing stands as well as the present forest structure. Two groups of harvest strategies were analysed: passive strategies entailing harvesting mature and over-mature trees, and active strategies entailing harvest of immature, mature and over-mature trees; and three lengths of cutting cycles were applied: 2, 5 and 8 years. A transformation period of 80 years was assumed for the entire forest division. The importance of the local forest conditions was evident: for all strategies, an economically over-mature forest structure resulted in large harvest income at the beginning of transformation, leading to small differences between the strategies and thus increasing flexibility in the choice of strategy. When trees were harvested before or after economic maturity, opportunity costs depended on strategy. Such costs must be taken into account when forcing a fast transformation, e.g. for biological or recreational reasons. For the worst performing strategy, the overall loss was 34% compared with the optimal strategy in terms of total expectation value. Regarding area distribution of tree species and size classes, the differences between strategies were insignificant at the end of the transformation period. The active strategies with a 2-year cutting cycle were the least vulnerable to wind throw but had the lowest economic performances, emphasising the trade-off between vulnerability and operational costs (entry costs).

Increased modeling of urban forest structure and function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the similarities and differences between modeling techniques and applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales, compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met, computational fluid dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors. Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem services.

The growth and development of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) stands on a fertile site (Oxalis-myrtillus) in central Finland (Joensuu region: 6239?N, 2937?E) was simulated for two consecutive rotation periods (80+80years/160years). Stemwood and energy biomass production, carbon sequestration, and average storage and emission dynamics related to the entire production process of biomass were assessed. The assessment was done by employing a life cycle assessment tool, which combines simulation outputs from an ecosystem model and the related technosystem emissions. It was found that stump and root harvesting constituted 21-36% of the total biomass production (energy biomass and stemwood) depending on the thinning regimes and rotation period. No considerable effect was found in stemwood production when stump and root extraction was compared to the regime in which stumps and roots were left at the site. Stump and root extraction did not affect carbon sequestration on the following rotation and, in fact, an increase in forest growth was found for the unthinned and 30% increased thresholds compared to the first rotation. The results also showed that if current thinning threshold is increased, win-win situations are possible, especially when climate change mitigation is the main concern. The substitution of coal with energy biomass is possible without reducing carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. The utilization of energy biomass, including stumps and roots, instead of coal could reduce up to 33% of emissions over two rotation periods depending on the thinning regimes. Even if stumps and roots were excluded, a maximum of 19% carbon emissions could be reduced by using only logging residues.","carbon sequestration and carbon stock and climatic impact and life cycle assessment and stump harvest and substitution and thinning regime and ENERGY WOOD PRODUCTION and CLIMATE-CHANGE and SCOTS PINE and TIMBER PRODUCTION and CO2 EMISSIONS and MANAGEMENT and GROWTH and IMPACTS and MODEL and STOCKS and Norway","10.1111/gcbb.12010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12010",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

Management of polypore diversity requires species-specific information about their occurrence probabilities, which partially depend on stand dead wood availability and other properties. We implemented an ensemble of polypore habitat models to simulations of stand and dead wood availability estimated with a decomposition model we fitted to data. We asked how management of a boreal Norway spruce stand influences the dead wood availability and polypore occurrence probabilities and their diversity. Simulations of multiple polypore species with stand management scenarios provided insight to dead wood dynamics and polypore species management. In a managed stand, diversity thrived after final harvesting, but declined to low level by mid-rotation. Harvest residues and stumps, although low quality substrate for many species, were important for diversity in young managed stand due to their high quantities. High mixtures of naturalness in stand management were required to elevate diversity of managed spruce stands from the mid-rotation lows to levels in natural-like stands. Our study suggests that dead-wood supply of managed stands could be optimised to lift lowest species expectations towards levels in natural-like forests, but it seems that reaching these levels requires deadwood quantities much higher than provided by conventional management. Management of stand diversity can presumably be facilitated with wise landscape planning but more research is needed in order to incorporate polypores to spatio-temporal management simulation context.

Arthropod sampling was conducted in 15 differently aged stands using pitfall traps, with environmental variables monitored concurrently. A total of 66 spider, 29 ground beetle, 12 centipede, 8 millipede and 3 woodlice species were determined. In general, litter depth, herb cover, canopy closure and the amount of coarse woody debris had the greatest influence on assemblage composition in all groups. Spider community composition, being more stenotopic than other arthropod groups, was affected by the highest number of factors. A closer association with site conditions in spiders and ground beetles was manifested by a marked differentiation in the occurrence of forest and open-habitat species in the youngest (open) and oldest (closed) stands, though neither the total species number nor abundance differed significantly throughout stand development. Contrary to arthropod assemblages, significant relationships between ecological groups and environmental variables were identified only in several cases. Centipede diversity (as defined by biodiversity indices) was significantly higher in 30-35-year-old stands. Appropriate intervention in homogenous spruce stands may help increase habitat availability for most epigeic arthropods, thus enhancing, or at least maintaining, biodiversity within such habitats.

These storage piles may become a trap for saproxylic insects (dependent on dead wood) if they attract many breeding individuals, whose offspring are killed at biofuel processing. Stumps in clear-cuts are also an important habitat for many species and these species could be negatively affected by habitat loss when stumps are extracted. In a field study, we therefore estimated the trap effect for the saproxylic beetle fauna in stump storage piles. We also estimated the habitat loss and population decrease that was the result of stump extraction. Beetle density and habitat amounts were estimated in stump storage piles, extraction clear-cuts, and ordinary clear-cuts. In each of eight (six for piles) replicates, beetles were sampled from ten Norway spruce Picea abies stumps, by means of bark sieving, in each habitat (220 stumps in total). Stump extraction reduced the P. abies stump volume by 76%. The concomitant decrease in beetle community abundance was 70%, a decrease from 9109 to 2692 beetles per hectare. A conservative estimate is that between 5.2% and 23.1% of the beetles ""produced"" at the stump extraction site were killed at stump pile removal. Our results indicated that the stump storage piles were a severe ecological trap for four individual species. However, a lower community density of beetles in stump storage piles compared to surrounding extraction clear-cuts, indicate that stump storage piles did not constitute a community-wide ecological trap.

Stump extraction for bio energy is a new forestry activity and before large-scale implementation occurs, it is important to analyse its consequences. Saproxylic beetles depend on dead trees and stump extraction will reduce the amount of habitat available for this group. 2. Early warning signs of impending regional species extinctions were looked for in areas where stump harvest has only been conducted for about 3years. In a paired design (N=8), the beetle fauna was sampled in stumps on ordinary clear-cuts and on clear-cuts from which stumps had been extracted. Sampling in extraction clear-cuts was possible because 25% of the stump volume was retained. Samples were collected by bark sieving ten Norway spruce, Picea abies, stumps per clear-cut. 3. In total, 6959 individuals of 46 species were found. Several early warning signs were seen: stump extraction reduced the number of species per stump and per clear-cut and reduced the species evenness in individual stumps. 4. Species at higher trophic levels (predators and fungivores), in particular, suffered negative effects. Stump extraction reduced the number of species of fungivores and facultative predators/fungivores at the clear-cut level and reduced the relative abundance of predators at the stump level. 5. These results indicate that if stumps are extracted from a high proportion of the clear-cuts in a region, the present recommendations of leaving 15-25% of the stump volume will be insufficient for preserving the beetle fauna in the stumps. Further studies are needed to identify levels of stump retention that do not lead to species loss.","Bio energy and biodiversity and community ecology and species abundance distribution and HABITAT REQUIREMENTS and FOREST FRAGMENTATION and HARVESTING STUMPS and SPECIES RICHNESS and LOGGING RESIDUES and DEAD WOOD and LOGS and ASSEMBLAGES and SPRUCE and BIODIVERSITY","10.1111/icad.12005     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/icad.12005",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

To reduce the amount of soil disturbance, it is recommended to retain stumps in wet areas. We wanted to evaluate if that strategy is beneficial also for saproxylic (wood-living) insects, which will have less habitat to breed in at stump harvest, and therefore also need mitigation. We tested if stumps in wet positions on a clear-cut harbour fewer species and a different assemblage of saproxylic insects than do stumps in dry positions. Insects were reared out from wood pieces taken from 100 stumps (50 Norway spruce, Picea abies and 50 birch, Betula spp.) sampled in pairs: one stump from wet and one from dry soil in each pair. In the lab 2201 individuals representing 49 beetle and 6 moth species were encountered. Fewer species were found in spruce stumps on wet soil than on dry soil, both when measured per stump or as an accumulated value over all stumps within the categories. No difference was detected between the number of species found in wet and dry birch stumps. However, three beetle species that live mainly in birch were more common in dry stumps than in wet. No species showed an association with wet stumps. We conclude that stumps in wet positions form an inferior habitat to stumps in dry positions, and that this should be considered when making recommendations concerning the harvesting of stumps for bioenergy.

"267","rayyan-674268626","Can thinning alleviate negative effects of fertilization on boreal forest floor vegetation?","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Society's increased interest in renewable energy and materials put pressure on forest biomass production. Intensive fertilization of young Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest has a considerable potential to increase the production of tree biomass, but there are concerns about negative side-effects on forest ecosystem structure and function. Fertilization of young forest has a strong negative impact on light availability below the tree canopy and reduces the abundance of the forest floor vegetation. The silvicultural practice of thinning has been shown to affect composition and diversity of forest floor vegetation, and it has been proposed, but rarely tested, that the effects of fertilization are interdependent on the type of thinning performed. Here we present responses on the forest floor vegetation following 25 years of fertilization and eighth years after thinning (removing 30% or 60% of the tree basal area) in a Norway spruce forest in northern Sweden. Fertilization without thinning led to a considerable reduction in abundance of most forest floor plants. It did not affect species richness but resulted in an increased evenness. Thinning reduced the fertilization effects so that the total abundance of the vegetation was comparable to the unfertilized control plots. A considerable change in species composition had, however, taken place. Thinning favored early-successional species and pteridophytes on the account of dwarf-shrubs. Thinning also increased species richness and functional richness, while none, or negative effects were seen on evenness and functional evenness, respectively. A comparison with data from the National Forest Inventory revealed that the type of vegetation generated by fertilization, without or in combination with thinning, is a type of vegetation very uncommon in Swedish boreal forests. First, we conclude that the effects of fertilization on forest floor vegetation in young stands of Norway spruce are largely dependent on thinning regime. Secondly, fertilization will, independently of thinning, lead to considerable changes in the vegetation, including a functional shift from dwarf-shrubs with ericoid mycorrhiza to ferns and grasses with arbuscular mycorrhiza, resulting in a functional type of vegetation that is rare in this part of the boreal forest biome. Finally, in contrast to what previously has been suggested for unfertilized forests, thinning of fertilized forests may not promote late-successional species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important.

The most common response to this damage is to implement strategies to lower population densities. However, lowering deer density may not always be desirable from hunting, recreational, or conservation perspectives. Therefore, knowledge is needed about additional factors beyond deer density that affect damage levels, and management actions that consider competing management goals. We studied the relationships between levels of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (1) relative deer density indices (pellet group count and deer harvest data), (2) availability of alternative natural forage (cover of forage species) and (3) proportion forest in the landscape, both at a forest stand scale and at a landscape scale. Extensive variation in damage level was evident between the six study areas. On a stand scale, the proportion of spruce damaged was positively related to pellet group density, indicating the importance of local deer usage of stands. In addition, available alternative forage in the field layer within spruce stands and proportion forest surrounding stands was negatively related to damage level. On the landscape scale, damage level was negatively related to availability of forage in the field and shrub layers and proportion forest, but was not related to any of the relative deer density indices. Increasing alternative forage may thus decrease damage and thereby reduce conflicts. Additionally, the proportion of forest in the landscape affects damage levels and should thus be considered in landscape planning and when forecasting damage risk. The relationship between local deer usage of stands and damage level suggests that future studies should try to separate the effects of local deer usage and deer density.","Cervus elaphus and deer management and forest damage and habitat fragmentation and landscape structure and land use conflicts and large herbivores and Norway spruce and Picea abies and red deer and ungulates and WHITE-TAILED DEER and MOOSE ALCES-ALCES and BIALOWIEZA PRIMEVAL FOREST and NORTH TEMPERATE FORESTS and BARK STRIPPING DAMAGE and CERVUS-ELAPHUS and PICEA-ABIES and NORWAY SPRUCE and MANAGEMENT and IMPACTS","10.1890/ES14-00106.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00106.1",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

This study assessed the effects of forest restoration (increasing the amount of decaying wood) on dead wood and wood-decaying fungi. The data were collected from Norway spruce and Scots pine dominated forest stands in Finland that had been used for timber production until they were set aside as reserves. Dead trees and polypore fungi were inventoried five years after restoration and compared with control forests. Altogether, 50 polypore species were found from the study area. Restoration clearly increased the amount of dead wood (11.5 vs. 1.1 m(3)/site) as well as the average number of common polypores (6.6 vs. 2.9 species/site) but no threatened species were found. Variation in the dead wood types (decay stages) was low in the restored sites which probably hinders the occurrence of rare species. Thus, our results suggest that restoring dead wood does not immediately benefit the populations of red-listed and rare polypores, although restoration clearly alters the fungal assemblages. A longer time span is needed until the restored substrates become suitable for most red-listed species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There is an increasing interest in intensifying forestry by also harvesting slash and stumps for biofuel at felling. We evaluated the efficiency of combining intensified forestry production with compensation measures, by estimating the net revenue from slash and stump harvest, the cost of high stump creation, and simulating habitat amount for 680 bark- and wood-living species (fungi, beetles, lichens, and bryophytes) in Norway spruce forests in Sweden under different scenarios of biofuel harvest and compensation. We show that the harvest of slash and stumps has a clear negative effect on the habitat amount available for many species, especially for many fungi and beetles. Combining slash harvesting with the creation of high stumps results in an economic surplus and at the same time provides significantly more habitat in comparison with no slash harvesting and no high stump creation. When undertaking stump harvesting it is currently impossible to achieve such positive effects. Thus, our analyses show that compensation can sometimes be a useful tool when both economic and biodiversity goals must be achieved in forestry, but in other cases it is a better alternative to avoid the activity that causes the negative effects.

In this context, emulations of natural disturbance have become increasingly common as management tools to minimize negative effects of forestry on biodiversity. In a large-scale habitat-restoration experiment conducted in Norway spruce stands in southern Finland, we tested the effects of controlled burning, partial harvesting, and increasing the amount of downed wood on ground beetles (carabids). We also evaluated the effects of moisture gradients within harvested sites. We collected beetles seven years after the treatments. The moisture gradient was the strongest determinant of carabid assemblages and even after the most intense disturbances, the moist patches within sites still supported fauna characteristic of mire habitats. The species richness of carabids and the number of open-habitat associated species peaked on burned and harvested sites but we did not observe a typical pattern in beetle assemblages whereby numbers of rare species and species unique to post-disturbance habitats were elevated. Our findings suggest that (a) the influx of disturbance-associated species was apparently ephemeral and difficult to observe seven years post disturbance, and (b) moist patches within disturbed sites can serve as refugia for many closed-forest associated carabids over the early phases of post-disturbance succession.

Longitudinal data on forest structure in PFAs is uncommon and often from small areas. Here we use data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to study changes in more than 750 000 ha of PFAs over 60 years. Structures important for biodiversity, e.g., number of large trees and the volume of hard deadwood, including both standing and down wood, have more than doubled. The initial volume of deadwood, however, was very low. The overall tree species composition was stable over time, and only among the largest trees were there indications of a shift towards the late successional Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Deadwood increased independent of species, size of wood, and site characteristics. This increase was positively related to the volume of living trees and forest age. We conclude that Swedish PFAs, in the absence of active management and under fire suppression at the landscape scale, develop structural components that are crucial for conservation of biodiversity. However, although tree species composition appears stable, present disturbance regimes in the PFAs are considerably different from those in naturally dynamic forests, which may have implications for long-term biodiversity maintenance.","national park and nature reserve and temporal trends and forest dynamics and coarse woody debris and COARSE WOODY DEBRIS and NATURAL STAND STRUCTURES and OLD-GROWTH FORESTS and BOREAL FORESTS and FIRE HISTORY and DEAD WOOD and SUCCESSIONAL TRENDS and BARK BEETLE and DYNAMICS and BIODIVERSITY and Sweden and Trees","10.1139/cjfr-2014-0470     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2014-0470",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

The ecosystem model EFIMOD was used to assess the effect of selection cuttings on ecosystem production, carbon sequestration and volume increment in spruce stands. The model was calibrated and validated against experimental data from 20 permanent forest plots in southern Finland where stand responses to uneven-aged management had been monitored for 25 years. The simulated scenarios started with planting trees on bare land, simulation of first decades according to even-aged management, and a subsequent transformation into uneven-aged stand structure and management. Simulated selection cutting scenarios contained variations of both harvest interval (10-30 years) and postharvest stand density (basal area 8-16 m(2) ha(-1)). We hypothesized that longer harvest intervals and higher post-harvest basal areas will positively affect the net ecosystem production, nitrogen use efficiency, and forest carbon sequestration. The results presented here are for a period of 90 years. Simulations showed that net ecosystem production (NEP) increased from 0.25 to 0.5 kg m(-2) a(-1) of carbon with longer harvest intervals and higher postharvest density, and was generally less than that at undisturbed development. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) varied from 100 kg NPP per kg consumed N for heavy cuttings to 300 kg NPP per kg consumed N for light removal of trees. Changes in soil carbon stocks were negative for most scenarios (5-20% decline in terms of total soil C), and the decline was most pronounced with lowest postharvest density and short harvest intervals. The volume of harvested timber was between 320 and 400 m(3) ha(-1) for a 60-year period. Longer harvest intervals resulted in increased timber production. Stem volume growth (5-7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) was equally affected by both harvesting parameters. The cumulative volume of deadwood of 80-120 m(3) ha(-1) was substantially higher with the longest harvest interval (30 years) than with the shorter alternatives where it comprised 40-60 m(3) ha(-1). The simulations provide novel results on different harvesting options for uneven-aged forest management of boreal Norway spruce stands. These results fill a gap in knowledge on ecosystem responses to alternative management regimes and support the development of sustainable management practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"276","rayyan-674259830","Long-term effects of tree harvesting on ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in boreal Scots pine forests","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Management of boreal forests with clear-cutting has a marked effect on forest biodiversity. One directly and severely affected group of species is ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), because of their dependence on living host trees. Key questions in nature conservation and potentially for fungal ecosystem services are whether EMF communities as regenerated stands age will develop into a similar composition as in natural stands, and whether forest regeneration method matters. We addressed these questions by analyzing EMF communities in (1) 157-174 year-old natural and about 50-year-old Scots pine forest stands regenerated by (2) clear-cutting and planting, or (3) shelterwood regeneration with naturally established seedlings. We identified 98 EMF species hypotheses (SHs) using IonTorrent sequencing of soil cores from nine forest stands. We compared these results with a sporocarp survey and an RFLP-analysis of ectomycorrhizal roots performed 18 years earlier. When testing individual SHs (in the sequencing data 2013) 13 of the 20 most frequent EMF SHs in natural forest stands were present in similar frequencies in 50-year-old managed stands whereas 7 SHs were observed at different frequencies. The overall EMF community composition differed between natural and 50-year-old managed stands both when assessing sporocarp data from 1995 to 1998 and sequencing data from 2013. One individually tested SH was found to differ between 50-year-old shelterwood and clear-cut stands and no difference in EMF overall community composition was found between the two regeneration methods. Species richness was similar in all stands. The RFLP-analysis largely identified the same common species as the current study. Our result suggests that timber harvest has a minor effect on frequent EMF in a 30-50 year perspective. However, both the current study of soil mycelia and the sporocarp survey imply the overall composition of EMF communities to be affected. A contributing factor is the higher presence of Norway spruce in the natural stands. Moreover, the majority of species were not sufficiently frequent to be statistically tested. The importance of surviving mycelia, spore bank and new spore deposition is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This biomass removal has raised concern over forest biodiversity. Here, the effects of stump harvesting on spiders, ants, harvestmen, ground beetles and epiedaphic springtails occupying boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest floor were studied two and five years after harvesting by comparing pitfall trap samples from clear-cut sites with and without subsequent stump harvesting and from unharvested mature forests in central Finland. At harvested sites, traps were placed both on intact and exposed mineral soil surface. Open-habitat and generalist ground beetles benefitted from the stump harvesting, but generally the numbers of arthropods between stump harvesting treatments and different aged clear-cuts were rather similar. The intact forest floor hosted more ants, springtails and harvestmen than did the exposed mineral soil. Moreover, the community structure of spiders, ground beetles and spring tails was affected by stump harvesting, forest-floor quality (intact or exposed), and time elapsed since harvesting. Based on these results we recommend minimizing the exposure of mineral soil during management practices.

Hence, mechanical bark treatments, such as debarking, of disturbance-affected trees have been widely promoted as an on-site method of pest control that accounts for conservation targets because woody biomass is retained. However, the effects of debarking to non-target biodiversity remain unclear. We analyzed data from a two-and-a-half-year field survey of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and parasitoid wasps in twelve artificial windthrows, created by pulling down mature Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) with winches. Each experimental windthrow comprising one control tree, one completely debarked tree and one bark-scratched tree. Insects were sampled using stem emergence traps. Fruiting bodies of wood-inhabiting fungi, number of wood wasp emergence holes, and number of holes made by foraging woodpeckers were assessed by visual counts. We recorded the amount of time needed to complete debarking by machine, bark-scratching by machine and bark-scratching by chainsaw each on 15 separate trees to estimate the economic costs of mechanical bark treatments. Our results revealed that both debarking and bark-scratching significantly decreased numbers of the emerging target pest Ips typographus to in median 4% (debarked) and 11% (scratched bark) of the number of individuals emerging from untreated control trees. Compared to control trees, debarking significantly reduced the species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles, and parasitoid wasps. By contrast, bark-scratching did not reduce the overall species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles or parasitoid wasps. The time needed for bark-scratching by machine was significantly lower than debarking, whereas bark-scratching by chainsaw needed a similar amount of time as conventional debarking. However, bark-scratching did have some negative effects in common with debarking, such as the significant reduction of wood wasps emergence holes and the reduction of holes made by foraging woodpeckers. Hence, bark-scratching of downed trees, like debarking, might affect higher trophic levels of biodiversity and should be applied only if pest management is urgently needed. We urge policy makers and natural resource managers to rapidly shift current pest management toward new techniques of bark scratching, particularly in protected areas. Such a shift in post-disturbance pest-control will foster ecosystem integrity at lower economic cost compared to debarking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we study how biotic interactions manifest across a landscape. Location High-latitude northern Finland and Norway ( 69 degrees N, 21 degrees E). Methods We modelled the influence of a dominant shrub, Empetrum hermaphroditum, on spatial patterns of species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens ( using cover of the shrub as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of interaction with other species) across a topographically variable landscape. Results The relationship between the cover of the dominant shrub and species richness differed between guilds, being strongest for vascular plant richness, and varied considerably along environmental gradients. The dominant shrub showed stronger negative impact on vascular plant richness under less abiotically extreme conditions. For lichens, the relationship was the opposite: under mild conditions, species richness increased with the cover of the shrub. Incorporating specific leaf area ( SLA) data into analyses revealed that the dominant shrub affected species with high SLA ( typically competitive species of resource-rich environments) most negatively. Main conclusions Our findings show how the impact of a dominant species varies across a landscape, with distinctly different effects on competitive and stress-tolerant vascular plants, and on bryophytes and lichens.

It includes a size-structured growth model, variable and fixed harvesting costs, and allows for the completely flexible optimization of harvest timing in both regimes. Flexible harvest timing becomes essential when optimizing the transition from clear-cut regimes toward continuous cover forestry. The model is applied to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Low or moderate site productivity, an interest rate above 2%, and a high artificial regeneration cost support the optimality of continuous cover forestry. In its most general form, the optimal clear-cut regime does not exist when the continuous cover regime is globally optimal, and when it exists, the rotation period lengthens with interest rate. The optimal choice between forest management regimes may depend on the initial stand state and whether the naturally regenerated seedlings are utilized in solutions with clearcuts.

Restoration practices now are confronted by climate change, which has the potential to influence long-term restoration outcomes. Concepts and attributes from the resilience literature can help improve restoration and monitoring efforts under changing climate conditions. We systematically examined the published literature on ecological resilience to identify biological, chemical, and physical attributes that confer resilience to climate change. We identified 45 attributes explicitly related to climate change and classified them as individual-(9), population-(6), community-(7), ecosystem-(7), or process-level attributes (16). Individual studies defined resilience as resistance to change or recovery from disturbance, and only a few studies explicitly included both concepts in their definition of resilience. We found that individual and population attributes generally are suited to species-or habitat-specific restoration actions and applicable at the population scale. Community attributes are better suited to habitat-specific restoration at the site scale, or system-wide restoration at the ecosystem scale. Ecosystem and process attributes vary considerably in their type and applicability. We summarize these relationships in a decision support table and provide three example applications to illustrate how these classifications can be used to prioritize climate change resilience attributes for specific restoration actions. We suggest that (1) including resilience as an explicit planning objective could increase the success of restoration projects, (2) considering the ecological context and focal scale of a restoration action is essential in choosing appropriate resilience attributes, and (3) certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems.

In southern Sweden, 90% of productive forest land is used for timber production and stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) constitute approximately 40% of the forested area. Due to their homogeneous structure, these spruce production forests are often regarded as depauperate. Despite this perception, knowledge about the biodiversity found in these stands is scarce. Here we synthesize the results of four separate bird surveys conducted within 35 spruce production stands of southern Sweden. The results are compared to recent population trends within the general study area. In total 49 bird species were recorded, with a strong difference in species composition between newly planted clear-cuts (forest age <15 years) and forests older than 15 years. The majority of species encountered in the older forest category were common forest birds, with a single red-listed species among the regularly occurring species. In contrast, three red-listed ""farmland species"" were frequently encountered in the newly planted forests, revealing the capacity of those birds preferring open and recently disturbed habitats to utilize clear-cuts. A higher diversity of tree sizes and the inclusion of even relatively small proportions (<15%) of broadleaved tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness. Several species encountered in spruce production forests are declining in numbers, but it is not clear whether these stands are acting as source or sink environments for their populations. However, our results indicate that relatively small adjustments to spruce forest management should improve the quality of this widespread habitat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined. Aims. Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective. Methods. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools. Key results. Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7). Conclusions. Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline. Implications. Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.","hunting and human-wildlife interactions and sharp-shooting and vertebrate pest and wildlife management and WHITE-TAILED DEER and EARN-A-BUCK and NEW-ZEALAND and BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION and PEST MAMMALS and WILD BOAR and MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and FOX and PREDATION","10.1071/WR19129     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1071/WR19129",NA,NA,"Global","Multiple but not stated","Summarised evidence"

Management usually simplifies the structure of forests, which results in quantitative and qualitative declines in many microhabitats and species associated with them. In Fennoscandia, most forests are managed for industrial use of wood, but relatively little is known about the relationships between structural components and biodiversity in managed forests. Abundance, composition or species number of different species groups reacting similarly to variation in their environment would be a useful tool e.g. in estimating responses of species that are more difficult to sample. Thus far evidence for, or the lack of, such congruence or indicator functioning is not conclusive. We therefore examined the associations between stand structural features and species diversity and congruence between species groups of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, polypores and beetles. Our study was carried out in mature managed Norway spruce dominated forests in Southern Finland in 2009. Our main findings were (1) cross-taxon congruence in species richness was generally low, suggesting that any single taxonomic group performed poorly as an indicator of overall biodiversity; (2) the volume and diversity of dead trees were the most frequently detected significant predictors of species richness of the studied groups; (3) in terms of species composition, only vascular plants co-varied significantly with bryophytes and lichens; in addition, bryophytes and lichens as well as polypores co-varied significantly with stand structural features; (4) species composition of vascular plants, polypores and saproxylic beetles was associated with the volume of living trees, and in polypores it was also associated with the volumes of both dead and living deciduous trees. These results suggest that biodiversity monitoring for management and conservation requires data from several taxa. However, the volume and diversity of dead wood are useful indicators of stand-level species richness of several taxa, whereas the volume of living trees is an important indicator for the stand-level species composition of several groups. Thus, these structural variables have the potential to function as easily attainable indicators of general forest biodiversity.","Covariation and Indicator and Surrogate and Stand structure and Species richness and Species composition and WOODLAND KEY HABITATS and SPECIES RICHNESS and SOUTHERN FINLAND and BIODIVERSITY INDICATORS and GENERAL COEFFICIENT and SAPROXYLIC BEETLES and INHABITING FUNGI and NORTHERN FOREST and DECAYING WOOD and CO-VARIATION and Fungi","10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.036     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.036",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

However, after clearcut they become sources of carbon for a period of several years. Applying uneven-aged forest management with selective cuttings will maintain tree cover and reduce the environmental impact on forest floor. The aim of this study was to compare the soil CO2 efflux between uneven-aged and even-aged Norway spruce stands with similar site properties, to investigate the effect of management practices on soil CO2 efflux and its possible correlation with soil environmental and chemical properties. We measured soil CO2 efflux in even- and uneven-aged Norway spruce stands (Picea abies [L.] Karst) in southern Finland during the summer of 2013 using closed chamber method on fixed measuring points. The study included two uneven-aged stands and two even-aged stands (a clearcut site and a mature even-aged stand). Soil moisture and soil temperature were measured at the same time as soil CO2 efflux. Soil cores were collected from the topsoil of each study plot to determine soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Mean soil CO2 efflux through the summer was highest in the clearcut plot (0.367 mg m(-2) s(-1)) followed by the uneven-aged stands (0.298 and 0.257 mg m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and the smallest fluxes were measured in the mature even-aged stand (0.224 mg m(-1)s(-1)). There was no statistically significant difference in soil CO2 efflux between the even-and uneven-aged stands of the same site fertility. Even- and uneven-aged stands did not differ significantly in soil moisture or soil temperature. Soil CO2 efflux increased steadily with soil temperature, whereas increasing soil moisture considerably increased soil CO2 efflux at lower moisture levels but only moderately at higher soil moisture levels. Soil carbon and nitrogen concentration did not differ between the study plots of the same fertility. Uneven-aged structure forestry did not prevent the increase in soil CO2 efflux after cuttings. However, the large variation in soil CO2 efflux rates within the uneven-aged stands suggests that the stand level CO2 efflux can be controlled with the intensity of the cutting.","Uneven-aged Forest Structure and Even-aged Forest Structure and Soil CO2 Efflux and FOREST SOIL and PICEA-ABIES and CARBON STORAGE and RESPIRATION and BOREAL and DECOMPOSITION and PRODUCTIVITY and DEPENDENCE and ORDINATION and GROWTH","10.3832/ifor2658-011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor2658-011",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA
"294","rayyan-674261639","Oaks retained in production spruce forests help maintain saproxylic beetle diversity in southern Scandinavian landscapes","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","In Northern Europe, human activities have caused a substantial decrease in the number of old deciduous trees over the last two centuries, leading to a decline in species populations associated with this habitat. One way to mitigate this trend is to increase the abundance of mature and old deciduous trees in commercial forests, such as by tree retention at final harvest. We analysed the biodiversity value of retained mature oaks in the production forests of Norway spruce in southern Sweden, using oaks in pastures as reference. The forest oaks were grown in two different levels of shade. We analysed two categories of saproxylic (i.e. dead wood-dependent) beetles: those utilizing oaks (Group I) and those utilizing oak but not spruce (Group II, which was, therefore, a subcategory of Group I). We found that forest oaks sustained high beetle diversity, in particular, Group I beetles, which were significantly more abundant in forest oaks in heavily thinned patches, as compared with pasture oaks and oaks in moderately thinned patches. For both beetle groups, the composition differed between the forest oaks and pasture oaks, indicating that the forest oaks can be a complementary habitat to that of pasture oaks. There was a positive relationship between oak dead branch diameter and beetle biodiversity, but only for older oaks (similar to 200 years old). We conclude that retaining oaks in production spruce forests can increase the diversity of oak associated beetles at the landscape scale. Since many oak associated species depend on relatively high levels of insolation, management of retained oaks in production forests should include periodic removal of encroaching trees.","Biodiversity conservation and Coleoptera and Quercus robur and Picea abies and Sustainable forestry and Sweden and Tree retention and GREEN-TREE RETENTION and BIRD COMMUNITIES and CONSERVATION and RESPONSES and HARVEST and FRAGMENTATION and RICHNESS and DYNAMICS and RESERVES and HISTORY","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.02.048     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.02.048",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

While we often have detailed information about the foundation species, we know less about its associated species. We explore such a situation, comparing the responses of lichen species associated with different tree taxa, which differ in successional strategy, to the environmental change that takes place when the surrounding trees are clear-cut. Location Boreal forests in Sweden. Methods We illustrated general differences in lichen species composition among four tree taxa and three stand categories using ordination of species occurrences. To analyse responses to clear-cutting we modelled the occurrence probability individually for 144 epiphytic lichen species from the lower 2 m of 2,400 tree trunks of four tree taxa in 130 stands, and compared trees in closed-canopy forests with those retained in logged stands, using Bayesian hierarchical models. Results The composition of lichens on aspen trees deviated clearly from that on the other tree species. Also lichen responses to logging differed among main host tree taxa, where lichen species associated with birches, European aspen, and Scots pine increased in probability of occurrence on trees in logged areas compared to intact forest, while lichen species associated with Norway spruce decreased. We found that time lags for changes in occupancy existed primarily in the increase, but not in the decline, of the groups of lichens associated with different tree taxa. Conclusions Lichens associated with different tree taxa vary in their response to the environmental change brought about by logging, but in a way that differs from the differences in species composition among host trees. Our results highlight the importance of considering the taxa of trees in forest management for the conservation of their associated lichen species. The extent to which the ecology of foundation species influences their associated species merits further inquiry, since such knowledge may facilitate predictions of responses of associated species also in other species-rich communities.","Bayesian hierarchical models and disturbance and environmental change and environmental history and foundation species and host tree species and lichen and response distribution and tree retention and DIVERSITY and EXTINCTION and DYNAMICS and MANAGEMENT and FORESTS and TRAITS and TIME and MACROLICHENS and BIODIVERSITY and COMMUNITY and Trees","10.1111/jvs.12684     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12684",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

We systematically reviewed 126 relevant papers that study the impact of outdoor recreation on wildlife, focusing on terrestrial wildlife (birds excluded) to assess the different methodological approaches adopted by researchers. We characterised the research methods into seven categories (direct observation, indirect observation (field-based), telemetry, camera traps, physiological measurement, trapping, and simulation). We find that direct observation is the most commonly used method to capture human-wildlife interactions, followed by the use of telemetry, and camera traps. The animals most commonly studied were ungulates, and the orders Carnivora and Rodentia. Studies typically captured data over longer periods (median 54 months) when using trapping methods; other methods exhibited shorter study durations (median 22 months). The size of the animal under study appears to influence how methods are chosen, with larger species often being studied using telemetry methods. We highlight advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on the aims of the study, the focal species, and the type of outdoor recreation. Our review highlights the need for simultaneous measurements of both human activity and wildlife response. We also recommend that researchers consider how to capture both short- and long-term impacts on animal welfare.

Generally, wood production conflicts with the provisioning of public-good ES such as the storage of carbon, nutrient retention and conservation of biodiversity. Recognizing that forests generate both private- and public-good ES implies that forestry should be optimized to maximize the contribution of forests to societal welfare. Here we develop an integrated approach for evaluating the contribution of forest ES to welfare. Our approach links the results from dynamic ecosystem modelling to economic valuation and benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the impacts of alternative forestry practices on welfare. We apply the approach to a Norway spruce forest in southern Sweden. We show that current practices are not maximizing societal welfare, because of conflicts in the optimal choice of practices from society's and forest owners' perspectives, and the distribution of welfare between generations. In particular, intensifying biomass production is shown to reduce welfare due to the concomitant degradation of public-good ES, while welfare would improve through expansion of continuous cover forestry. We anticipate that this type of approach will aid the sustainable development of forestry, by informing decision makers of the impacts of alternative forestry practices on societal welfare.","Policy and Cost-benefit analysis and Dynamic modelling and Carbon and Water quality and Biodiversity and BIODIVERSITY and BOREAL and COST and INDICATORS and MITIGATION and TEMPERATE and BENEFITS and INSIGHTS and PRICES and FUTURE and Models, Economic","10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.101011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.101011",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA
"298","rayyan-674258316","Concealed by darkness: How stand density can override the biodiversity benefits of mixed forests","ECOSPHERE","Higher tree species richness often increases the diversity of other taxonomic groups and is promoted in many managed forest systems. The reason for the higher diversity is due to, for example, inter-specific differences in resource filtering of the trees. Resource filtering also depends on the total density of the tree layer, but the interaction between tree species composition and density is, so far, unexplored. Likewise, few studies have addressed whether mixtures of tree species host higher diversity, or support higher productivity, of other taxa than monocultures of the same tree species. We use a gradient in overstory tree species composition, ranging from pure Norway spruce (Picea abies) to pure Birch (Betula sp.), combined with a gradient from open to closed forest, to assess the joint effects of tree species mixture and forest density on the understory vegetation. The cover and species richness of understory vascular plants increased with an increasing proportion of birch and decreased with increasing forest density, while the cover of bryophytes decreased with an increasing proportion of birch and increasing forest density. There were clear interactions between tree species composition and forest density; the decrease in vascular plants with forest density was stronger in forest dominated by spruce than in forests dominated by birch, and the positive effect of an increasing proportion of birch was smaller in dense than in open forests. There were no indications of mixed forests supporting a higher species richness or plant cover than any of the two monocultures. Additionally, few species (10%) showed tendencies toward a higher probability of occurrence in mixed forests, and most of these also occurred in open pure stands. Our results indicate a potential conflict between goals for diversified forests and increased biomass production, as the positive effects for understory vegetation from mixtures may be lost to concomitant increases in forest density. Furthermore, the limited number of species benefiting from mixtures per se indicates that similar biodiversity benefits for understory vegetation may be obtained at landscape levels from the increased use of broadleaf and lower-density production stands, as from mixtures.","diversity interactions and forbs and forest floor vegetation and grasses and ground vegetation and mosses and overstory-understory interactions and UNDERSTORY VEGETATION and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and CANOPY COVER and TEMPERATE and ABUNDANCE and PRODUCTIVITY and DYNAMICS and BIOMASS and MODELS and SPRUCE and Trees","10.1002/ecs2.2835     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2835",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

In southern Sweden, concerns are being raised because production stands of a foundation tree species, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), are being converted to Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Such conversions may lead to biodiversity loss, though the specific nature and extent of such losses remain unknown. Here, we assess the potential biodiversity impacts by contrasting the bird communities of 55- and 80-year-old Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. We also determine the extent to which these production stands capture the available species pool by surveying conifer-dominated reserves. Our results indicate that Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests support overlapping but nevertheless distinct bird communities, though only few recordings were made of the species unique to either stand type. Among the production stands, the 80-year spruce stands had the highest average bird species richness, and largest total number of species recorded. We suggest that the higher diversity can be explained by a higher proportion of broadleaves and higher volumes of dead wood. Although the bird diversity found in the reserves was lower than expected, they benefit gamma diversity at landscape scales as they collectively supported a higher diversity of bird species than the production forests. In summary, the conversion of Scots pine to Norway spruce is likely to increase the homogeneity of the bird communities in this region.","Biodiversity and Forest management and Forest reserves and Forest structure and Plantation forests and PRODUCTION FORESTS and UNDERSTORY VEGETATION and ROTATION LENGTHS and AVIAN DIVERSITY and PICEA-ABIES and BOREAL and PLANTATIONS and COMMUNITIES and SYLVESTRIS and TEMPERATE and Sweden and Norway and Foundations","10.1007/s10113-019-01480-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01480-0",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Here we evaluate the potential ecological consequences of these conversions by surveying the understory vascular plants, stand structural characteristics, and associated understory light levels in three age categories of Scots pine and Norway spruce stands. We quantify the extent of difference in light transmittance between the two stand types, and find large differences in understory abundance, especially among the dwarf shrubs species. Whereas bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) generally dominated Scots pine stand understory, the understory of Norway spruce stands was comparably sparse. Differences in vascular plant community composition indicate associated differences between the two stand types in the conditions prior to stand establishment, and subsequent understory development. In Scots pine stands the high abundance of dwarf shrubs may be outcompeting other species of vascular plants, causing a decline in species richness. In Norway spruce stands, species richness and abundance was instead apparently inhibited by limited light transmittance. In these stands generalist ruderal species and remnants from previous land use constituted a considerable part of plant species composition. Our findings suggest that the regional replacement of Scots pine with Norway spruce will lead to a noticeable loss of understory diversity, for which the decline in Vaccinium species will be the most prominent. We discuss the associated implications of our results for forest ecosystem services, and how shortened rotation lengths in Norway spruce stands would compound these impacts.","Biodiversity and Plant communities and Vaccinium and Light transmittance and Production forest and Conifer and Browsing damage and Ecosystem service and LAND-USE and PRODUCTION FORESTS and ABUNDANCE and PRODUCTIVITY and BIODIVERSITY and DIVERSITY and MOOSE and FLORA","10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.011",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of polypore fungi (species richness and composition) on four different cutting methods (selection, gap, patch, and clear-cutting) plus uncut controls, and the creation of high stumps and cut logs in combination with harvesting. Polypores were inventoried one year before, and two and seven years after cutting. A total of 71 polypore species were found, but no red-listed species were recorded seven years after cutting. Irrespective of the treatment, the variation in polypore richness was best explained by the number of deadwood objects in the stands. Species richness per deadwood object was the highest on natural logs. Species richness per volume of spruce deadwood was the highest on small-diameter deadwood and stumps, intermediate on natural logs and lower on cut logs and high stumps. These results indicate that cut logs created in harvesting cannot compensate the loss of deadwood in cutting and energy wood harvesting. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in rapidly creating habitats for red-listed polypores in commercially managed forests.","Forest management and natural disturbance emulation and silviculture and wood-inhabiting fungi and coarse woody debris and fine woody debris and WOOD-DECAYING FUNGI and RETENTION FORESTRY and DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and MANAGEMENT and DYNAMICS and DEBRIS and ASSOCIATIONS and HABITATS and ECOLOGY and Norway and Trees and Fungi","10.1080/02827581.2019.1663915","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2019.1663915",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

NFM is a nature-based approach that has since gained substantial interest from both practitioners and academics. The review further highlighted the need for catchment-based flood management (CBFM) to enhance resilience to flooding and climate change by incorporating NFM and wider nature-based solutions into hard flood protection systems. Such integrated approaches are considered to be more sustainable and adaptable than the traditional hard-engineered measures. More recently, the European Commission's European Green Deal also highlighted the need for greater use of nature-based solutions including NFM for managing flood risk. Whilst there have been many attempts to quantify the effects of NFM through hydraulic and hydrological modelling, there is still no systematic review conducted for these modelling works. This review aims to summarise the current NFM modelling approaches, as well as discussing their key limitations related to data, model methods, and real-world applications. This paper then goes further to highlight potential solutions to some of these challenges and provides guidance to assist modellers to improve future modelling and data collection process. © 2023 The Authors.

H. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), affect nitrogen (N) losses in forest soil after final felling. A Norway spruce dominated stand was clear-cut and followed by two experimental setups to study the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and leaching of carbon (C) and N. Experiments consisted of four treatments: tree species treatments consisting of 40 kg m−2 of LR and a control treatment without residues. The C losses were monitored as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the N losses as ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) fluxes and concentrations in soil percolation waters and the N2O emissions as fluxes from the forest soil to the atmosphere. In addition the soil temperatures, the molecular size distribution of the DOC from the soil percolation waters and the origin of the N2O production were determined. The LR piles lowered the soil temperatures and, especially those of birch, increased the concentrations of NO3-N in the soil percolation waters already 1 year after the establishment of the piles. The LR piles increased the NH4-N concentrations. The smallest molecular size fraction (<1 kD) of DOC predominated in all treatments. The N2O fluxes peaked under the piles during the second and third growing seasons; however, the inconsistent fluxes tended to be low. The production of N2O was driven by both nitrification and denitrification processes, the proportion depending on the tree species. Our results indicate that LR piles accelerate N losses 1 year after the clear-cutting, especially NO3-N, which predominates in the soil percolation waters under the birch residues, whereas spruce residues tend to stimulate N2O emissions longer. These results have implications for sustainable forest management practices and nutrition of regrowing vegetation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Logging residue piles and N losses and N<sub>2</sub>O and Nitrogen and Soil percolation water and Tree species and Betula and Finland and Nitrous Oxide and Norway and Picea and Pinus sylvestris and Soil and Betula pendula and Picea abies and Forestry and Nitrogen oxides and Organic carbon and Piles and Plants (botany) and Silver and Soil moisture and Solvents and Temperature and ammonia and carbon and nitrate and nitrogen and nitrous oxide and organic nitrogen and water and Betula pendula roth and Dissolved organic carbon and Dissolved organic nitrogen and Molecular size distribution and Molecular size fraction and Nitrification and denitrification and Nitrous oxide emissions and Sustainable forest management and clearcutting and evergreen tree and forest management and forest soil and logging (timber) and percolation and pine and soil nitrogen and Article and concentration (parameter) and controlled study and denitrification and leaching and logging and logging residue and molecular size and molecular size distribution and nitrification and nitrous oxide emission and nonhuman and Norway spruce and pH and priority journal and Scots pine and soil temperature and birch and soil and spruce and Soil pollution","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139743","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139743",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

In addition to reduce using fossil fuels, climatic benefits may be reached by increasing forested areas where appropriate. At present, there is limited data concerning whether differences in C sequestration rates occur among tree species. In this study we evaluated the effects of various species on C sequestration at an early stage of afforestation. Total C stocks, i.e. C in biomass, litter and soil, were compiled for hybrid aspen, poplar, silver birch, Norway spruce, larch and willow. The species were planted in random blocks on five sites at different latitudes. Soil, litter and plant biomass were sampled repeatedly, except for root biomass which was calculated from functions found in the literature. There were no differences between species in total C stocks after 8–9 years growth, except for short rotation coppice (SRC) willows that reached a high production early due to a higher stand density compared to the species managed with short rotation forestry (SRF). Total C sequestration rates for sites varied from zero to 2.3–4.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1. There were no effects of species on soil organic carbon (SOC), but significant decreases were noted for sites with high initial amounts, while SOC was unchanged or increased on sites with lower initial amounts. Mean SOC sequestration rates for sites ranged between −3.0 to 0.78 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Thus, former land use and time since abandonment rather than species seemed to influence the SOC pools at this early stage of afforestation. There were few differences between species in litter C in these young stands. We conclude that increased tree productivity had a positive effect on total C sequestration. It is crucial to include C in both biomass and soil when discussing C capture at land use change. The time factor is important and experiments like this should be followed for an extended time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Afforestation and Litter and SOC and Sweden and Tree biomass and Biomass and Chelation and Fossil Fuels and Land Use and Magnesium and Reforestation and Sites and Soil and Larix and Picea abies and Salix and Agricultural robots and Fossil fuels and Land use and Organic carbon and Soils and Timber and Agricultural land and Biomass and soils and Carbon sequestration and Short rotation coppice and Short-rotation forestries and Soil organic carbon and Stand densities and Whether differences and agricultural land and carbon balance and carbon sequestration and coppice and fossil fuel and land use change and organic carbon and soil organic matter and C (programming language) and Trees","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118129","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118129",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Species selection for, and maintenance of naturalistic plantings are key to their success. While herbaceous and grassy meadows can be mowed, naturalistic plantings with woody plants require more intense maintenance to remove biomass and promote resprouting. We aim to understand woody plant responses to diverse disturbance regimes to potentially inform the selection and management of woody species in urban plantings. We conducted a quantitative systematic literature review of 72 papers and investigated what main external (climate, disturbance regime) and internal (buds, life stage, storage reserves) factors influence the resprouting response of woody plants. We found resprouting literature is geographically widespread for woody plants, but studies are skewed towards Temperate climates in USA and Australia, with a focus on high severity and high frequency fire disturbance. Resprouting response was mostly defined as a continuous response to disturbance dependent on disturbance regime, climate and plant traits. Maintenance and management of naturalistic woody plantings, through hard pruning techniques such as coppicing, may be informed by analogous high severity and high frequency disturbance studies. However, the literature on woody plant resprouting has several knowledge gaps for lower severity and lower frequency disturbance regimes and in more arid climates. Future research should evaluate the response of naturalistic woody plantings to disturbance in specific urban contexts. © 2024 The Authors.

We assessed patterns of spatial forest structure by using individual tree indices based on the nearest-neighbourhood approach. Five different indices were quantified - species mingling, deadwood mingling, deadwood distribution, diameter differentiation and the uniform angle indices characterising the patterns that show the complexity and diversity of forests: the arrangement of tree dimensions, species and deadwood as well as tree positioning regularities. Managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands are remarkably more homogeneous in terms of occurrence and positioning of different tree species and dimensions when compared to unmanaged forests. Managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands rarely show co-occurrence of living and dead trees and demonstrate lower dimensional variability than unmanaged stands. Trees are often quite randomly positioned; slightly regular positionings became evident in managed Norway spruce stands. Structural analysis confirm that large trees are particularly important in maintaining the structural diversity of forests. Forest management needs to integrate maintenance of important structural components and patterns into timber production for biodiversity conservation and sustainable forestry.

Dynamic vegetation models offer an approach to projecting the development of forest carbon sink capacity in a future climate. Forest management capabilities are important to include in dynamic vegetation models to account for the effects of age and species structure and wood harvest on carbon stocks and carbon storage potential. This article describes the implementation of a forest management module containing even-age and clear-cut and uneven-age and continuous-cover management alternatives in the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Different age and species structure initialisation strategies and harvest alternatives are introduced. The model is applied at stand and European scales. Different management alternatives are applied in simulations of European beech (Fagus sylvaticus) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) even-aged monoculture stands in central Europe and evaluated against above-ground standing stem volume and harvested volume data from long-term experimental plots. At the European scale, an automated thinning and clear-cut strategy is applied. Modelled carbon stocks and fluxes are evaluated against reported data at the continent and country levels. Including wood harvest in regrowth forests increases the simulated total European carbon sink by 32g% in 1991-2015 and improves the fit to the reported European carbon sink, growing stock, and net annual increment (NAI). Growing stock (156gm3gha-1) and NAI (5.4gm3gha1gyr1) densities in 2010 are close to reported values, while the carbon sink density in 2000-2007 (0.085gkggCgm-2gyr1) equates to 63g% of reported values, most likely reflecting uncertainties in carbon fluxes from soil given the unaccounted for forest land-use history in the simulations. The fit of modelled and reported values for individual European countries varies, but NAI is generally closer to reported values when including wood harvest in simulations. © Copyright:","Europe and Fagus sylvatica and Matthiola and Picea abies and carbon balance and carbon dioxide and carbon emission and coniferous tree and deciduous tree and estimation method and forest management and harvesting and monoculture and stand structure and vegetation dynamics","10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021","https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

They provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient recycling and water regulation. Here, we contrast the species richness, cover and community composition of forest floor bryophytes and lichens in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated production forests. The study sites were located in the hemiboreal zone of southern Sweden, and represented early-, mid- and late rotation stands. Our aim was to examine the potential consequences for forest floor biodiversity from the decreasing use of Scots pine production forests in this region. Whereas Scots pine and Norway spruce stands did not differ in bryophyte cover, we found a higher cover of lichens in Scots pine stands, and highest in the intermediate aged stands. Also the species richness of lichens was higher in the Scots pine stands, while bryophyte species richness was higher in the Norway spruce stands. Differences in canopy cover and associated light transmittance to the forest floor appears to be important drivers for distinctive different forest floor communities in the Scots pine and Norway spruce stands, as revealed by Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Mean Ellenberg indicator values for bryophytes and lichens showed that species associated with Scots pine stands were characterized by their tolerance of brighter conditions, higher insolation, and better adaptation to a continental climate. Norway spruce stands instead had a comparably larger proportion of species tolerating lower light, but also indicators of higher available nutrient levels, humidity, and pH. The outcome of the Ellenberg indicator species analysis, as well as the larger cover of lichens,and adaptations to drought found among some mosses, revealed that forest floor communities are shaped by different environmental factors in Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. These environmental differences, and the quantified shifts in forest floor communities identified in this study, indicate the large shifts in understory bryophyte and lichen species composition and abundance that is likely to occur if Scots pine stands are converted to Norway spruce. © 2021 The Authors","Biodiversity and Ellenberg indicator values and Liverwort and Managed coniferous plantations and Moss and Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris and Understory vegetation and Ecosystems and Floors and Forestry and Fungi and Nutrients and Plants and Sweden and Bryophyta and bryophytes and Indicator indicator and Vegetation and Ellenberg indicator value and Forest floors and Managed coniferous plantation and Norway spruce and Scots pine and bryophyte and community composition and coniferous forest and ecosystem service and forest floor and lichen and nutrient availability and species diversity and species richness and stand structure and understory and Norway","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119210","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119210",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

The implications for biodiversity are often measured by contrasting broadleaf-conifer mixtures with conifer-dominated stands. However, few studies include broadleaf-dominated stands in these assessments. Here we contrasted the bird assemblages of even-aged production forests along a mixture gradient from Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated, to birch (Betula spp.) dominated stands in southern Sweden. We conducted point count surveys of bird individuals exhibiting breeding behaviour within 30 stands varying from <0.5% to over 98.5% broadleaf by basal area. A total of 355 birds were detected, comprising 36 bird species, seven of which are classified as near threatened by the Swedish Red-list. Our results indicate i) a distinct shift in bird community composition linked to the percentage of broadleaf trees at stand and landscape scales, ii) significantly higher bird species richness, evenness, and abundance in stands with a higher proportion of birch, iii) higher bird abundance in birch-dominated stands than in mixtures, and iv) shifts in bird species guilds as related to stand basal area, the amount of shrubs in the understory, and quantities of dead wood. All of these results have implications for the ways in which production forest management could be altered to enhance avian diversity, and we discuss these with respect to the use of broadleaf versus mixed-species stands. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bird conservation and Broadleaved forest and Forest biodiversity and Managed forest and Mixed species stands and Betula and Biodiversity and Birds and Conservation and Forestry and Mixtures and Production and Trees and Sweden and Coniferophyta and Picea abies and Plants (botany) and Bird species and Broad-leaved forests and Broadleaf forest and Broadleaf trees and Habitat availability and Mixed forests and Mixed-species stands and abundance and biodiversity and broad-leaved forest and community response and coniferous tree and forest management and habitat availability and reproductive behavior","10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119299","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119299",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Evaluation of the net effects of different policy instruments on real-world outcomes is crucial. First, we present data on final felling rates in wood production landscapes and stand age distribution dynamic in two case study regions, and changes in dead wood amounts in Sweden. Second, the growth of formally protected areas was compiled and changes in functional connectivity analysed in these regions, and the development of dead wood and green tree retention in Sweden was described. The case studies were the counties Dalarna and Jämtland (77,000 km2 ) representing an expanding frontier of boreal forest transformation. In the wood production landscape, official final felling rates averaged 0.84%/year, extending the regional timber frontier. The amount of forest <60 years old increased from 27–34% in 1955 to 60–65% in 2017. The amounts of dead wood, a key forest naturalness indicator, declined from 1994 to 2016 in north Sweden, and increased in the south, albeit both at levels far below evidence-based biodiversity targets. Formal forest protection grew rapidly in the two counties from 1968 to 2020 but reached only 4% of productive forests. From 2000 to 2019, habitat network functionality for old Scots pine declined by 15–41%, and Norway spruce by 15–88%. There were mixed trends for dead wood and tree retention at the stand scale. The net result of the continued transformation of near-natural forest remnants and conservation efforts was negative at the regional and landscape levels, but partly positive at the stand scale. However, at all three scales, habitat amounts were far below critical thresholds for the maintenance of viable populations of species, let alone ecological integrity.

Continuous-cover forestry can maintain similar invertebrate and plant communities to unmanaged forest, but whether this extends to soil fungal communities remains unclear. Within four sites across the mid-boreal zone of Sweden, we conducted a comprehensive study to assess the impact of continuous-cover and clear-felling on soil fungi and chemical properties within Norway spruce dominated forests, using unmanaged forest as a control. We sampled soils for chemical properties (pH, carbon, nitrogen, C/N and Organic matter) and used both surveys of fungal fruiting bodies and state of the DNA metabarcoding techniques to assess treatment effects on soil fungal communities. We found that forest management practices had significant effects soil pH, C and C/N ratio and that continuous-cover forestry had more similar soil properties to unmanaged forest. Furthermore, the biodiversity of fruiting bodies, as expressed by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, was higher in continuous-cover forestry and unmanaged forest compared to clear-felled areas. However, the opposite was true for the diversity of soil fungal communities, which was probably due to the high level of disturbance in clear-felled areas, and thus, ample habitat for early successional colonisers and some remnants of mature forest communities. However, in agreement with predictions we found that the composition of both fruiting body and soil fungal communities broadly similar in continuous-cover and unmanaged forest, but fundamentally different to clear-felled areas. Consequently, our findings highlight that continuous-cover forestry is an alternative to conventional practise, maintaining communities associated with unmanaged forest and mimicking natural disturbance regimes. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity and Even-aged and uneven-aged silvicultural systems and Fruit-bodies and Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Soil chemistry and Soil fungus and Coverings and Ecosystems and Forestry and Forests and Fungi and Picea Abies and Soil and Norway and Sweden and Invertebrata and Picea abies and pH effects and Soils and Timber and Alternative management and Community structures and Continuous cover forestries and Early-successional and Ecosystem functions and Forest management practices and Natural disturbance regime and Soil fungal communities and boreal forest and community structure and coniferous forest and coniferous tree and disturbance and ecosystem function and forest cover and forest management and fungus and plant community and soil property and soil-vegetation interaction and species diversity and species richness and Trees","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118659","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118659",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

While biodiversity on clear-cuts has been much studied, other common forestry stages such as thinning have received less attention. We studied saproxylic beetles, a highly diverse group with many red-listed species, in young spruce stands 2–5 years after pre-commercial thinning. This intervention often creates sun-exposed dead wood, also of deciduous trees such as birch, potentially favoring many of these beetle species. To help evaluate this forestry stage, we compared the saproxylic beetle fauna of 10 thinned spruce stands with that of 10 geographically matched semi-natural woodland key habitats (WKHs) in Sweden. Local and overall species numbers of saproxylic beetles were similar in the two forest types, but they differed in species composition. Compared with WKHs, thinned stands had an overall lower number of species on deciduous wood, fungivorous species, and red-listed or previously red-listed species. Between-stand diversity was also lower for thinned than for WKH stands. Thus, while pre-commercially thinned spruce forests hosted many saproxylic beetle species, including some red-listed ones, WKHs provide habitat for a more variable fauna, especially for beetle groups of conservation concern. Woodland key habitats, although small, are a valuable complement to young production forests of spruce for the conservation of saproxylic beetle species. © 2020 The Authors","Betula and Canopy openness and Coleoptera and Conservation and Cutting and Dead wood and Fine woody debris and Forest management and Harvest and Insect biodiversity and Logging residue and Picea and Woodland key habitats and Animals and Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Forestry and Insects and Picea Abies and Sweden and Hexapoda and Picea abies and Ternary alloys and Timber and Conservation values and Management and conservations and Norway spruce stands and Number of species and Pre-commercial thinning and Saproxylic beetles and Species composition and Stand diversity and beetle and biodiversity and clearcutting and coniferous tree and conservation status and deciduous tree and endangered species and forest management and stand structure and thinning and woodland and Norway and Beetles","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118584","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118584",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

However, current legislation restricts the amount of wood ash that can be applied and it is desirable to increase the allowed application dose, if possible, without negative effects on the plantation ecosystems. Here, we applied wood ash in levels corresponding to 0, 3, 9, 15, 30, and 90 t ash ha−1 and monitored the effect of the different ash doses on bryophytes in a Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantation with a dense bryophyte cover dominated by Hypnum jutlandicum, Dicranum scoparium, and Pleurozium schreberi. We used two complementary methods, image analysis, and pinpoint registration during a three-year period. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply this combined effort, which provides a much more exhaustive description of the effects than the use of each method separately. Moreover, the inclusion of a wide range of different wood ash levels enabled us to establish detailed dose-response relationships, which previous authors have not presented. The bryophyte cover decreased with increasing ash level with concomitant changes in species composition. At ash doses above the currently allowed 3 t ha−1, the ash significantly reduced the bryophyte cover, which only re-established very slowly. With increasing wood ash dose, the dominating species changed to Brachythecium rutabulum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Funaria hygrometrica. We conclude that application of more wood ash in spruce plantations than currently allowed will reduce total cover of bryophytes and cause a pronounced change in bryophyte species composition. These changes will in particular harm bryophyte species with specific environmental requirements and generally impair the bryophyte cover as habitat for invertebrates and its economic value for moss harvesting. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite rapid stand development on productive soils, even-aged silviculture cannot host most old-forest species. However, their habitat quality could be supported in landscape mosaics with retention forestry and set-asides. Context: The most productive forest lands have naturally the richest bird assemblages but tend to be also most intensively managed. Sustainable solutions to this conflict are unclear. Aim: To assess bird assemblages and their successional dynamics in planted Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands compared to naturally developing stands. Methods: We mapped breeding bird assemblages in forty 5-ha plots on highly productive soils in Estonia. The plots included sets of naturally regenerated and planted stands, and (as successional endpoints) clear-cuts and old stands. Results: Planted stands had fewer bird species and pairs than naturally regenerated stands; the latter having a species composition resembling late-successional deciduous-dominated stands. Importantly, the species composition in mature spruce plantations converged toward the composition observed in late-successional conifer-dominated stands. Downed dead wood, stand age, deciduous trees, and stock density were the most significant stand characteristics shaping bird assemblages. Conclusion: The habitat value of established spruce plantations can be primarily improved by allowing for some deciduous trees and gaps with deciduous undergrowth. At the landscape scale, the bird diversity of even-aged systems would be enhanced by multi-scale applications of retention forestry—from retention trees to old-growth set-asides. © 2022, The Author(s).","Biodiversity and Natural regeneration and Old-forest birds and Planted forest and Resident birds and Sustainable forest management and Estonia and Norway and comparative study and deciduous tree and forest management and habitat quality and landscape and landscape ecology and mixed forest and plantation forestry and silviculture and sustainable forestry and Picea","10.1186/s13595-022-01138-8","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13595-022-01138-8",25.9168702506338,58.648108311231,"Estonia",NA,NA

A higher species richness, and more unique species, was found on trees of Scots pine than of Norway spruce, and distinctive communities were associated with the two tree species. Lichen species composition also shifted between the 30-, 55- and 80-year-old stands, although there was no significant difference in species richness between the different age classes. Tree species and age of the stand explained most of the variation in community composition (41%), with additional variance explained by lichen proximity to the ground (6%) and aspect (1%) (northern/southern side of trunk). Scots pine and Norway spruce share many attributes, such as both being conifers with acidic bark properties and having a similar geographical distribution in Fennoscandia. However, our study showed that species richness and community composition can nevertheless diverge in stands dominated by these two tree species. Since the occurrence of red-listed species was low in these stands, we suggest that 80-year rotations are not long enough for the occurrence of the many rare and specialized lichen species that require old forest structures and long forest continuity in this region.

This article reviews published evaluations of restoration efforts on the ground and those identified or proposed in the literature. This review found few reports of the effectiveness of restoration measures, and of those reported there was strong temporal and geographical bias. Reports were mostly recent and took place within mussel-diverse regions of the Global North (i.e. North America, Europe). Efforts focused on population support encompassed relocation, translocation and population augmentation from captive breeding, and potential restoration approaches emphasized planning and prioritization. It was challenging to assess restoration success owing to differences in success metrics and varied lengths of post-restoration monitoring. Some measures were inherently more species specific, such as population support, but some articles suggested that the use of multiple measures may allow more species to be addressed by restoration efforts. Consistent documentation and reporting of restoration measures - including failed ones - are needed to advance freshwater mussel restoration. In addition, continued work is needed to accelerate and better align the development and use of restoration approaches for freshwater mussels. Reporting of unsuccessful or partially successful attempts does not adequately reflect the long life histories of freshwater mussels. Investigation of the contexts where approaches have been effective (even partially), and concerted efforts to implement combinations of measures at a catchment scale are critical for unionids globally. As such, recommendations are posed to aid integration of research and practice to advance and further develop freshwater mussel restoration.","augmentation and conservation and freshwater mussels and relocation and restoration and synthesis and translocation and Unionida and MARGARITIFERA-MARGARITIFERA and UNIONID MUSSELS and ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION and DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA and CONSERVATION and BIODIVERSITY and POPULATION and RELOCATION and BIVALVIA and NORTH","10.1002/aqc.3750","https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3750",NA,NA,"Global","Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management. We expect that this review will provide direction for invasive plant species research and management aimed at protecting biodiversity in European temperate forest ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Langmaier and Lapin.","biological invasion and exotic plants and forest dynamics and ground vegetation and invasive species management and neophytes and rejuvenation and tree seedlings","10.3389/fpls.2020.524969","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.524969",NA,NA,"Europe","Forest","Summarised evidence"

The aim of this study was to find how the macrophyte Juncus bulbosus Linnaeus affects salmonids and benthic macroinvertebrates in Norwegian rivers. The proliferation of J. bulbosus in the study rivers commenced after the development of hydropower in the 1960s and 1970s. J. bulbosus is now considered a nuisance for humans in many areas of the rivers. We found a higher density of juvenile fish and higher density, weight and species richness of invertebrates in areas with J. bulbosus than in areas with gravel, suggesting that the vegetation is not limiting fish and invertebrates. This may be because macrophytes increase the surface area and provide shelter, food and a variety of ecological niches. Adult salmonid fish can be negatively affected when their spawning grounds are covered by vegetation. However, overgrowth is not common and may take years since fish clear the river bed of macrophytes during redd digging, indicating competition between macrophytes and fish for riverbed habitat. Our results suggest that one should not assume that outgrowths of macrophytes have negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is important to map all impacts and distinguish nuisance to humans from effects on the ecosystem. © 2020, The Author(s).","Benthic invertebrates and Ecosystem services and Freshwater management and Hydropower and Juncus bulbosus and Salmonids and Norway and Invertebrata and Salmonidae and freshwater ecosystem and invertebrate and macroinvertebrate and macrophyte and river basin and river bed and salmonid and species richness and submerged vegetation and Vegetables","10.1007/s10750-020-04465-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04465-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Rivers & lakes","Observational studies"

These mosaics of mires and wind exposed patches have ericaceous shrub dominated vegetation, and soils within coastal heathlands are characterized by low pH and high levels of recalcitrant debris. Using a culture-based approach with molecular identification of isolates, we characterized root-associated fungal communities of six ericaceous species in eight heathland localities along Norway’s western coast. Site-level alpha diversity ranged from 21-38 OTUs, while the total estimated gamma diversity for culturable heathland root fungi was 190-231 OTUs. Most species recovered are previously reported at low abundance in Norway, suggesting the biodiversity in this community is underreported, rather than novel for science. The fungi recovered were primarily Ascomycota, specifically endophytic Phialocephala, and Pezicula, and no host specificity was observed in the communities. The fungal communities exhibited high turnover and low nestedness, both between ericaceous hosts and across heathland sites. We observed no spatial patterns in fungal betadiversity, and this heterogeneity may be a product of the unique historic land use practices at each locality creating a distinct mycofloral “fingerprint”. Robust diversity estimates will be key for managing fungal biodiversity in coastal heathlands. Our results indicate that sampling schemes that maximize the number of host plants sampled per site, rather than the number of cultures per plant yield improved alpha diversity estimates. Similarly, gamma diversity estimates are improved by maximizing the total number of localities sampled, rather than increasing the number of plants sampled per locality. We argue that while the current protected status of coastal heathland habitats and restoration efforts have knock-on effects for the conservation of fungal biodiversity, fungi have a vital functional role in the ecosystem and holistic conservation plans that consider fungal biodiversity would be beneficial.

We describe spawning induction and behavior, fertilization success, embryonic and auricularia larval development rate for this species under laboratory conditions. The larvae were fed a mixture of three species of live microalgae (SWE) and algal paste (NO). Larval development rate and survival were monitored at four different temperatures (7, 10, 13, and 16°C). Results showed faster development with increasing temperature. Daily food consumption rate was highest at the highest temperature. The combined effects of temperature and food availability on survival were investigated for the same four temperatures and three different feed concentrations.

The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked}the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon cycle and Climate change and Ecosystem effects and Feedback and Flood events and Norway and carbon cycle and carbon sequestration and climate change and ecosystem service and environmental effect and flood and global climate and landscape ecology and sustainability and Buffers","10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0059.1","https://doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-21-0059.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Opinions"

These effects are challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation affects habitat selection at the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We fitted resource selection functions at the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation. Scale-dependent responses and temporal adjustments in habitat use may facilitate coexistence between humans and large carnivores.","Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.1038/s41598-022-08468-7","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08468-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Using ecosystem services as a conceptual frame, we study a local solution to alleviate goose-human conflicts in an agricultural region in Sweden. Increasing goose numbers and crop damage led to the foundation of a goose management group (GMG), comprising landowners, farmers, hunters, ornithologists, conservation NGOs, and local and county level administration. The GMG was not given any formal or legal authority. We asked: is this management solution successful? Which problems can be solved and which remain? Can the GMG stand as a model for management of other species and in other landscapes? We interviewed present members of the GMG and analyzed minutes from its meetings. We found that the GMG has autonomy to self-organize and shows adaptive capacity over time in handling variability and complexity in its socio-ecological system. This makes the GMG a sustainable solution for local management of a resource in which goose population growth and legislation are decided at other (national or international) levels. We assessed what constitutes perceived success and found that GMG is geared toward mediation of opposing preferences by establishing a figurative handshake between stakeholders. By comparing how four general challenges in ecosystem service management align with formative attributes of the GMG, we discuss in which ways this management solution is applicable to other ecosystem services in other contexts.","collaborative management and ecosystem service and geese and governance and socio-ecological systems and stakeholder and sustainability and KRISTIANSTADS-VATTENRIKE and ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT and COMMONS","10.3390/su71215794     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/su71215794",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes' different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being. The aim of this study is to identify and locate such land cover types as GI that provide multiple ES important for human well-being in rural settings. First, we interviewed 400 urban and rural residents to identify ES important for personal well-being and the land covers that deliver multiple ES in three counties that best represent the existing rural-urban gradient in Sweden. Second, to support the inclusion of GI in spatial planning, we identified and located spatial concentrations of individual land covers providing multiple ES (GI hubs) and significant clusters of such land covers (GI hotspots). The majority of urban and rural respondents associated their well-being with lakes, mountains above the tree line, old-growth forests, wooded-pastures, mature pine forests and rural farmsteads. The areal proportion of each type of hub was low, on average 3.5%. At least three land management strategies are needed to sustain GI hubs: maintenance of the composition, structure and function of natural ecosystems in protected areas; support for traditional agroforestry and villages as social-ecological systems; and diversification of the current intensive forest management approach.","Ecosystem services and Spatial planning and Agroforestry and Protected area and Mature forests and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and LANDSCAPE and OUTCOMES and CONSERVATION and PERSPECTIVES and BIODIVERSITY and PERCEPTIONS and MANAGEMENT and VALUATION and DIVERSITY and Humanities and Humanism and Humans and Sweden","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.09.031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.09.031",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location: Highways in southeast Norway. Methods: We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results: Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions: It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success. © 2022 The Authors.

A conflict over restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised comprehensive local debate.

Due to continuous decline in eider populations in the island of Tautra off the Norwegian west coast from the late 1970s and onwards a number of conservation measures were implemented here to halt this development and the results are yet to be seen. This paper presents the conservation of declining eider populations in Tautra as a case study of conservation challenges in agricultural landscapes, and illustrates the complex interconnections of human use of biological resources and habitat shaping within the context of a subsistence agroecosystem. It contributes new data and perspectives on the challenge to conserve dimensions of biological diversity that have been shaped and developed within previous and lost agroecosystems and economic contexts. The current paper shows the hazard of focussing conservation measures on only one dimension of biodiversity without incorporating other dimensions like the human management of other habitats which had important functions for the development of habitats for the target biodiversity component in the pre-industrial agroecosystem. Successful biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes demands involvement of the historical aspect of resource use to understand the ecological dynamics of habitats and populations. Further, since the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of one habitat are interrelated to other habitats, it is necessary to include the landscape mosaic with different habitats in the conservation efforts and programmes.

Saami herders maintain a legal monopoly as suppliers of reindeer meat, a traditional luxury product in Norway. Design/methodology/approach - This paper shows that a review of the literature is supported by qualitative interviews. Findings - The paper argues that main explanatory variables are to be found in the interaction of a number of factors, mainly: cyclical climatic variation in Northern Norway; a system with fixed prices, independent of the variations in supply, that magnified the effects of the natural cycles; increasingly severe sanitary regulations forcing Saami herders to abandon slaughtering and preparation; and the oligopoly market powers of the non-Saami actors taking over slaughtering and processing. It is argued that the fall in herders' income resulted from a failure of the Norwegian Department of Agriculture to understand key factors distinguishing sub-Arctic herding from sedentary agriculture. Sanitary requirements and the government's quest for economies of scale in processing contributed to playing the volume of production into the hands of non-Saami oligopolies. In this way the Saami herders lost the meat production that traditionally was at the core of both their culture and their economic livelihood. Originality/value - The paper is relevant for the management of herding and other production systems in areas with cyclical production, and documents the damaging effects on the aboriginal culture resulting from Norway's exclusive use of modem agricultural science in managing such systems.","culture (sociology) and government policy and meat and entrepreneurialism and Norway","10.1108/00070700610676352     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1108/00070700610676352",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objectives of such planning include primarily timber production and maintenance of biodiversity, but also aspects such as aesthetics and recreation. The variety of approaches and models that have emerged is caused by regional differences in land-use history, forest conditions, recreation pressure, and ownership. We distinguish three approaches: The species approach and the naturalness approach integrate conservation aspects, while the multiple aspects approach integrates several aspects (biological, social, economic, spiritual, etc.) into commercial timber-producing forestry. The species approach is exemplified by the key habitat - corridor model in which key habitats and corridors are preserved to support certain species. The natural landscape model illustrates an example of the naturalness approach, as it integrates natural forest features from a fire-disturbed landscape and gives examples of management implications at the landscape as well as at the stand level. The multiple aspects approach combines several objectives and defines important structures rather loosely. This approach was developed in areas where private nonindustrial forestry dominates. Nontimber and nonconservation aspects therefore become relevant to forest management. The supportive feature model exemplifies an application of that approach.","BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY and NATURE-RESERVES and CONSERVATION and BIODIVERSITY and ECOLOGY and DESIGN and Sweden","10.1139/cjfr-28-2-159     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-28-2-159",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity management that enhanced a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), current farm management has shifted toward more intensive farm models. This study assesses the supply of ES in four study areas dominated by managed wood-pastures in Spain, Sweden, and Romania. On the basis of 144 farm surveys and the use of multivariate techniques, we characterize farm management and structure in the study areas and identify the trade-offs in ES supply associated with this management. We link these trade-offs to multiple factors that characterize the landholding: economic, social, environmental, technological, and governance. Finally, we analyze how landholders' values and perspectives have an effect on management decisions. Results show a differentiated pattern of ES supply in the four study areas. We identified four types of trade-offs in ES supply that appear depending on what is being promoted by the farm management and that are associated with different dimensions of wood-pasture management: productivity-related trade-offs, crop production-related trade-offs, multifunctionality-related trade-offs, and farm accessibility-related trade-offs. These trade-offs are influenced by complex interactions between the properties of the SES, which have a direct influence on landholders' perspectives and motivations. The findings of this paper advance the understanding of the dynamics between agroecosystems and society and can inform system-based agricultural and conservation policies.","TRADITIONAL RURAL REGION and SCATTERED TREES and LAND-USE and BIODIVERSITY and MANAGEMENT and LANDSCAPE and FARMERS and BUNDLES and SUSTAINABILITY and PARTICIPATION","10.1126/sciadv.aar2176     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aar2176",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

One approach is to make the evaluations quantitatively so that analyses based on trade-offs between decision criteria can be carried out. This requires that the ecological objectives should also be assessed numerically. The present paper studies the numerical assessment of ecological values of forest ecosystem management in the context of multi-criteria planning. In a case study concerning planning applied to a forest area in Kainuu, eastern Finland, the ecological values were described by the amount of old forest, the amount of dead wood and the amount of deciduous trees. Compared to previous models, recently developed statistical modelling techniques were applied to handle the assessment process. The advantages of the statistical approach included that the potential interactions between the ecological variables can be taken into account. The case study results showed statistically significant interactions between the amount of old forest and the amount of dead wood suggesting that the proposed model is of practical importance for multi-criteria forest ecosystem management.

Declines have been attributed to many factors including habitat loss. Habitat is an integral component of any species and should be a central focus of conservation efforts to protect at risk species. However, the habitat of bumble bee species is not fully understood. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature using Web of Science to summarize articles that have described the habitat of bumble bee species. In total, 55 nesting and 10 overwintering habitat studies are described in this review. We described common patterns associated with bumble bee studies including overwintering habitat, landscape type, and ground position. We found that bumble bee nests are more frequently found underground and that studies were biased towards the United Kingdom and agricultural habitats. There are some preferences in nesting and overwintering habitat, but further research is needed to draw any substantial conclusions. Detection of nesting and overwintering site studies may be improved using citizen science initiatives and possibly through employing detection dogs or radio-telemetry. Increasing the detection of nesting and overwintering sites is an important priority to improve our understanding of bumble bee habitat.

How-ever, it has non‐negligible negative impacts on the environment and landscape aesthetics where the energy is produced, affecting the recreational interests of the public using the respective local river spaces. The preferences of the local public are increasingly assessed and involved in the planning of mitigation measures for impacted rivers. Aesthetic assessment methods using a common user per-spective, i.e., an “on‐the‐ground” perspective, could potentially be improved by using an aerial perspective facilitated by modern drone technology. Studies on the compatibility of these two perspectives of assessment in terms of public preference elicitation are lacking so far. In river Nea, Norway, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the visual preferences of the local public for different environmental mitigation measures related to weirs, minimum flow, and recreational infrastructure using both perspectives. The results indicate that there exist significant differences in the preferences for scenarios based on the two different visual perspectives, and that a compatibility between them cannot be assumed and therefore requires further investigation. Finally, based on our study setup and previous experience, we outline and propose a standardized procedure for the visualization of mitigation measures as an input to environmental design projects where public perception is incor-porated. © 2021 by the authors.

However, although urban agriculture is also often cited as promoting biodiversity in urban areas, the extent of empirical evidence for such claims has not been studied. Here we systematically review the relationship between urban agriculture and biodiversity in the scientific literature. We strictly define urban agriculture as areas in cities that grow produce specifically for human consumption. We examined 148 papers from 2000 to 2017, of which only 24 studies fit our definition of urban agriculture, and of those, only 18 both involved urban agriculture and measured biodiversity. Of the studies that did measure biodiversity, some showed increases in diversity compared to urban vacant lots, but other showed no difference. Moreover, these studies were mostly focused on plants and invertebrates and were conducted almost exclusively in North America. In order to use the generalization that urban agriculture will have a positive influence on urban biodiversity, more studies will need to be conducted across a wider geographic range worldwide (particularly in developing countries in the tropics) and on a greater diversity of species and taxa (e.g., herpetiles, birds and small mammals). Such studies will likely increase in conservation importance as urban expansion and agricultural demands increase globally.","Biodiversity and Species richness and Urban green space and Urban agriculture and Urban gardens and Wildlife and SPECIES RICHNESS and EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE and LANDSCAPE DRIVERS and GARDENS and ABUNDANCE and DIVERSITY and FUTURE and CONSERVATION and LAND and CITY","10.1007/s11252-018-0748-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-018-0748-8",NA,NA,"Global","Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Yet freshwater biodiversity is continuing to decline rapidly. To date there has been no formal review of the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving or restoring biodiversity in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. We present the first assessment using a systematic review of the published scientific evidence of the effectiveness of freshwater protected areas. Systematic searches returned 2,586 separate publications, of which 44 provided quantitative evidence comprising 75 case studies. Of these, 38 reported positive, 25 neutral, and 12 negative outcomes for freshwater biodiversity conservation. Analysis revealed variable relationships between conservation effectiveness and factors such as taxa assessed, protected area size and characteristics, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) protected area category, and ecoregion. Lack of effectiveness was attributed to many anthropogenic factors, including fishing (often with a lack of law enforcement), water management (abstraction, dams, and flow regulation), habitat degradation, and invasive non-native species. Drawing on the review and wider literature we distil eight lessons to enhance the effectiveness of protected areas for freshwater biodiversity conservation. We urge policymakers, protected area managers, and those who fund them to invest in well-designed research and monitoring programs and publication of evidence of protected area effectiveness. © 2019 The Authors.

Small rivers in agricultural landscapes are especially exposed to excessive technical actions implemented in order to allow for harvesting river water for irrigation, draining agricultural water and receiving sewage. Regular dredging and macrophyte removal strongly interfere with the global need for preserving river biodiversity that allows agricultural lowland rivers to remain refuges for a variety of species, and-accordingly-to keep water bodies resilient for the benefit of society. In order to provide a comprehensive look at the influence of agricultural lowland river management on the ecological status of these water bodies, we conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis. For the structured literature review we selected 203 papers reflecting on the response of aquatic ecosystems to dredging and macrophyte management actions. The database of scientific contributions developed for our study consists of papers written by the authors from 33 countries (first authorship) addressing dredging, macrophyte removal, status of fish and macroinvertebrates as well as the general ecological status of lowland agricultural rivers. We revealed that 96% of the analyzed papers indicated unilateral, negative responses of aquatic ecosystems, particularly macroinvertebrates, ichthyofauna and macrophyte composition, to maintenance measures. We revealed that studies conducted in the European Union on the ecological status of rivers appeared to significantly increase in quantity after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Finally, we concluded that day-to-day management of lowland agricultural rivers requires revision in terms of compliance with environmental conservation requirements and the recurrent implementation of technical measures for river maintenance.

Following screening, a small number of articles (40) were found relevant, representing studies quantifying non-point source nutrient losses from urban and peri-urban environments. Evidence was split between plot- and catchment-scale. Plot-scale studies often included evaluations of engineered nature-based solutions. At catchment-scale, studies of streamwater quality typically investigated influence of contributory catchment nutrient sources. Wide ranges of beneficial reductions were apparent, and at both scales not all studies identified significant benefits. Summarizing against this backdrop, at plot (micro-) scale woodland reduces mean concentrations in runoff, soil or groundwater by an average of 44.2% for total nitrogen (TN) and 47.0% for total phosphorus (TP). At catchment (meso-) scale, evidence suggests a 20% areal addition of forest at the expense of mixed urban fabric can reduce mean concentrations by 15.7% and 12.6% for TN and TP respectively. Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts. Canopy cover suppresses stream channel biological nitrogen uptake, which based on all evidence appears considerable. However, unshaded headwaters can foster accelerated primary productivity with undesirable downstream consequences. Overall, gathering further evidence is encouraged, given current uncertainties, especially to address differences between impervious, permeable and riparian urban woodland settings.","forest and tree and river and leaf litter and riparian and impervious and water quality and nitrogen and phosphorus and WATER-QUALITY and LEAF-LITTER and LAND-USE and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and NITROGEN and PHOSPHORUS and STREAM and FOREST and EXPORT and IMPACTS","10.1029/2022WR032626     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032626",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Forest","Summarised evidence"

However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human-carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the 'pre-genomic era' and the first insights of the 'genomics era'. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650-850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.","Canis lupus and conservation genomics and European Union policy and gene flow and large carnivores and wolf management and microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA and SNP and Y chromosome and WOLVES CANIS-LUPUS and BEAR URSUS-ARCTOS and SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS and HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX LOCI and COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES and BROWN BEAR and ITALIAN WOLF and GREY WOLVES and HABITAT SUITABILITY and SPATIAL STRUCTURE","10.1111/brv.12298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12298",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conflict between humans and large carnivores hinders carnivore conservation worldwide. Livestock depredations by large carnivores is the main cause of conflict, triggering poaching and retaliatory killings by humans. Resolving this conflict requires an understanding of the factors that cause large carnivores to select livestock over wild prey. Individual studies to date report contradictory results about whether wild prey density affects livestock depredation by large carnivores. 2. We carried out a systematic review of grey wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences. We reviewed and analysed 119 grey wolf dietary studies from 27 countries to determine whether wild prey or livestock density affects grey wolf dietary selection. 3. We also assessed whether there are traits that predispose species to be preyed upon (body size, group size, defence mechanisms, speed), and whether livestock management is a factor that affects selection of livestock by grey wolves. 4. Overall, wild prey (65% of the total frequency of occurrence in all reviewed grey wolf diet studies) was selected for even when livestock was abundant. The average proportion of biomass percentage in grey wolf diets was 13% for livestock and 19% for wild species. 5. Wild prey species in possession of defence mechanisms (horns, antlers, spikes, and fangs), with high body weight and present in high density were more likely to be depredated by grey wolves. 6. Even when prey abundance significantly affected selection of wild prey, livestock predation was much lower considering their substantially higher density. Areas where livestock were left to graze freely in small numbers (<20 individuals/km2) were more vulnerable to grey wolf attacks. 7. Our results suggest that the adoption of attack prevention measures on pastures and the increase of wild prey abundance could reduce depredation on livestock by grey wolves, and in turn, provide better opportunities for coexistence between humans, grey wolves and livestock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation and Feeding ecology and Human-wildlife conflict and Prey selection and Wolf diet and Canidae and Canis lupus and canid and carnivore and coexistence and conservation management and dietary intake and livestock farming and nature-society relations and prey availability and prey selection","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108433","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108433",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

However, trees may also have a negative effect on fodder production. Such trade-offs between productivity and sustainability in farming are poorly understood, especially in high-latitude areas. We studied hay production in two sites in the same wooded meadow in western Norway, one restored 6 years earlier than the other, to examine whether there were differences in hay production over a 4-year pollarding cycle. We measured production in transects starting from the trunks of pollarded and non-pollarded (reference) trees and running out into open meadow, and transects entirely in open meadow. We examined whether pollarding influenced hay production, and whether hay production was related to the distance from the tree trunk. Total production differed between the two sites, indicating that both time since restoration and differences in overall tree influence affected hay production. We observed a strong and immediate pollarding effect (increase in hay production) due to reduced tree influence. Trees have a negative influence on production as demonstrated by the increase in hay production with increasing distance from the tree trunk. However, additional dry fodder produced by harvesting leaves from pollarded trees more than compensates for reduction in hay production under pollarded trees. Moreover, the understorey production in the wooded hay meadow is at the same level as fertilized meadows in Norway when we include the fodder consumed by sheep during spring and autumn grazing. A wooded hay meadow is an environmentally friendly production system that does not compromise food production. Its tree component can also play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and supports higher biodiversity than industrial food production systems. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Canopy cover and Management and Plant-plant interactions and Pollarding and Production and Tree-influence and Norway and agricultural production and agroforestry and alternative agriculture and biodiversity and climate change and farming system and food production and meadow and sustainability and trade-off and understory","10.1007/s10457-020-00570-x","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-020-00570-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"
"355","rayyan-674265570","What shapes Eurasian lynx distribution in human dominated landscapes: selecting prey or avoiding people?","ECOGRAPHY","In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey - the roe deer - and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (1997-2006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.","HOME-RANGE SIZE and HUMAN DENSITIES and MANAGEMENT and PREDATORS and CONSERVATION and SUITABILITY and POPULATION and NORWAY and POLICY and RULES","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05712.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05712.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Conifer monocultures have been favoured in forest management during the last decades. Recently, concern has risen that forests consisting of only one tree species could be vulnerable to biotic damage. Additionally, environmental and societal changes are placing new demands on forest utilization, thus shifting the focus to alternative forest management options providing a wider scale of ecosystem services. It has been proposed that mixed forests are better than monocultures with respect to biodiversity, risk management and recreational value. By synthesising research studies, we provide an overview of current knowledge on how to combine wood production and other ecosystem services in mixed boreal forests in Fennoscandia. We addressed the following questions in more detail: what are the effects of mixed forests on soil properties, understorey vegetation, biodiversity, wildlife, resistance to and resilience against damage, forest productivity and the multiple use of forests? Furthermore, what are the silvicultural possibilities for establishing and managing mixed forests? Based on this review, mixed forests appear to provide a higher output of most ecosystem goods and services, including higher biodiversity and improved risk management, soil properties and multiple-use values. The most serious challenge is the browsing by cervids, which damages sapling stands. There is potential to establish single-storied mixed forests with current regeneration methods and material.

The patchy distribution and varying quality and diversity of forage on such unimproved lands may affect cattle productivity. Weight gain of 336 beef cows and 270 calves free-ranging during three summer grazing seasons was monitored in boreal forests of south-eastern Norway, stocked at either high (0.16 cows ha(-1)) and low (0.04 cows ha(-1)) stocking densities. We used linear mixed effect models for assessing intrinsic correlates of weight gain in cows and calves in the two areas. Habitat use and home range size of a subsample of 53 cows were monitored by using GPS collars programmed to log locations at 5 min. intervals during the grazing season. Additional extrinsic correlates of weight gain for the subsampled cows using a linear mixed model were also tested. Average weight gain of beef cows grazing at the low stocking density was positive among cows of early maturing breeds (represented by Hereford) gaining 24 +/- 2.8 kg (+/- SE), while cows of late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais) had an average weight loss of 9 +/- 8.4 kg. The average weight gain was negative for beef cows of both early (Herefords) and late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais but also Limousin and Simmental) at the high stocking density. Within both breed groups, there was a negative relationship between breed-specific average weight of cows at turnout and weight gain during the grazing period, while a prolonged grazing period was slightly positively related to weight gain. There was no relationship between weight gain and home range size and proportion of grazing habitat for the 53 cows fitted with GPS collars. Higher weight gains in calves of the low compared to the high stocking density area was found. However, there was no breed effect of weight gain in calves. Across study areas, spring-born suckler calves gained more weight than autumn-born calves (92 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 65 +/- 4.4 kg). Also, there were higher weight gains for spring-born bull-calves than spring-born heifers (100 +/- 2.4 kg vs. 94 +/- 2.2 kg). Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to achieve acceptable weight gains for cattle grazing coniferous forest by finding breeds suitable for these extensive areas and stocking at moderate densities.","Growth and extensive grazing and boreal forest and beef cows and suckling calves and HOME-RANGE and LIFETIME PERFORMANCE and CARCASS COMPOSITION and LANDSCAPE EXAMPLES and WINTER NUTRITION and MEAT QUALITY and BODY-WEIGHT and BREED TYPE and BEHAVIOR and PASTURE","10.1016/j.livsci.2020.103955     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.103955",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Veteran trees are keystone structures and hotspots for biodiversity, and are a potential source of natural enemies. To explore this, we used a balanced experimental design where we measured predatory beetle diversity and attack marks on three colors of artificial caterpillars placed around 20 veteran oaks and 20 nearby young oaks, in Southern Norway. We predicted that around the veteran oaks there would be a greater diversity of predatory beetles and more invertebrate attacks on artificial caterpillars. Sampling for predatory beetles was conducted in summer 2017 and 2018, and invertebrate attacks were measured in 2018. We found support for the predictions: diversity of predatory beetles was higher around veteran trees and there were more arthropod attack marks on artificial caterpillars placed around veteran trees. Our results indicated that veteran trees are a source of natural enemies.

For this reason, alternative silvicultural programs need to be evaluated with respect to their implications for forest biodiversity, especially if these programs are likely to be adopted. Here we simulated the effect of varied rotation length and associated thinning regimes on habitat availability in Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests, with high and low productivity. Shorter rotation lengths reduced the contribution made by production trees (trees grown for industrial use) to the availability of key habitat features, while concurrently increasing the contribution from retention trees. The contribution of production trees to habitat features was larger for high productivity sites, than for low productivity sites. We conclude that shortened rotation lengths result in losses of the availability of habitat features that are key for biodiversity conservation and that increased retention practices may only partially compensate for this. Ensuring that conservation efforts better reflect the inherent variation in stand rotation lengths would help improve the maintenance of key forest habitats in production forests.","Dead wood and Large trees and Rotation length and Thinning and Tree retention and PINUS-SYLVESTRIS and DEAD WOOD and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and NORWAY SPRUCE and EUROPEAN FORESTS and SOUTHERN SWEDEN and BOREAL FORESTS and BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY and SWEDISH FORESTS and PICEA-ABIES and Trees","10.1007/s13280-017-0909-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0909-7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gradients in species composition, found separately for aquatic and terrestrial species by parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations, were interpreted by correlation and geostatistical analyses. The main gradients in species composition given by the first DCA ordination axes for aquatic and terrestrial species were strongly correlated, and both were related to water chemical and geographical variables. The second gradient in aquatic species composition was only weakly related to explanatory variables while for terrestrial species the second axis (like the first) was related to geographical, water chemical and some anthropological impact variables. The spatial structure of most explanatory variables was relatively weak, with a range of influence of 3-6 km. Species composition gradients and species richness variation of the investigated ponds and pond margins were thus to a large extent explained by the same variables. Like species richness, species composition was relatively weakly related to recorded explanatory variables. These two main characteristics of the investigated ecosystem thus both underpin the view that apparent randomness is important in this ecosystem and that ponds and their adjacent margins represent islands in the agricultural landscape that accumulate species more or less individualistically.

"362","rayyan-674259574","Balancing different forest values: Evaluation of forest management scenarios in a multi-criteria decision analysis framework","FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS","Besides traditional timber production, other forest functions, such as biodiversity and recreation, have gained increasing importance during the last few decades. Demands on forests have become more diversified, thus making forest management and planning more complex. To meet these challenges, there is a growing interest in a more diversified silviculture, for which a number of different management options are available. However, it remains unclear how the various management options affect economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable forest management. Hence, in this study, we assess the consequences of various management options on different aspects of sustainable forest management through scenario analysis using a forestry decision support system. We evaluate 10 different forest management scenarios for two contrasting municipalities in Sweden, based on expert participation by way of a web-based multi-criteria decision analysis framework. We asked experts in economic, ecological, and social forest values, as well as those in reindeer husbandry, to weigh a number of indicators in their field of expertise against each other, and to create value functions for each indicator. We then determined scenario ranking for different sets of weights for economic, ecological and social forest values. Our results indicate that current management practices are favorable for economic aspects (wood production), while a number of scenarios would be better suited to fulfill the Swedish co-equal forest policy goal of production and consideration of environmental issues, such as scenarios with longer rotation periods, a larger share of set-asides and a higher share of continuous cover forestry. These measures would be beneficial not only for ecological values, but also for social values and for reindeer husbandry. Furthermore, we found that expert participation through the web-tool was a promising alternative to physical meetings that require more commitment in terms of time and resources.","Multi-criteria decision analysis and Value functions and Expert participation and Forest management scenarios and Sustainable forest management and CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION and MULTIPLE CRITERIA and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and SUPPORT and BIODIVERSITY and STRATEGIES and ENHANCE and POLICY","10.1016/j.forpol.2017.07.002     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.07.002",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

In fulfilling this dual role, the agricultural sector often faces competing pressures: to operate financially profitable businesses and to create, maintain, and benefit from ecosystem services (ES) in their operations. This paper analyses these pressures in an examination of drivers and barriers to the initiation of the business model innovation process for sustainability (BMIpfS) as perceived by ten agricultural business managers who operate farms in southern Sweden. The paper explores the interplay between managerial cognition and business decisions as revealed in semi-structured interviews. The new ES in focus connect to radical land-use change, paludiculture, as used in the rewetting of farmland intended to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that drained peat soil causes. The paper contributes to the literature by identifying drivers and barriers that moderates the initiation of the BMIpfS. Although the managers acknowledge the importance of long-term, sustainable social, and environmental value creation, they have grave doubts about the profitability of activities associated with the preservation of peat soils and connected ES. These managers would benefit from taking a more proactive, long-term approach to business model changes for sustainability and from acquiring more knowledge about market demand for sustainability-oriented ES. Successful facilitation and implementation of knowledge transfer and government subsidies that support ES could improve the turning of profits based on sustainable value creation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agricultural businesses and Business model innovation process and Ecosystem services and Rewetting of peat soils and Sustainable value creation and Sweden and agricultural land and cognition and ecosystem service and facilitation and greenhouse gas and innovation and market conditions and peat soil and profitability and rewetting and sustainability","10.1007/s10668-022-02389-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02389-1",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Trees are set aside for biodiversity purposes at multiple scale levels varying from individual trees to areas of thousands of hectares, with landowner responsibility at the lowest level and with increasing state involvement at higher levels. Ecological theory supports the multi-scaled approach, and retention efforts at every harvest occasion stimulate landowners' interest in conservation. We argue that the model has large advantages but that in a future with intensified forestry and global warming, development based on more progressive thinking is necessary to maintain and increase biodiversity. Suggestions for the future include joint planning for several forest owners, consideration of cost-effectiveness, accepting opportunistic work models, adjusting retention levels to stand and landscape composition, introduction of temporary reserves, creation of ""receiver habitats"" for species escaping climate change, and protection of young forests.","Conservation planning and Cost-effectiveness and Key habitat and Matrix and Reserve and Tree retention and BEETLE DIVERSITY and TREE RETENTION and BOREAL FOREST and NORWAY SPRUCE and KEY HABITATS and HIGH STUMPS and OLD-GROWTH and CLEAR-CUTS and SELECTION and MANAGEMENT and Biodiversity","10.1007/s13280-010-0071-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-010-0071-y",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

This requires compositionally and structurally functional networks of representative habitats, the processes that maintain them, and resilient ecosystems. The term green infrastructure (GI) captures this. We review (1) policy concerning forest biodiversity conservation from the 1990s; (2) the implementation outputs, including the formulation of short-term and evidence-based long-term goals for protected areas, education, and the development of hierarchical spatial planning; (3) the consequences in terms of formally protected and voluntarily set-aside forest stands, as well as conservation management and habitat restoration. We assess the successes and failures regarding policy, outputs and consequences, discuss challenges to be addressed, and suggest solutions. Policies capture evidence-based knowledge about biodiversity, and evidence-based conservation planning as an output. However, the desired consequences are not met on the ground. Thus, the amount of formally protected and voluntary set-aside forests are presently too low, and have limited quality and poor functional connectivity. GI functionality is even declining because of forestry intensification, and insufficient conservation. Challenges include limited collaborative learning among forest and conservation planners, poor funding to conserve forest habitats with sufficient size, quality and connectivity, and national politics that ignores evidence-based knowledge. As solutions, we highlight the need for diversification of forest management systems with a landscape perspective that matches forest owner objectives and regional social-ecological contexts. This requires integrative approaches to knowledge production, learning and spatial planning. © 2023 by the authors.","connectivity and disturbance regimes and forest policy and green infrastructure and habitat network and multi-functional landscape and nature restoration and protected areas and social system and spatial planning and Sweden","10.3390/land12051098","https://doi.org/10.3390/land12051098",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

In northern Sweden, forests provide important benefits including climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, reindeer husbandry, local livelihoods, and recreation. Informed by local stakeholders’ views on how forests can be enabled to deliver these benefits, we created four forest management scenarios: the close-to-nature scenario (CTN) which emphasises biodiversity conservation, the classic management scenario (CLA) optimising the forests’ net present value, the intensified scenario (INT) maximising harvested wood from the forest, and the combined scenario (COM) applying a combination of measures from the CTN and INT. The scenarios were applied to the local forest landscape and modelled over a 100-year simulation period, and the results of the modelling were then evaluated by a diverse group of stakeholders. For most ecosystem services, there was a time lag of 10–50 years before noticeable effects and differences between the scenarios became evident, highlighting the need to consider both the short- and long-term effects of forest management. Evaluation by the stakeholders put the modelled results into a local context. They raised considerations relating to wildlife and hunting, climate change risks, social acceptability, and conflict, highlighting the value of evaluating the scenarios qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Overall, stakeholders thought that the CTN and CLA scenarios promoted more ecosystem services and posed fewer climate risks, while also creating less conflict among stakeholders. Our results emphasise the value of combining scientific and local knowledge when developing and evaluating future forest scenarios. © 2023 The Authors","Forest management and Indigenous and local knowledge and Inter- and transdisciplinary research and Knowledge co-production and Scenario modelling and Stakeholder participation and Trees","10.1016/j.ecoser.2023.101512","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2023.101512",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

To investigate predictive factors for such conflicts in southern Sweden, a questionnaire was sent to 132 NIPF owners with woodland key habitat (WKH; identified biodiversity values). The response rate was 77% and conflict was reported by 22.5% of respondents, while 14% reported good relations with authorities. The respondents reported conflict due to rules for cutting, protection and compensation. Compared with other owners, those reporting conflict were younger (mean 54 versus 62 years old), had more negative opinion about the personal contact with the authority, had twice as large an area of WKH and had more negative opinion about the WKH. Logistic regression revealed four variables that predicted conflict: area of WKH on property, opinion about WKH, opinion about personal contact and, especially, age of respondent. Younger forest owners may be more dependent upon income from harvesting than older owners.

This practice can negatively affect biodiversity conservation planning if natural resource harvest is merely pushed across political borders. As an example, we focus on the boreal forest ecosystem of Finland and northwest Russia. While the majority of protected forests are in northern Finland, the majority of biodiversity is in southern Finland, where protection is more difficult due to high private ownership, and the effectiveness of functioning conservation networks is more uncertain due to a longer history of land use. In northwest Russia, the current protected areas are inadequate to preserve most of the region's naturally dynamic and old growth forests. Increased importation of wood from northwest Russia to Finland may jeopardize the long-term viability of species in high diversity conservation areas in both Russia and Finland, through isolating conservation areas and lowering the age of the surrounding forest mosaic. The boreal forest ecosystem of Fennoscandia and northwest Russia would thus be best conserved by a large scale, coordinated conservation strategy that addresses long-term conservation goals and wood consumption, forest industries, logging practices and trade.

Conservation decisions have implications for different stakeholders and typically draw on multidisciplinary knowledge bases, incorporating natural, physical and social sciences, politics and ethics. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a potentially important tool for supporting conservation policy decisions. This article reports a spatially referenced MCDA of policy instrument scenarios for conserving forest biodiversity in Southwestern Finland. The effects of the realistic policy instruments designed in dialogue with stakeholders included voluntary permanent conservation, enforced spatially concentrated permanent conservation, voluntary permanent conservation with active nature management, and voluntary temporary conservation. These instruments were compared by combining forest-owner survey, MCDA and ex ante impact evaluation. The main objective was to find the forest biodiversity conservation instrument that would produce the highest total benefit. The effects of the different instruments were evaluated with ecological, economic, social, and institutional criteria after a 20-year time period. The results showed minor differences between the instruments, with voluntary permanent and voluntary temporary conservation producing the largest total benefit. Despite the small differences, the analysis was robust in showing that voluntary instruments were more favourable than enforced permanent conservation.","Biodiversity and Conservation and Forest management and MCDA and Policy instruments and Spatial analysis and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and PREFERENCES and GOVERNANCE and VALUES and Finland and Decision Support Techniques and Trees","10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104460     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104460",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

We compared bryophyte diversity in thirty-seven patches formed by uprooting with that of the undisturbed forest floor in a north Swedish Picea abies forest. (2) Bryophyte diversity and species richness were significantly higher in patches with soil disturbance compared with undisturbed forest floor. Species richness and diversity were highest at intermediate patch ages, but disturbed patches had an altered vegetation composition for at least 100 years. (3) Four causes of high bryophyte diversity in disturbed patches are proposed: (i) uprooting creates space for bryophyte colonization that is free from potential competitors; (ii) disturbed patches have high habitat heterogeneity; (iii) within-patch disturbance continues long after patch formation through erosion from tip-up mound; and (iv) the small patch size implies a short distance to potential sources of bryophyte diaspores which should increase the chance of establishment. (4) Both early and late successional bryophytes establish shortly after an uprooting has occurred. This suggests that no facilitation by early species is necessary before late successional species invade.

To improve the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of biological resources, immediate action is called for to create an international preservation network of free-flowing river systems and to rehabilitate exploited rivers in areas that lack unaffected watercourses.","ECOSYSTEMS and BIODIVERSITY and CONSERVATION and MANAGEMENT and Social Control, Informal and Social Control, Formal","10.1126/science.266.5186.753     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.266.5186.753",NA,NA,"Semi-global",NA,NA

A dam was built downstream of the lakes in 1976 to stop the fluvial dispersion of tailings. Bulk samples were collected from the tailings pond (n = 30), natural sediment sources (n = 7), sandbars (n = 98), and overbank sediments (0-25 cm depth, n = 79) along the 55-km river reach downstream of the mining area. In addition, overbank sediment samples of 1 cm thickness were collected at depth intervals of 1-5 cm in 19 vertical profiles (n = 497). Sedimentological properties were recorded in 17 of the profiles. Chemical analysis (ICP-AES after hot nitric acid or aqua regia extraction) has shown that a minimum of 420000 tonnes of tailings with a median molybdenum content of 80 ppm are presently stored in the fluvial sediments. The major volumes are present in sandbars in a 6 km long, low-gradient reach that acts as a bedload trap under normal flood conditions. However, bedload may be flushed into the steeper reaches by repeated major events. On the floodplains, C-14-dating has shown that the average sedimentation rate in one profile has increased from 0.5 to 4.3 mm/year due to deposition of tailings. Since lateral channel instability has only been detected in a few locations, the floodplains are regarded as semi-permanent sinks for tailings. However, extreme floods that strip off vegetation or undercut the floodplains may increase the availability of tailings from these deposits. The results from the Knabeana-Kvina rivers indicate that construction of weirs may stop the dispersion of bedload-sized contaminated sediments, while construction of dams may be necessary to trap contaminated sediments transported in suspension. In each case the benefit and disadvantages of such constructions must be evaluated according to the local conditions.","sediment, stream transport, provenance and fluvial sedimentation and geomorphology, fluvial features, floodplains and molybdenum and tailings and OVERBANK SEDIMENT and FLOODPLAIN and MORPHOLOGY and CHANNEL and ENGLAND and TYNE and Norway","10.1016/S0169-555X(96)00042-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-555X(96)00042-6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In both cases I quantified timber production as a measure of land acquisition cost and use the ratio between the species richness and timber production as a measure of conservation cost-efficiency. I found a positive correlation between timber production and local species richness of birds as well as beetles, indicating that the forests most valuable for forestry are also the ones most valuable for biodiversity conservation. I used different selection procedures for combining sites in a reverse network to find the minimum set of sites that included all vulnerable species. The minimum set of sites for birds was 30% spruce forest, 30% pine forest, and 40% broad-leaved forest (the three main forest types). The minimum set of sites for the beetles was uniformly distributed along the altitudinal gradient. Both minimum sets were mot cost-efficient for species conservation. I suggest that equal coverage of different productivity classes is more efficient for optimizing biodiversity conservation than over-representing low productivity sites. Less than 1% of Norwegian boreal forests have been protected as nature reserves. The reserve network is fairly representative with respect to altitude, but it is seriously skewed toward low productivity sites. The current network is suboptimal with respect to forest type representativeness, species protection, and cost-efficiency. This is a result of an inefficient strategy of selecting reserve sites and an unfortunate combination of selection criteria.

Sample plots from the National Forest Inventory, covering the entire productive forest area in Norway, were aggregated into 10000 treatment units. Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas. With a real rate of discount of 2.5%, and all the constraints imposed simultaneously, the annual harvest potential was reduced by 30% for the first 10-year period, while the net present value was reduced by 21.5%. The results further demonstrated significant efficiency gains of letting the preservation of old forest be allocated cost-efficiently, compared with a strategy of setting aside an equal portion oil all eligible areas.

However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50−100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at lownor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today.","Norway and Trees","10.14214/sf.479","https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.479",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

However, management regimes differ in their effects on CO, dynamics, so this study was undertaken to assess the effects of various thinning strategies on the following variables: the amount of biofuel produced that could replace fossil fuels; mean annual increment of biomass; the standing biomass. In the present study, 50 blocks of Scots pine (Pinussylvestris L.) and 21 of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), established in young stands in Sweden between 1966 and 1984, were examined. Five different thinning regimes were considered: 'low thinning', 'one heavy thinning', 'thinning from above', 'low thinning + fertilization' and 'unthinned'. In the spruce blocks, there was no significant difference in mean annual increment between the thinning regimes, suggesting that fertilization did not have a positive affect on the aboveground biomass. In the pine blocks, 'low thinning + fertilization' was the most suitable thinning regime, since it led to a significantly larger mean annual increment than the other regimes and the quantity of biofuel produced was also large. 'Unthinned' had the largest standing biomass for both species, which resulted in that 'unthinned' is preferred if the objective is to maximize the standing biomass and thereby the carbon pool.

We monitored 10 radio-collared lynx in central Norway in two seasons that differed in ungulate distribution and density. According to the 'optimal foraging theory' an animal should preferentially utilise areas with more abundant food if not constrained by other factors; therefore we predicted that lynx should select patches containing livestock. Contrary to our prediction the results indicate no selection for livestock patches in any season. In contrast, a clear preference was shown for roe deer patches in both seasons. Our findings support the hypothesis that lynx depredation on livestock seems to be affected by chance encounter rates, rather than by active selection for livestock-dense patches. We conclude that habitat selection by lynx seemed to be governed by a number of other factors than food alone, and that lynx predation on livestock, especially on sheep, should not be regarded as being ecologically equivalent to predation on wild prey.",NA,"10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[63:DTSDOL]2.0.CO;2","https://doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[63:DTSDOL]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

Roe deer, the major food source of lynx in the study area, occurred at higher densities closer to areas of human activity and infrastructure. Proximity of lynx locations to human activity and infrastructure was used as a risk index because the most common causes of death among Scandinavian lynx were of anthropogenic origin. This study shows that distances from lynx locations to human activity were significantly greater for females with newborn kittens than for males, but this decreased with kitten age. The data suggest that this response to human activity is influenced by the reproductive strategies of males and females, and might explain male-biased human-induced mortality in this study and in carnivores more generally.","Eurasian lynx and risk taking and human-dominated landscape and reproductive status and attractive sinks and CARNIVORES and NORWAY and POPULATIONS and SPAIN and Humanities and Humanism and Humans and Risk-Taking","10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00107.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00107.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures that aim at increasing the substrate availability for red-listed (species that are threatened, near threatened or where species probably are threatened but data is deficient) saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) organisms. We modelled stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three regions of Sweden by using computer simulations and a database with substrate requirements of saproxylic beetles and cryptogams on the Swedish Red-List. Conclusions concerning cost-effectiveness of silvicultural measures depend on the extinction thresholds of the species they are intended to conserve; measures that generate only small amounts of coarse woody debris (CWD) may provide too little substrate to be useful for species with high extinction thresholds. In northern Sweden, forestland is relatively inexpensive, so a cost-effective strategy to increase the amount of spruce CWD was to set aside more forests as reserves. In central and southern Sweden, more emphasis should instead be given to increasing the amount of CWD in the managed forest. The regulations by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) could be made more cost-effective by prescribing creation of more high stumps and retention of larger amounts of naturally dying trees. Large-sized CWD, CWD from slow-growing trees, and CWD in late decay stages are substrate types that were particularly rare in managed forest in relation to unmanaged forests. Manual soil scarification and retention of living trees are measures that can increase the proportion of these underrepresented CWD types. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We analysed the persistence of five model species inhabiting dead wood. By parameterising a metapopulation model (the incidence function model), the model species were all assigned characteristics that makes it likely that they have disappeared from some (20%) forest landscapes with a long history of forest management. In the metapopulation model, a forest stand (5 ha) was regarded as a habitat patch. The amount of habitat in each patch was obtained from models of dead wood dynamics of Norway spruce in central Sweden. Dead wood generated by altered management over the entire landscape was found to be less efficient in reducing extinction risks in comparison to the same amount of dead wood generated by protecting reserves. Because generation of dead wood by altered management is often less expensive than setting aside reserves, it is difficult to determine which conservation measure is most cost-efficient. In a landscape subjected to forestry for the first time, it was better to preserve a few large reserves than many small ones. However, in a managed, highly fragmented forest landscape it was better to set aside many small reserves. The reason for this was that small plots with high habitat quality could be selected, while large reserves originally contained habitats both of high and low quality, and the rate of habitat quality increase was low. A strategy for biodiversity conservation in a managed forest landscape should include information about the history of the landscape, the current amount and spatial distribution of forest habitats, and the potential for rapid restoration of forest habitats, both on managed and unmanaged forest land.","coarse woody debris and extinction debt and population viability analysis and restoration and saproxylic and SLOSS and DEAD WOOD and COLONIZATION PATTERNS and HABITAT REQUIREMENTS and SPRUCE and BIODIVERSITY and FRAGMENTATION and RESTORATION and MANAGEMENT and VIABILITY and Trees","10.1007/s10980-005-5222-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-5222-3",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Nowadays wolverines in Scandinavia are found in remote high alpine areas, and we investigated whether human development through presence of infrastructure has relegated them to these areas. We analysed wolverine habitat selection and the impact of infrastructure in two study areas in Norway using compositional analysis. We found that alpine tundra with low human development was important for wolverines to locate their home ranges. Human development formed a more important factor for home range location than did habitat, because habitat selectivity was much higher in undeveloped habitats than in developed habitats. Within their home ranges, wolverines used alpine shrubland and forest, irrespective of human development. The sympatric distribution of wolverines with wild and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus indicates that wolverines are vulnerable to indirect loss of habitat. However, we hypothesise that wolverine distribution may be partly influenced by direct disturbance or higher risk of human-caused mortality associated with infrastructure. Increased human development and activity in once remote areas may thus cause reduced ability of wolverines to perform their daily activities unimpeded, making the habitat less optimal or causing wolverines to avoid the disturbed area. Our results suggest that the potential exists for further wolverine recovery in forest ecosystems with low levels of infrastructural development.","compositional analysis and Gulo gulo and habitat use and home range location and human development and infrastructure and Norway and wolverine and HOME-RANGE and REINDEER and CARIBOU and ROADS","10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[285:IOIOHS]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2006)12[285:IOIOHS]2.0.CO;2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

The number of high stumps created on clearcuts was recorded and the beetle fauna under the bark of high stumps of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Out of the 29 beetle species most frequently found in the landscape, high stumps were the major source of recruitment at the landscape level for only one, Hadreule elongatula (Gyllenhal). For the remaining 28 beetle species, less than 1% of the landscape's population occurred in high stumps on clearcuts. The abundance of H. elongatula increased with the area of the surrounding forest land that was covered by clearcuts within a radius of 1000 m. This is the first example of a saproxylic species associated with clearcuts, in contemporary forest landscapes, for which such an occurrence pattern has been documented.","COARSE WOODY DEBRIS and DEAD WOOD and HABITAT REQUIREMENTS and SPRUCE and COLEOPTERA and MANAGEMENT and DYNAMICS and ECOLOGY and ASPEN and FUNGI","10.1139/X06-119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/X06-119",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway, possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world. The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators, large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem productivity in high-density districts.","Alpine and arctic tundra and plant abundance and flower abundance and functional groups and density-dependence and exploitation ecosystems and ecosystem state and herbivore overabundance and grazing and ungulate management and LITTER DECOMPOSITION and NITROGEN DYNAMICS and MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES and VEGETATION CHANGES and COMMUNITY ECOLOGY and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and REINDEER and TUNDRA and CARIBOU and RESPONSES","10.1007/s10021-007-9058-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-007-9058-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

The dissolved form of P constitutes 9-93/,, of the total phosphorus (TP) in water, subsurface drainage can contribute 12-60% and surface erosion 40-88% of TP transfer. TP export in small agricultural streams is generally in the range 0.3-6 kg ha(-1) year(-1), with the highest losses in Norway and UK. All four countries are complying with the EU Water Framework Directive and developing a range of measures based on P source with transport controls over P losses. A decreasing trend in TP losses has been detected in agricultural streams following the introduction of measures to reduce erosion in Norway. Average P concentrations in Swedish streams have shown a reduction of nearly 2%, per year since 1993 as a result of measures introduced in southern Sweden. However, in two large rivers in agricultural regions of Sweden, the concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and TP were shown to increase by 0.4% and 0.7% per year, respectively, over the period 1975-2004, possibly as a result of climate change.

Karst.) stand in order to evaluate the effect of thinning regime on C sequestration. At 22 years old, the stand was reduced from 3190 to 2070, 1100 and 820 trees per hectare in four replicates. The N2070 treatment represents the recommended start density in practical forestry, while the other represent a moderate to large reduction in tree number at the present stand age. Aboveground biomass was estimated from single tree measurements of diameter and height based on allometric functions. Litter fall was collected during one and a half years and soil respiration was measured on five occasions during one summer. Ground vegetation was mapped and sampled for biomass, C and N determination. A significant decrease in aboveground tree (including stump-root system) C storage of 27% and 22% due to thinning was found in the N820 and N1100 treatments, respectively, compared to the N2070 treatment. Ground vegetation C storage was little affected by treatment, while litter fall C showed a non-significant decrease in the N820 and N1100 treatments compared to the N2070 treatment. Soil respiration was significantly lower in parts of the summer in the N2070 treatment compared to the N820 treatment. The reason for this is still unexplained since no differences in soil temperature, soil moisture or litter fall chemistry was found between the treatments. No significant treatment effects on humus and mineral soil C storage could be detected. With the present soil variability, the time period of 32 years is probably too short to detect soil C differences due to thinning. The N storage followed the same pattern as for C.

Studies on soil microarthropod communities in old, traditional, multifunctional farmland, and studies on secondary succession following marginalization and abandonment of traditional farmland are lacking in Europe. Thus, we studied patterns of microarthropod communities related to different land use regimes in a traditional farm in Western Norway. Soil mesofauna communities were analysed at four sites: site OM - old, herb rich, open hay meadow in traditional use; site F1 - abandoned hay meadow with pollarded trees (first fallow); site F2 - deciduous woodland (abandoned hay meadow with old pollards, heavily overgrown, second fallow); and site RM - restored hay meadow with scattered, newly pollarded trees. The abundance of the taxa varied considerably between habitats (for instance: total microarthropods - from 112.4 +/- 11.4 to 29.2 +/- 3.4, Acari - from 83.9 +/- 10.2 to 15.6 +/- 1.8 and Oribatida - from 68.6 +/- 9.5 to 8.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(3) m(-2), for OM and RM sites respectively). The abundance of total Acari, total Oribatida, Oribatida adults and juveniles differed significantly between OM-F1, OM-RM, OM-F2 and RM-F2 sites and it was significantly correlated with continuity of land use and/or tree cover. Oribatida was the group with the highest densities and percentage dominance (except RM site). The percent contribution of total Oribatida in Acari abundance was negatively correlated with the percentage of Actinedida. Nine Ptyctimina species, six Nothroidea species and four Uropodina species were detected, but most of them occurred as single individuals. Abundance of three Ptyctimina [Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus (C.L. Koch), Phthiracarus ferrugineus (C.L. Koch), P globosus (C.L. Koch)], and two Uropodina [Trachytes pauperior Berlese and Dinychus perforatus Kramer] species differed significantly between some sites. The percentage similarity (Renkonen index) has a high indicative value for measuring the distance between ecosystems with apparently similar communities of Uropodina. The OM and RM sites differed most and site pairs - F1-F2 and F1-RM were the most similar. The densities of some taxa were about two-or three-fold greater for the F1site than the RM site. Ratios of Acari to Collembola, total Oribatida to Collembola and total Oribatida to Actinedida were highest on OM site (3.2, 2.6, 11.8 respectively) and decreased in the following order: F2>F1>RM (as an example, total Oribatida to Actinedida ratios were 9.8 on F2 site, 6.2 on F1 and 3.1. on RM). These ratios differed significantly between the OM and RM sites. The lowest ratios on RM site are probably an effect of recent disturbance (change of land use) of this site. Our results suggest that soil in OM site, despite constant disturbance during long time (scything, hay raking and sheep grazing), has probably a stable mesofauna community with the highest abundance of Oribatida. Our results have provided new knowledge about ecosystems in traditional farmland and can be used in monitoring programmes of post-arable land.","mites and land use and soil monitoring and extensive management and SPECIES COMPOSITION and ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION and ORIBATID MITES and ORGANIC-MATTER and BIODIVERSITY and ACARI and CLASSIFICATION and INVERTEBRATES and SUCCESSION and MANAGEMENT",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species’ selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1·5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications . A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.","Norway and Ecosystem","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01527.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01527.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In Norway, there are growing concerns about the effect of releasing 2.1 million domestic sheep (Ovis aries) for summer grazing into areas hosting wild populations of alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We quantified the effect of sheep grazing (0, 25 and 80 sheep/km(2)) on the development in coverage and abundance of plants known to be important in the diet of reindeer during summer (vascular plants) and winter (lichens) within a fully replicated, landscape scale (2.7 km(2)) experiment. From 2001 to 2005, the sedge, Carex bigelowii, increased while the herb Solidago virgaurea decreased in frequency at high density of sheep relative to controls (both marginally non-significant). There was no marked development in Deschampsia flexuosa, Salix herbacea or Hierarcium alpinum that could be related to sheep grazing intensity. Lichen coverage and height both decreased at high density of sheep from 2002 to 2005. Effects of low grazing intensity were closer to controls than to high grazing intensity. Our study highlights that high sheep grazing intensity induce changes to the plant community that, at the same time, can improve the summer habitat and detriment the winter habitat to reindeer. Many wild reindeer populations are fragmented and may thus be limited by either summer or winter range. The effect of sheep grazing is predicted to vary accordingly. However, currently, we have limited ability to quantify how much this explicitly means in terms of increased or reduced carrying capacity for reindeer.",NA,"10.1007/s10344-008-0171-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0171-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.","Alces alces and bioeconomics and Canis lupus and harvesting and migration and moose and sustainable development and wolf and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and SEASONAL MIGRATION and FOREST DAMAGE and BODY-MASS and MORTALITY and PATTERNS and AGE and DYNAMICS and DENSITY and SENESCENCE","10.2981/06-084     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/06-084",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Conceptual work / scenarios"

The pollen record from the lake indicates that there was a decrease in arboreal pollen (AP) by the end of the Mesolithic period (ca. 4200 cal B.C.), and that a substantial forest clearance occurred during the Bronze Age (ca. 1500 cal B.C.). The latter, together with grazing indicators and cereals, suggests a widespread establishment of farming. At the beginning of the Roman Iron Age there is an increase in heath communities. The pollen diagram from the peat/soil profile shows the forest clearance in the Bronze Age more clearly than the lake profile. This local pollen diagram is compared with modern pollen samples from mown and grazed localities in western Norway. Both analogue matching and ordination (PCA) indicate that the site was characterised by pastures and cereal fields from the Late Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. An expansion of cereal cultivation took place during the Pre-Roman Iron Age, and an arable field was established at the site after ca. A.D. 800.

Cruise ships make landings all around the archipelago, and there are numerous snowmobile, boat and hiking excursions. We describe disturbance effects on the three geese species that breed in Svalbard: the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the light-bellied brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). All three are regarded as highly vulnerable to disturbance. Behavioural responses by geese to humans on foot were analysed by estimating the distances at which geese become alerted, the escape flight distances and the length of escape flights, during pre-nesting, nesting and brood-rearing periods. We evaluate the consequences of human intrusion on the reproductive success in breeding colonies. During all three phases, pink-footed geese responded at longer ranges, and flew/ran longer distances, than both brent and barnacle geese: when disturbed on the nest site, both male and female pink-footed geese flew far away, resulting in a high rate of nest loss to avian predators (35%), compared with the 4 and 0% losses among barnacle and brent geese, respectively. During brood rearing, families of pink-footed geese escaped at an average distance of 1717 m, compared with distances of 620 and 330 m for brent and barnacle geese, respectively. Even though bird sanctuaries have been established on several islets, with no human access during nesting, many core areas for the three species remain without restrictions, such as islets used by brent geese and slopes and valleys with nesting pink-footed geese, brood-rearing areas and moulting grounds for non-breeding geese. We propose regulations of human access to goose concentration areas, and address the need to better protect these significant areas.

Full recovery of the original range will require restoration of migration routes across developed or disturbed areas. We analyzed distribution of around 3500 Rangifer tarandus tarandus (reindeer) during winters (1984–2005) in relation to 10 alpine resorts and prior to and following relocation of ski trails and cabins in Norway done to restore use of former habitat. Reindeer used areas within 15 km of resorts, which is less than expected based on the availability of habitat, most likely as a result of cross-country skiing activity surrounding the resorts, limiting their access to other ranges and historic migration corridors. Reindeer abundance declined and mean distance between reindeer groups and resorts increased with increasing resort size. No apparent habituation to resorts was observed during the 20-year study period. However, when ski trails and an associated tourist cabin were removed to restore access to historic habitat, reindeer moved into the area. No such change in reindeer distribution was observed in the 10 years preceding relocation, or at the other nine resorts where no such experiments were conducted.

However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.",NA,"10.1890/08-0576.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/08-0576.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge.

In particular, nest predation has been found to be accentuated in human-modified forest landscapes. In boreal ecosystems, the assemblage of nest predators is likely to be temporally variable. Thus, multi-year predation studies are required in order to highlight the temporal aspects of habitat and edge-specific ground-nest predation. On this basis, we conducted a 3-year predation study in Northern Norwegian mountain birch forests which had been fragmented by spruce plantations. Track boards were used to identify predators in different habitat and edge types. We used logistic regression to assess the importance and consistency of spatial and temporal predictors for the predation rate of six predator species. Total predation rates were high and were higher in the second and third year (range 89.9-96.7%) compared to the first year of the study (range 57.1-75.3%). Mammalian predation decreased while avian predation increased over the 3 years. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and hooded crow (Corvus cornix) were the dominant predators, followed by raven (Corvus corax) and magpie (Pica pica). Pine marten (Martes martes) and stoat (Mustela erminea) predation was low and almost absent in two of the years. Within the study years, predator species exhibited different temporal trends, probably owing to species-specific functional responses. While some edge types were preferred consistently over time by the dominant predators, the spatial pattern of predation was mainly due to unexplained large-scale differences among landscape blocks. This large-scale pattern was constant over the three study years despite the strong temporal fluctuation in predation rates within and between years.","Hooded crow and Red fox and Space-time interaction and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and RED FOX and BREEDING SUCCESS and CORVID DENSITY and SITE SELECTION and HOODED CROWS and GROUND NESTS and BIRDS NESTS and EDGE and LANDSCAPE","10.1007/s10344-009-0253-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-009-0253-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

"414","rayyan-674260370","Spatial patterns of accumulated browsing and its relevance for management of red deer Cervus elaphus","WILDLIFE BIOLOGY","The substantial increase of deer populations in Europe and North America in recent decades has led to concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of current management from an ecosystem perspective. Key questions to be answered are how herbivore density relates to available resource levels, e.g. food availability and browsing pressure, and how this relation should be monitored and included in management. In Norway, the harvest of red deer Cervus elaphus has increased from 1,479 to 35,700 during 1960-2008. Current monitoring programmes focus on deer body mass and number of seen deer rather than on the state of the vegetation communities. In our study, we quantify browsing frequency on common shrubs and trees in two municipalities, Gloppen and Flora, in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, Norway, to document current browsing pressure levels and to evaluate the potential of using browsing frequency of indicator species as a tool in the monitoring of red deer populations. We found that several species were heavily browsed (median browsing frequency > 60%). Due to their wide availability, we analysed the spatial patterns of accumulated browsing of the highly selected rowan Sorbus aucuparia compared to the less selected bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and birch Betula sp. We predicted less spatial variation in browsing frequency of the highly selected rowan. However, we found that the best model predicting browsing on rowan (forest type, habitat productivity, canopy cover, aspect, slope and distance to arable land) based on habitat variables was more complicated than for birch (habitat productivity and altitude) and bilberry (forest type, habitat productivity, altitude and distance from the coast). This suggests large spatial variation in browsing frequency of rowan even though the average browsing frequency of rowan was higher than for bilberry and birch. Browsing frequency for all species was positively correlated with faeces counts, but only bilberry showed additional correlation with red deer (harvest) density at the local management unit scale. Due to its wide distribution and promising link to local red deer density, bilberry stands out as the most promising species to monitor among winter browse species. However, browsing frequency on different species was not always correlated. It remains to be determined to which extent browsing on bilberry can be used as an indicator for the browsing pressure on the whole vegetation community. The documentation of high browsing frequencies clearly suggests that further focus on these issues is warranted.","Cervus elaphus and density dependence and ecosystem management and monitoring and red deer and sustainability and ungulates and MOOSE ALCES-ALCES and LARGE HERBIVORES and DENSITY and SELECTIVITY and INDICATORS and RESPONSES and IMPACTS and SHEEP","10.2981/09-043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2981/09-043",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

In the present study, traffic related contaminants were quantified in tunnel wash water (the Nordby tunnel, Norway) discharged from a sedimentation pond to a nearby small stream, Arungselva. In situ size and charge fractionation techniques were applied to quantify traffic related metal species, while PAHs were quantified in total samples. All metals and several PAHs appeared at elevated concentrations in the discharged wash water compared with concentrations measured in Arungselva upstream the pond outlet, and to concentrations measured in the pond outlet before the tunnel wash event. In addition, several contaminants (e.g. Cu, Pb, Zn, fluoranthene, pyrene) exceeded their corresponding EQS. PAR and metals like Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb were associated with particles and colloids, while As, Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, Sb and Zn were more associated with low molecular mass species (<10 kDa). Calculated enrichment factors revealed that many of the metals were derived from anthropogenic sources, originating most likely from wear of tires (Zn), brakes (Cu and Sb), and from road salt (Na and Cl). The enrichment factors for Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg and Ni were low, suggesting a crustal origin, e.g. asphalt wear. Based on calculated PAH ratios, PAH seemed to originate from a mixture of sources such as wear from tires, asphalt and combustion. Finally, historical fish length measurement data indicates that the fish population in the receiving stream Arungselva may have been adversely influenced by the chemical perturbations in runoffs originating from the nearby roads and tunnels during the years, as the growth in summer old sea trout (Salmo trutta L) in downstream sections of the stream is significantly reduced compared to the upstream sections.

However, although such impacts are expected to be scale-dependent in ecosystems with wide-roaming ungulates, scaling issues rarely enter empirical assessments. We here test the hypothesis that the impact of increased reindeer abundance on plant diversity in alpine tundra is scale-dependent. Based on potentially high productivity of the focal habitat units and hence the possibility of positive grazer impacts on plant diversity we predicted higher alpha and beta diversity at the habitat scale where reindeer densities are high. We also explored whether there were differences in diversity patterns at larger scales, including the scale of reindeer management districts. We estimated grazing disturbance as high versus low reindeer density in selected districts (a total extent of 7421 km(2)) of Northern Norway where reindeer-induced vegetation shifts are debated. We focus on dominance patterns because they can quantify the vegetation state and thus performed additive partitioning of Simpson diversity on multiple scales assessing also species' contributions to diversity. Contrary to our predictions, we found only weak scale-dependent effects of reindeer grazing on plant diversity. Under high reindeer densities there was evidence for a landscape-scale homogenization of the vegetation, but the predicted alpha and beta diversity increases at the habitat scale were not found. Consistently through all scales considered, four shrub species contributed the most to plant diversity. These results contradict the idea that reindeer at high stocking densities induce shifts in plant species dominance in productive habitats. We conclude that context-dependencies such as spatial scales of management units and habitat types need to be explicitly considered in evaluations of the impacts of large ungulates on plant diversity.","grazing and tundra ecosystem and shrub dominance and abundant reindeer and productivity gradients and landscape elements and management scale and Fennoscandia and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY and LARGE HERBIVORES and REINDEER and VEGETATION and MOUNTAINS and PRODUCTIVITY and TRANSITION and MANAGEMENT and FRAMEWORK","10.1007/s10021-009-9308-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-009-9308-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals. Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity. Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals. Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

The aim of this study was to analyse spider assemblages occurring on farmlands with differing stages of land use intensity. We collected the ground-dwelling spider fauna of semi-natural grasslands in currently farmed and abandoned farmland in the alpine zone of Hardangervidda, Norway, using pitfall traps. Trapping during the whole vegetation period resulted in 1,548 individuals belonging to 39 species of spiders. Linyphiids and lycosids dominated. The total number of species differ little between sites, but there was a general trend of increasing proportions of lycosids, gnaphosids and thomisids individuals and species, and a decrease in the proportion of linyphiids with farmland abandonment. Two main groupings of spider assemblages were found using a principal component analysis: One grouping was characteristic of intensely disturbed sites, mainly dominated by typical pioneer species. The other was characteristic of abandoned and less disturbed sites, dominated by widespread species. The abandonment of summer farms led to a succession in spider assemblages, including a decline in spider species with a high ballooning activity and an increase of species with a larger body size. We suggest that the main reason lies in the absence of disturbance by grazing including differing vegetation architecture and the proportion of bare ground with abandonment. Spider assemblages react quickly to environmental changes that occur in alpine habitats after abandonment. Thus, it is necessary to include spiders and other invertebrate animal indicator groups in field studies and experiments dealing with grazing impacts on alpine habitats.","Abandonment and Alpine Ecosystem and Grazing and Pitfall traps and Spiders and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and LAND-USE and VEGETATION and MOUNTAINS and PATTERNS and NORWAY and PSEUDOREPLICATION and COMMUNITIES and LANDSCAPE and GRADIENTS","10.1007/s10841-010-9272-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9272-8",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Our analyses were based upon species data from 2201 patch elements in SE Norwegian modern agricultural landscapes. The context used for measuring habitat specificity strongly influences the results. In general the gamma diversity contribution and core habitat specificity calculated from the patch data set were correlated. High values for both measures were observed for woodland, pastures and road verges whereas midfield islets and boundary transitional types were ranked low, as opposed to findings in traditional, extensively managed agricultural landscapes. This is due to our study area representing intensively used agricultural landscape elements holding a more trivial species composition, in addition to ruderals being favoured by fertility and disturbance, a finding also being supported by the semi-natural affiliation index. Results obtained by use of checklist data from the same study area diverged from patch data. Caution is needed in interpretation of habitat specificity results obtained from checklist data, because modern agricultural landscapes contain several land types which are seldom surveyed by botanists, thus being under-represented in the data set.

To maintain biodiversity and ecological services of semi-natural grasslands, we need more knowledge on the relative performance of different recreation methods. In a replicated experiment in western Norway, we evaluated two hay transfer methods (hard or light raking of local hay), sowing of local seeds and natural regeneration for recreating semi-natural grassland in a road verge. We compared treated trial plots with their respective donor plots (where hay and seeds were harvested) for three successive years by evaluating vegetation cover, species richness and species transfer rates, and vegetation dynamics analysed by Bray-Curtis compositional dissimilarity (BC) and GNMDS (Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling) ordination. Vegetation cover at the trial site exceeded that of donor sites in three years. Transfer rates of common species were high for seed sowing and both hay transfer procedures. Species composition in trial plots for all three treatments became significantly more similar to donor plots, but was still relatively dissimilar after three years. Natural regeneration showed a different temporal pattern and also had a higher successional rate. The species composition of the other treatments followed the same trajectory toward the donor sites as revealed by GNMDS. We found relatively small differences between the two hay transfer methods and seed sowing. Transfer of local hay therefore appears to be a successful method of establishing local species when recreating semi-natural grasslands, and is generally cheaper than using commercial local seed mixtures.

We hypothesized that developed areas would attract predators and lead to higher predation on willow ptarmigan and lower their abundance. In a 500-km(2) study area in south-central Norway, we sampled the density of territorial cocks in spring and the breeding success of willow ptarmigan along a 3-km gradient extending out from clusters of cabins. We also sampled red fox scats and corvid birds and measured nest predation on artificial nests across this gradient. Densities of cocks in the spring and of adults and brood sizes in August did not vary along the gradient. However, the density of chicks in August was higher beyond 1.5 km from cabin areas, presumably because more hens lost their clutches in the vicinity of cabins. This was supported by the results from the artificial nest experiment where significantly more nests were depredated near cabin areas than further away. The number of scats of red fox along trails increased with distance from cabins, whereas more corvid birds were observed near cabins. We conclude that corvid birds were the main cause of higher loss of ptarmigan nests near cabin areas, which led to lower production of chicks. Breeding density, however, did not seem to vary along the gradient, presumably because of suitable habitat for breeding and little human activity in these areas during the period of pair formation and nesting.","Anthropogenic disturbance and Breeding and Willow grouse and Red fox and Nest predation and Small game and HOODED CROWS and TOURISM and CONSERVATION and POPULATION and SPORTS and NESTS and Mountaineering and Norway and Salix and Recreation","10.1007/s10344-010-0378-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0378-9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains","Observational studies"

When converting old forest to clearcuts and plantations, commercial forestry has therefore been assumed to affect capercaillie negatively and to be favourable to black grouse. During a 30-year period (1979-2008) we monitored sympatric populations of the two species in a forest in southeast Norway based on annual spring and autumn censuses and radio-marked birds. During this period, the proportion of old, semi-natural forest was halved and clearcuts and young plantations increased accordingly. The grouse populations did not change as predicted. While the trend in August numbers of adult black grouse declined, males more than females, abundance of adult capercaillie remained unchanged. Number of males at leks showed similar patterns. Equally surprising, breeding success (number of chicks per female in August) of both species increased, thus indicating that the populations were regulated more by variation in adult survivorship than by recruitment of young birds. No correlations were found with changing climatic factors (precipitation and temperatures in winter and spring, snow depth and time of snow melt), except that year-to-year breeding success was positively correlated with minimum temperatures during 2 weeks posthatch. The results are explained by a combination of more flexible habitat selection than previously assumed and a changing predator regime: In the early period, nearly all capercaillie leks were located in old, semi-natural forest, but as plantations grew older (> 30 years), new leks were established there. Similarly, while young capercaillie broods used old semi-natural forest almost exclusively when the study started, they frequently used middle-aged plantations, especially those with a ground cover of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, when these became common in later years. The increasing breeding success could largely be explained by more females rearing chicks successfully, presumably due to a marked decline in the main nest predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes. A practice of thinning of the old, semi-natural forest some years prior to final harvesting probably facilitated predation of black grouse by goshawks Accipitergentilis. Contrary to many beliefs, our results indicate that both capercaillie and black grouse are quite tolerant to changes in forest management regimes. In our study, numerical and functional responses of predators (mainly red fox and goshawk) apparently played a more important role in regulating grouse numbers than habitat factors per se.

"428","rayyan-674262868","Effects of intensified forestry on the landscape-scale extinction risk of dead wood dependent species","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","In the future, a significant proportion of Northern forests may become intensively managed through the planting of monospecific stands of native or introduced trees, and the use of multiple silvicultural treatments such as forest fertilization. Such an intensification of management in selected parts of the landscape is suggested by different zoning models, for example the Triad approach, which is under evaluation in some regions of North America. In this study, based on Fennoscandian conditions, we predicted landscape-scale extinction risks of five hypothetical model insect species dependent on fresh dead wood from Norway spruce (Picea abies), by simulating colonizations and local extinctions in forest stands. Intensified forestry applied to 50% of the spruce stands led to strongly increased extinction risks of all species during the following 150 years. For one species-the sun-exposure specialist-there were strong effects already after 50 years. The negative effects of intensive plantation forestry could be compensated for by taking greater biodiversity conservation measures in other managed forests or by setting aside more forests. This is consistent with the Triad model, which is according to our analyzes an effective way to decrease extinction risks, especially for the short-dispersing species and the species associated with closed forest. A zoning of forest land into intensive forestry, conventional forestry, and set asides may be better at combining increased timber production and maintenance of biodiversity in comparison to landscapes where all production forests are managed in the same way.","CWD and Functional zoning and Metapopulation and Plantation forestry and Population viability analysis and Saproxylic insects and Triad and OLD-GROWTH and HABITAT REQUIREMENTS and CONSERVATION and REGENERATION and DYNAMICS and BIODIVERSITY and CONTINUITY and AVAILABILITY and CONSEQUENCES and COLEOPTERA","10.1007/s10531-011-0143-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0143-8",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA
"429","rayyan-674260147","Introducing Intensively Managed Spruce Plantations in Swedish Forest Landscapes will Impair Biodiversity Decline","FORESTS","Due to pressure to raise forest productivity in Sweden, there are proposals to apply more intensive forestry methods, but they could have potentially large effects on biodiversity. Here we report a compilation and evaluation of the extent and significance of such effects. We evaluated potential effects on biodiversity by introducing intensively fertilized Norway spruce plantations as a management option in Swedish forests with low conservation values on insects, vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes, and red-listed species. Due to a lack of specific studies addressing this question, we based the evaluation on a combination of available and appropriate empiric and anecdotic knowledge; literature data, and expert judgments largely available in species data bases. Our evaluations suggest that such forests will only harbor species that are common and widespread in conventionally managed stands and that species of conservation interest will be lacking, due to the low heterogeneity and light intensity of even-aged monocultures with dense canopies, short rotation times and low availability of coarse woody debris. Effects at the landscape scale are more difficult to evaluate, but will be dependent on the area utilized and the conservation value of sites used. We conclude that negative effects on biodiversity can be reduced if: (1) only land with the lowest conservational value is utilized; (2) plantations are spatially arranged to minimize fragmentation of the landscape; (3) the quality and quantity of key structural elements (e.g., coarse woody debris, old living trees and snags) are maintained at the landscape level; and (4) management intensity is relaxed on other land. For effective implementation of these measures, legislative frameworks and policy instruments need to be adjusted and new models for planning and monitoring need to be developed.","boreal forests and fertilization and land-use change and plantation forests and NORWAY SPRUCE and DEAD WOOD and NORTHERN and GROWTH and CONSERVATION and RETENTION and BIOFUELS and ENERGY and SCALE and Trees","10.3390/f2030610     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3390/f2030610",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Still, the forest canopy was lush green and characterised by large tree-crowns. This situation was referred to as the ""Green lie'' and was advocated by foresters throughout Scandinavia as an argument in favour of forestry practices based on clear-felling. Here we examine effects of past selective loggings on forest structure and composition in a spruce forest landscape using dendroecology and historical records. Our results show that forests that were selectively logged up to the early 1900s could be structurally heterogeneous with multi-layered canopies, varying degree of openness and continuous presence of old trees across different spatial scales. Because the past forests were not clear-felled, a diverse forest structure in terms of tree species composition and age and diameter distribution was maintained over time, which could enable forest-dwelling species to persist during the early phase following the loggings in the past. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in most modern managed forest landscapes in Scandinavia. A better understanding of the link between loggings in the past- and present-day forest structure and diversity will contribute to rewarding discussions on forestry methods for the future.","Biodiversity and dendroecology and forest history and historical records and selective logging and WOOD-INHABITING FUNGI and PICEA-ABIES FOREST and OLD-GROWTH and SPRUCE FORESTS and BEETLES COLEOPTERA and USNEA-LONGISSIMA and MANAGED FORESTS and POPULUS-TREMULA and NORTHERN SWEDEN and BOREAL and Norway","10.1080/02827581.2011.628950     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2011.628950",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

In the present investigation, we assess and quantify structural vegetation changes caused by changes in land use and climate. Up-to-date actual vegetation maps from three rural study areas were compared with interpreted historical vegetation maps and potential natural vegetation (PNV) models. Our findings indicate that the present vegetation structure is strongly influenced by land use. In the studied sites, 56–66% of the areas presently have another vegetation type than expected from a natural state (PNV).

Interpreting factors leading to changes in mountains includes disturbance from human resource use and climate as important factors. The article shows that forest line changes in eastern Jotunheimen, a mountain region in southern Norway, can be related to changes in livestock grazing pressure between the 1960s and 2002. In contrast to other European mountain regions, highly relevant climate variables such as the triterm (the summer months) have not changed in the studied region. Therefore, land-use change is considered the main driver for the forest line shifts observed in the region. However, the predicted climate warming, together with continued trends of decreasing and abandoned free-range grazing of livestock will cause further forest expansion above the present forest lines also in the eastern Jotunheimen mountain range.","climate and ecosystem change and human resource use and land use changes and livestock grazing pressure and CLIMATE-CHANGE and LAND-USE and SPECIES-DIVERSITY and SOUTHERN NORWAY and BUD BURST and TREE and TEMPERATURE and SCENARIOS and LANDSCAPE and DYNAMICS and Mountaineering","10.1080/00291951.2011.644320     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/00291951.2011.644320",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

These problems may be avoided by using land-based fish farms, where effluent quantity and quality are controlled. However, there are several obstacles treating wastewaters from fish farms. This paper presents a theoretical mass balance approach for an experimental land-based salmon farm with a capacity of 780 t fish per year in Orland (64 degrees N), Norway, with particular emphasis on the potential of wastewater treatment with microalgae production. Post microfiltration of the particulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) from the wastewater supplies, approximately 24 t dissolved N and 3 t dissolved P are available for microalgae production per annum. A mean on-site annual photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 265 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) could theoretically yield approximately 100-140 t dry microalgae per hectare and year, thereby sequestering 7-10 t N und 1 t P ha(-1) yr(-1). Thus the entire N and P neutralization from wastewater would require an approximately 3 ha large area. Light is interestingly not a limiting factor, even in Northern Norway. However, with an estimated water effluent flux rate of 1.7 m(3) s(-1) the main challenge is an optimal balance between bioreactor surface exposed to light, water flow, residence time, and nutrient concentrations.","SALMON and FISH and Norway",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

Fright response distances sampled in the field were significantly longer when approached by a snow-kiter than by a skier. A simulation model predicts a different outcome of daytime disturbances for reindeer from free ranging snow-kiters versus skiers confined to prepared ski trails. The expected number of encounters with reindeer increases linearly with increasing number of snow-kiters until it reaches a threshold level and then stabilizes, but the number of snow-kiters reaching a threshold will vary depending on the speed of the kite (252 snow-kiters at 8.8 km h(-1) or 96 at 20 km h(-1)). The relative loss of habitat and daytime feeding for reindeer following encounters with snow-kiters moving randomly within their range increases progressively up to a 100% reduction at 241 or 111 snow-kiters at a speed of 8.8 and 20 km h(-1), respectively. Above this number of snow-kiters, reindeer will not feed and have nowhere to escape. Reindeer progressively reduce up to 7.5% of their daytime feeding until the number of skiers reaches 105. Above 105 skiers and as the number of skiers continues to increase, reindeer find refuge away from ski trails and their feeding time increases and returns to a zero percent reduction at 133 skiers or more. Long fright responses by reindeer towards snow-kiters and potentially very negative population consequences necessitate additional information on snow-kiting activities and appropriate management measures in reindeer habitats.

We conducted controlled crosses and field germination experiments to quantify the effects of inbreeding and outbreeding in the declining orchid Gymnadenia conopsea in two Norwegian populations that differ in size. We further compared our results with published estimates of inbreeding depression in orchids. There was severe inbreeding depression for seed production (delta = 0.41-0.67) and germination (delta = 0.46-0.66) in both populations, with stronger inbreeding depression in the large population. Compared to outcrossing, selfing reduced female fitness (number of seeds per fruit x proportion of seeds germinating) by 76 and 54 % in the large and small population, respectively. The magnitude of inbreeding depression for seed production was higher than the average reported for orchids, while for germination it was similar to earlier estimates. The large population also experienced considerable outbreeding depression for seed production (delta = 0.23-0.27), germination (delta = 0.33) and female fitness (delta = 0.47) following crosses with a population 1.6 km away. The strong inbreeding depression indicates that both populations harbour a substantial genetic load, and suggests that fragmentation may reinforce population decline in G. conopsea via increased inbreeding. Moreover, the local outbreeding depression indicates substantial genetic differentiation at a moderate spatial scale. This has important implications for the use of crosses between populations or plant translocations as conservation approaches.","Conservation genetics and Genetic structure and Habitat fragmentation and Inbreeding depression and Mating system evolution and Outbreeding depression and POPULATION GENETIC CONSEQUENCES and HABITAT FRAGMENTATION and EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES and DECEPTIVE POLLINATION and SPIRANTHES-SPIRALIS and PLANT CONSERVATION and DIGITALIS-PURPUREA and OUTCROSSING RATE and FLORAL DISPLAY and POLLEN FATES","10.1007/s10592-012-0373-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0373-7",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

However, in some swamp forests, the absence of fire over the last 3500 years has promoted the continuous presence of deciduous trees, i.e. Picea has not established although it has been present regionally for over 3000 years. Our objective was to study long-term vegetation development and fire history in a Picea swamp forest located close (c. 600 m) to a deciduous swamp forest with a documented fire-free history in northernmost Sweden. The study included analyses of charred particles, pollen and ignition residues. Principal component analysis was applied to identify major changes in the pollen spectra. Our results showed that the current Picea swamp forest has developed from a deciduous fen and that fires affected the fen between 6700 and 2300 cal. yr BP. Picea abies established on the fen around 2200 cal. yr BP, following the last local on-site fire. The main factors responsible for the local vegetation development have been: fire (6700 to 2300 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes and climate (2300 to 1000 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes or anthropogenic impact (1000 to 300 cal. yr BP); anthropogenic impact through selective cutting and grazing (300 to 100 cal. yr BP); and autogenous processes and grazing (100 cal. yr BP to present). We conclude that fire facilitated the initial Picea abies establishment. Once established, Picea abies created local conditions that in combination with a colder and wetter climate prevented fire and the establishment of other tree species.","charred particles and fire history and loss-on-ignition and pollen and succession and LONG-DISTANCE TRANSPORT and REGENERATION PATTERNS and CHARCOAL ACCUMULATION and MACROSCOPIC CHARCOAL and LATE 21ST-CENTURY and EUROPEAN CLIMATE and TERM CONTINUITY and CENTRAL SWEDEN and ISLAND AREA and SWISS ALPS","10.1177/0959683611414936     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683611414936",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

In this study, the value of retained dead wood and high-cut stumps was evaluated in terms of how much they contribute to the population of the red-listed beetle Peltis grossa in a forest landscape. The evaluation was based on a population estimate before and after restoration started in the study landscape. The restoration started in 1994 with 425 high-cut stumps of Norway spruce on six experimental clear-cuts and continued 4 years later with high-cutting and retention of dead trees becoming a standard measure in the 10 000-ha forest landscape. Ten years after high-cutting, adults of P. grossa started to emerge from the stumps on the experimental clear-cuts and the number of emergence holes was counted each year during the following eight years (2003-2010). During this period, the average yearly recruitment of P. grossa from these stumps were c. 300 individuals, adding up to a total of c. 2250 emergence holes. In 2005, all clear-cuts made during 1990-2000 and random samples of young and old forest stands were inventoried in transects across the landscape. In total, 1219 emergence holes were found in 2005; all of them on the clear-cuts and none in the forest stands. Our study is the first to show that habitat restoration can increase population growth of a threatened saproxylic species on a landscape scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Mountain regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate, and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant communities? Location Southern Scandes, Norway. Methods We use a unique long-term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions. Results We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational advance than species from higher altitudes. Conclusions This study presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the potential to buffer climate-driven shifts in plant communities. Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the vulnerability of alpine communities to warming.","Climate change and Distribution and Grazing and Land use and Livestock and Mountain and Norway and Sheep and Warming and SPECIES RICHNESS and VASCULAR PLANTS and ECOLOGICAL DATA and CLIMATE-CHANGE and SHIFT and PRODUCTIVITY and IMPACTS and BIODIVERSITY and CONTRACTIONS and DEGRADATION","10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01391.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01391.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra.

However, today, the focus of river restoration has shifted towards improving biological functionality and biodiversity. In the present study, two weirs, originally built to create a stable water level, were removed on a residual flow reach in a Norwegian regulated river as a measure to restore river connectivity and to re-establish the local population of Atlantic salmon. The removal design was based on hydraulic modelling, and biological monitoring was implemented before and after the weir removal to evaluate the biological response to weir removal. The results demonstrated that salmon spawning sites were recreated in the old bed substratum and were occupied immediately the first season after weir removal, when water velocities increased to more suitable levels for spawning. Accordingly, mortality of Atlantic salmon eggs was reduced and the densities of juveniles showed a marked increase after weir removal. Conversely, pike and cyprinids in the reach were found in the samples before weir removal but not after removal, indicating that the desired shift in fish community in response to habitat alteration was obtained. Furthermore, enumeration of migrating adult salmon at a fishway upstream of the study reach showed that the migration peak, on average, was 1?month earlier in the 3?years after removal as compared with the 5?years before removal. Finally, the use of hydraulic modelling represented a useful method for designing physical habitat adjustments and assessing their influence on fish biology. The model results also supported a rapid process in planning and execution of construction works.

To better understand the ecosystem's capabilities for recovery we investigated vegetation cover changes over a 7-yr period, starting in 1998, at 52 sites dispersed over a large area at Finnmarksvidda. Two types of plots were established: one fenced from reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period. Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083 +/- 0.011 per year in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time, fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition, lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz, shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were repairable. The vegetation transitions which have taken place in the study area are considered to be reversible with fewer persistent effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a nonmonetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Smola windpower plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-year metric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smola ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site.

The population in the Setesdal Austhei wild reindeer area still migrates from winter to calving grounds by semi-annually crossing a cabin-lined road through a narrow corridor, in which further anthropogenic development is planned. To understand if and how infrastructure affected reindeer migration patterns we studied the movements of 10 female reindeer equipped with GPS collars between 2002 and 2010. First, we identified the start and end of the migration period, and then we compared trajectory parameters (net displacement, step length and turning angles) recorded during migration with those recorded in proximity of the road. The analysis of the net displacement indicated that during spring migration reindeer moved at a constant pace towards the calving ground covering a net linear distance of 25 km in 40 days. In the middle of migration, reindeer changed travel direction and roamed parallel to the road for ca. 5 days without approaching further, possibly searching for an undisturbed place and time to cross. Reindeer finally crossed the road before daylight with highly directed movements, increasing their travel speed up to the highest values recorded during migration (4 km/3 hrs vs. 0.5 km/3 hrs). After crossing, reindeer moved quickly toward their calving ground covering the remaining 25 km net distance in less than a week. Migration patterns were markedly affected by disturbance during spring, as the road crossings occurred in the period characterized by the high traffic volume and intense human activities related to Easter holidays; during autumn, on the contrary, the hampering effect of the road was minimal. The results suggest that the current disturbance associated to the road hampers spring migration and might delay the arrival to the calving ground. The planned construction of a large number of recreational cabins in the migration corridor has the potential to threaten the migration and obstruct the access to the calving ground.

The fields were located in the southeastern (A), central (B) and western (C) parts of Norway. In total, 3945 spiders were caught from May to September 2004, using pitfall traps. Linyphidae was the most numerous family, with Erigone atra Blackwall 1833 representing 56% of all trapped individuals. The total numbers of spider species and individuals were significantly higher in leys than in barley at sites where both crops were present (sites A and B), with on average 11 species and 93 specimens in barley, and 20 species and 393 specimens in leys. Thus, young perennial leys appeared to provide a better habitat for spiders than did cereal fields, as has previously been documented for older perennial leys. The use of multi-species crops instead of a single crop species undersown in cereals, tended to result in higher spider species diversity, but it did not influence the total number of specimens. An ordination (DCA) showed a clustering of the spider fauna from the same site, but no clear separation between main crop types (ley vs. barley) was apparent. The main crops, subcrops, and the surrounding environs of the cropped field seem to affect the diversity and abundance of spiders.","Cereal and community structure and farming and meadow and CEREAL FIELDS and CROPPING SYSTEMS and PEST-CONTROL and LANDSCAPE and HABITAT and WHEAT and RECOLONIZATION and PRODUCTIVITY and PREDATORS and NITROGEN","10.1636/P12-32.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1636/P12-32.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems, Agricultural landscapes","Observational studies"

However, few forests are currently co-managed for timber and wildlife, despite potential economic and conservation benefits. We present empirical data from a commercial Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) production system in southern Norway in which moose (Alces alces) are an important secondary product. Combining long-term hunting and forestry records, we identified temporal variation in clear-felling over the past five decades, peaking in the 1970s. Herbicide treatment of regenerating stands and a fivefold increase in moose harvest has lead to a reduction in availability of successional forest per moose of > 90 % since the 1960s. Field estimates showed that spraying with the herbicide glyphosate reduced forage availability by 60 and 96 % in summer and winter, respectively, 4 years after treatment. It also reduced moose use and habitat selection of young spruce stands compared with unsprayed stands. Together these lines of evidence suggest that forest management led to an increase in moose carrying capacity during the 1970s and a subsequent decline thereafter. This is likely to have contributed to observed reductions in moose population productivity in southern Norway and is counter to sustainable resource management. We therefore call for better integration and long-term planning between forestry and wildlife management to minimise forest damage and the development of large fluctuations in ungulate populations.","Boreal forest and Clear-cut and Deer and Forest vegetation management and Multiple-use forestry and Multi-purpose forest management and GLYPHOSATE-TREATED CLEARCUTS and HABITAT SELECTION and CARRYING-CAPACITY and ALCES-ALCES and SCOTS PINE and BODY-MASS and FORAGE and UNGULATE and VEGETATION and DENSITY","10.1007/s10342-013-0727-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-013-0727-9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

We compared bilberry from mature stands and clear-cuts in a spruce forest landscape in south-central Norway, and applied the following experimental treatments: fertilisation, root cutting and flower removal to evaluate the effect of resource availability. During the second growing season we estimated bilberry shoot biomass as well as flowering and berry production, while bilberry shoots and leaves were collected in early summer and autumn for analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phenolic compound concentrations. The biomass of bilberry shoots was highest on clear-cuts and after fertilisation. All groups of phenolic compounds were also highest on clear-cuts, and phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in non-fertilised plots. Catechins and condensed tannins were highest in autumn, while phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in summer. Removal of flowers and root cutting had no effects. Nitrogen concentrations in shoots were highest in summer, after fertilisation, and when flowers were removed. The amount of flowers was highest in non-fertilised, mature forest sites, while the berry production was not significantly affected by any of the treatments or the site type. Our results indicate that in the studied area, the performance of bilberry is not negatively affected by clear-cutting, it rather seems that the environment on the clear-cuts give the plants abundant resources for enhancements both in growth, reproduction and defence compared with the mature forest sites.

By conducting a nation-wide, interdisciplinary pre-post study on a temporal scale spanning centuries, we modelled current reindeer movements with respect to archaeological findings to quantify long-term changes in area use related to anthropogenic disturbance. The location of 3,113 pitfall traps and hunting blinds, built 600-2000 years ago and used until 350-400 years ago, testified the location of traditional movement corridors. Current movement routes were delineated using Brownian Bridge Movement Models based on 147 reindeer GPS-monitored during 10 years. Using Path Analysis we quantified direct, indirect and total effects of different infrastructures within multiple scales (1, 5, and 10 km-radius buffers) on the current probability of use of ancient movement corridors. Tourist cabins and roads had the strongest long-term direct effects at most scales: 1 tourist cabin and 1 km road within a 1 km-radius buffer would lead, respectively, to complete area abandonment, and to a 46 % decrease in the probability of use. Power lines and private cabins had significant indirect effects on area use through their effect on roads, while hiking trails and, in particular, hydroelectric dams had highly variable effects, not significant at a nation-wide scale.

However, animals sometimes prefer habitats of apparently low quality, especially when considering the costs associated with spatially heterogeneous human disturbance. We used spatial variation in human disturbance, and its consequences on lynx survival, a direct fitness component, to test the Hierarchical Habitat Selection hypothesis from a population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in southern Norway. Data from 46 lynx monitored with telemetry indicated that a high proportion of forest strongly reduced the risk of mortality from legal hunting at the home range scale, while increasing road density strongly increased such risk at the finer scale within the home range. We found hierarchical effects of the impact of human disturbance, with a higher road density at a large scale reinforcing its negative impact at a fine scale. Conversely, we demonstrated that lynx shifted their habitat selection to avoid areas with the highest road densities within their home ranges, thus supporting a compensatory mechanism at fine scale enabling lynx to mitigate the impact of large-scale disturbance. Human impact, positively associated with high road accessibility, was thus a stronger driver of lynx space use at a finer scale, with home range characteristics nevertheless constraining habitat selection. Our study demonstrates the truly hierarchical nature of habitat selection, which aims at maximising fitness by selecting against limiting factors at multiple spatial scales, and indicates that scale-specific heterogeneity of the environment is driving individual spatial behaviour, by means of trade-offs across spatial scales.","Ecosystem","10.1371/journal.pone.0065493","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065493",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

A long-term decline in biological output, loss of ecological integrity, and a fall in the economic worth of the land are all signs of “land degradation”, a downbeat trend in land condition. In the red lateritic zone of the tropical area, where “climate change” and “land degradation” are related, they impact one another. On the other hand, due to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which slow the rate of carbon absorption, and the extent of various existing land degradation processes, which are worsened in pace and magnitude by “climate change”.

The need for additional land for farming, feed, and other forms of production is fuelled by poverty and the destruction of the environment. In tropical regions, “soil erosion” caused by “water and wind, salinization and alkalinity, acidity, losses of organic carbon, nutrient imbalance, pollution/contamination by toxic substances, and soil sealing and capping” all call for immediate action to stop the land degradation process and sustainably restore productivity for environmental security and food security for the world's expanding population.

Properly managing Green Infrastructure (GI) can contribute to mitigating these challenges by delivering multiple provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural Ecosystem Services (ES). This would facilitate the implementation of strategically planned GI networks in cities for urban regeneration purposes. In this context, this study developed a systematic review on the ES provided by GI using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The analysis of 199 eligible articles indicated that more efforts should be made to address more ES at once, which connects to the need for conceiving GI as a strategically planned network of areas aimed at delivering diverse benefits. Based on the methods used in the items reviewed, geoprocessing tools and multi-criteria decision analysis are proposed to develop systems of indicators capable of accounting for multiple ES. These systems should also rely on multidisciplinary and participative procedures to encompass various facets of GI and represent the priorities of all relevant stakeholders. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiversity and Climate change and Ecosystem services and Green infrastructure and Urbanization and accessibility and biodiversity and climate change and decision analysis and ecosystem service and infrastructure planning and literature review and sustainability and urban ecosystem and urbanization","10.1016/j.ufug.2023.127998","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2023.127998",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems",NA

One main reason for this decline is the lack of suitable nesting sites. While some off-field measures showed positive effects on bird productivity, we are currently not achieving sufficient conservation with these, so that supplementing them with in-field measures seems inevitable. Over the past years, several in-field measures have been developed aiming at providing suitable nesting sites in crop fields by manipulating the crop architecture, i.e., the density and/or height of the crops. However, we currently lack an overview on what has been tested and resulted in stabilizing population of ground-breeding farmland birds. In this systematic review, we provide a qualitative assessment of current knowledge and knowledge gaps on such in-field measures and their effects on European crop-breeding farmland birds. In doing so, we accounted for specific birds’ requirements on their breeding habitat. We found only very few studies on the effectiveness of crop architecture-related in-field measures on ground-breeding farmland birds. Knowledge gaps exist for effects on individual species in general, their reproduction (rather than population density), the influence of landscape and local contexts on the effectiveness, and the optimal spatial arrangement of measures to maximize their efficiency. This shows an urgent need for more research on a holistic scale. However, the few existing studies suggest, that there is a high potential for crop architecture-related in-field measures to promote ground-breeding farmland birds, and thus bring them back as ‘agricultural by-products’. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiversity and Conservation and Ecological intensification and Sward heterogeneity and Sward homogeneity and Sward structure and Vegetation density and Vegetation structure and biodiversity and conservation management and environmental assessment and heterogeneity and homogeneity and nature conservation","10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126515","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126515",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

A systematic review of alternative trajectories in Europe","Land Use Policy","Agricultural land abandonment and its impacts on landscape features have been a, striking characteristic of many European rural areas over the last decades. Although, previous research identified drivers and environmental impacts of abandonment, few, described the post-agricultural abandonment trajectories. However, examining the, driving forces leading to different post-agricultural abandonment trajectories is key to, understand how alternative uses of these lands can be developed to address the, environmental, economic, and social challenges faced in these areas. This paper, reviews the literature of the different trajectories observed after agricultural, abandonment and the related drivers and processes. Based on the literature evidence, we proposed a novel categorisation of different abandonment trajectories, with their, drivers and landscape outcomes. In most reported cases, lands transitioned towards, semi-natural landscapes and few returned to different agricultural uses after, abandonment. The most common driving force of the landscape trajectory was the, absence of land management where secondary succession processes led to seminatural, landscapes. Quality and state of these landscapes were variable. Alternative, trajectories were essentially driven by institutional and socio-economic drivers within, biophysical constraints and opportunities for (re-)afforestation, re-farming, and multifunctional, uses of the land after abandonment. While abandoned lands can bring, opportunities to respond to biodiversity and other environmental policy goals, the, evidence across case studies suggests that adequate resources with institutional and, socio-economic incentives are required to stimulate favourable development, mitigate, potential trade-offs, and support land management. © 2021 The Authors","Driving forces and Land abandonment and Land use change and Landscape change and Secondary succession and Europe and abandoned land and agricultural land and land use change and landscape change and rural area and secondary succession","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105833","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105833",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

There is little knowledge, however, of international tourists' attitudes towards forest management practises or of their effect during winter. This study investigated how commercial forests correspond to the environmental expectations of international nature-based tourists and how the season affects tourists' landscape preferences. Altogether 750 foreign visitors to Finnish Lapland responded to a survey and evaluated photographs presenting various types of forest landscapes in summer and winter. Beautiful scenery was the most important motive for the choice of travel destination and for participating in outdoor recreation. The results highlight the strong impact of seasons on the perceived quality of the landscape in commercial forests. Seasonal differences are largest in regeneration areas as snow cover mitigates the effects of forestry operations. Even-aged, middle-aged and mature forest stands were considered to be suitable for tourism in both summer and winter. There is a demand for adapted management regimes in commercial forests targeting year-round nature-based tourism. In conclusion, forestry and tourism can coexist in the same area with good planning and with management actions that take visual quality and recreational values of the environment into account.","Forest management and nature-based tourism and landscape research and landscape preferences and outdoor recreation and PUBLIC PREFERENCES and SCENIC BEAUTY and LANDSCAPE and ATTRIBUTES and AESTHETICS and RETENTION","10.1080/02827581.2016.1241892     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2016.1241892",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

A considerable primary literature exists on this topic, therefore it is important to assess whether this accumulated evidence can be used to reach general conclusions concerning vegetation vulnerability to inform conservation management decisions. Experimental trampling studies on a global scale were retrieved using a systematic review methodology and synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. The relationships between vegetation recovery and each of initial vegetation resistance, trampling intensity, time for recovery, Raunkiaer life-form (perennating bud position), and habitat were tested using random effects multiple meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The systematic search yielded 304 studies; of these, nine reported relevant randomized controlled experiments, providing 188 vegetation recovery effect sizes for analysis. The synthesis indicated there was significant heterogeneity in the impact of trampling on vegetation recovery. This was related to resistance and recovery time, and the interactions of these variables with Raunkiaer life-form, but was not strongly dependent on the intensity of the trampling experienced. The available evidence suggests that vegetation dominated by hemicryptophytes and geophytes recovers from trampling to a greater extent than vegetation dominated by other life-forms. Variation in effect within the chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte and geophyte life-form sub-groups was also explained by the initial resistance of vegetation to trampling, but not by trampling intensity. Intrinsic properties of plant communities appear to be the most important factors determining the response of vegetation to trampling disturbance. Specifically, the dominant Raunkiaer life-form of a plant community accounts for more variation in the resilience of communities to trampling than the intensity of the trampling experienced, suggesting that simple assessments based on this trait could guide decisions concerning sustainable access to natural areas. Methodological and reporting limitationsmust be overcome before more disparate types of evidence can be synthesised; this would enable more reliable extrapolation to non-study situations, and a more comprehensive understanding of how assessments of intrinsic plant traits can be used to underpin conservation management decisions concerning access.","Recreation and Relative vegetation cover and Evidence-based management and Plant functional traits and Resilience and Public access and Raunkiaer life-form and EVIDENCE-BASED CONSERVATION and PLANT-COMMUNITIES and RECREATION IMPACTS and NATIVE VEGETATION and BRITTANY FRANCE and DISTURBANCE and FOREST and MANAGEMENT and RESISTANCE and HEATHLAND","10.7717/peerj.360     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.360",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

The Functional Response (FR; resource use in relation to availability) is a classical ecological concept that has been increasingly applied to quantify, assess and compare ecological impacts of non-native species. Despite this recent growth, an overview of applications and knowledge gaps across relevant contexts is currently lacking. We conducted a systematic review using a combination of terms regarding FR and invasion science to synthesise scientific studies that apply the FR approach in the field and to suggest new areas where it could have valuable applications. Trends of publications using FR in invasion science and publications about FR in general were compared through the Activity Index. Data were extracted from papers to reveal temporal, bibliographic, and geographic trends, patterns in study attributes such as type of interaction and habitat investigated, taxonomic groups used, and context-dependencies assessed. In total, 120 papers were included in the review. We identified substantial unevenness in the reporting of FRs in invasion science, despite a rapidly growing number of studies. To date, research has been geographically skewed towards North America and Europe, as well as towards predator-prey interactions in freshwater habitats. Most studies have focused on a few species of invertebrates and fishes. Species origin, life stage, environmental temperature and habitat complexity were the most frequently considered context-dependencies. We conclude that while the FR approach has thus far been narrowly applied, it has broad potential application in invasion science and can be used to test major hypotheses in this research field. © Larissa Faria et al.

We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

Conservation conflicts are often complex and driven by variability and uncertainty in wildlife distribution and stakeholder wealth and power. To manage conflicts, empowering local stakeholders by decentralizing decisions and actions has been suggested to promote democratization and awareness of stakeholders. There is, however, a current gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment (e.g., farmers’ and managers’ practical, time or monetary resources) affects policy effectiveness. In this study, we apply an individual-based model of management strategy evaluation to simulate the conservation conflict surrounding protected and thriving common cranes (Grus grus) causing damage to agricultural production in Sweden and along the European flyways. We model the effect of farmer empowerment (i.e., increasing budgets to affect populations and agricultural production) in four management scenarios, in which we manipulate the availability and cost of two actions farmers may take in response to crane presence on their land: non-lethal (scaring) or lethal (culling) control. We find that lower budgets lead to increases in population size due to increased use of less costly scaring instead of shooting. Higher farmer budgets lead to increased population extinction risk. Intermediate budgets allow farmers to control the population size around the management target and limit impact on agricultural production to intermediate levels. Our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders, and particularly their power to implement effective actions, needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting management targets and strategies. Further, our results show that empowering individual farmers has the potential to contribute to conflict management and to balance agricultural with conservation objectives, but increased stakeholder involvement also requires careful planning and monitoring. © 2020 The Author(s)","Conservation conflict and Grus grus and Human decision making and Individual-based model and Management strategy evaluation and Multi-objective management and Sweden and Gruidae and Agricultural robots and Animals and Budget control and Conservation and Cranes and Economics and Land use and Population statistics and Agricultural productions and Conflict management and Individual based model and Management scenarios and Management strategy evaluations and Planning and monitoring and Stakeholder involvement and Wildlife conservation and action plan and agricultural production and bird and conflict management and conservation management and decentralization and decision analysis and empowerment and individual-based model and land use change and policy making and population size and stakeholder and wildlife management and Agriculture","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109396","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109396",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Policy reform, market trends and changes to the way citizens and consumers think about the countryside all suggest a need for thinking strategically about the future development of these areas. However, without a broad involvement of stakeholders, land use conflicts, and social and cultural conflicts in general, may increase. Involving stakeholders in upland areas can be facilitated by using scenario technique and by discussing alternative futures in local stakeholder panels. In this paper we present four scenarios of land-use change for the year 2030, and their assessments by stakeholder panels in Scotland, France, Norway, Switzerland, Slovakia and Greece. The aim of the paper is to explore the ways in which stakeholders in these locations advocate and assess these scenarios. We also explore how stakeholders in different countries weight the visual landscape impacts, the livelihood and biodiversity aspects of the scenarios in their assessment, and the reasons for their prioritising. The cross-country analysis shows that stakeholders across the study areas are united in their overall rejection of agricultural liberalisation, advocating a production-oriented, but multifunctional and environmentally-friendly agriculture that maintains landscapes and biodiversity.

Numerous studies have assessed the relationships between attributes of urban green spaces (size, vegetation, isolation, urbanization) and bird species richness, but little is known about how these factors influence community composition. I censused breeding land birds in 93 urban green spaces in Oslo, Norway, and species were grouped according to ecology (habitat preference, nest site, migration, diet, and red-list status). I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city.","Urban biodiversity and Urban greenspace and Area effect and Habitat effect and Isolation effect and SPECIES RICHNESS and AVIAN COMMUNITY and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE and DIVERSITY and GRADIENT and AVIFAUNA and PARKS and CITY and DETERMINANTS","10.1007/s11252-017-0706-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-017-0706-x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Particularly increasing urbanisation may affect species turnover and functional composition of biological communities. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of land-cover change in a medium-sized urban municipality from 2011 to 2018, and the effects of urbanisation on avian species- and functional diversity. The study was performed in Trondheim (Norway), using local land-cover maps and GBIF bird species occurrence records. GLMMs were used to model species turnover as a function of urbanisation, and the probability of species appearance and disappearance based on urbanisation and species traits. The extent of bird species turnover within a municipality-wide 500 × 500m2 grid was not predicted by a changes in developed area, but the probability of disappearance and appearance of bird species varied with urbanisation and bird functional traits. Species associated with urban- or open areas showed a decreasing probability of disappearing and an increasing probability of appearing with increasing amount of developed area within grid cells. Similarly, granivorous species showed a decreasing probability of disappearing. Species feeding above ground-level showed positive responses to changes in land-cover. The probability of both appearance and disappearance, thus species turnover, increased with increasing longevity. Most functional groups respond negatively to increasing urbanisation, indicating a potential impoverishment of local avifauna with future land-cover modifications. Considering planned future land-cover changes within the municipality, the local avian communities are in danger of homogenisation. The recommendations for local management are to minimise conversion of vulnerable habitats, such as wetlands and woodlands, in particular if these are converted to developed area. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bird diversity and Functional groups and Land-cover change and Urbanisation","10.1007/s11252-022-01258-z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-022-01258-z",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, before selecting the appropriate geographic origin of seeds, it is vital to explore taxonomic complexity related to the focal taxa. We used ddRAD-seq to screen genomic diversity within Carex bigelowii s.lat. focussing on Norway. This species complex is considered a candidate for seeding, but presents considerable morphological, ecological, and genetic variation. The genetic structure of 132 individuals of C. bigelowii s.lat., including Carex nigra as an outgroup, was explored using ordinations, clustering analyses, and a genetic barrier algorithm. Two highly divergent clusters were evident, supporting the recognition of two taxonomic units “C. dacica” and C. bigelowii “subsp. bigelowii”. Previously defined seed-sourcing regions for C. bigelowii s.lat. did not consider the known taxonomic complexity, and therefore interpreted the overall genetic structure as seed-sourcing regions, not taxa. We estimated genetic neighborhood sizes within each taxon to be 100–150 km and 300 km, respectively, indicating species-specific delimitations of local seed-sourcing regions. Frequent hybrids, local genetic distinctiveness, and suggested ecotypes add complexity to the discussed seed-sourcing regions. Our results show how genomic screening of diversity and structure in a species complex can alleviate the taxonomic impediment, inform practical questions, and legal requirements related to seed-sourcing, and together with traditional taxonomic work provide necessary information for a sound management of biodiversity. © 2021 The Authors.

In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data.

We study mixed-species stands consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), birch (Betula pendula Roth.), and other broadleaves (e.g., oak [Quercus sp.], maple [Acer sp.]). The analysis is based on an economic description of continuous cover forest management using an empirically estimated size-structured transition matrix model. We use size-specific decomposition rates for dead wood, with the lower limit on total dead wood volume varying between 0 and 40 m3 ha-1. The optimization problem is solved in its general dynamic form using gradient-based interior point methods. Increasing the dead wood volume requirement affects total stand density only slightly, but increases stand heterogeneity as other broadleaves are grown in higher numbers. In addition, increasing the dead wood requirement has only a minor effect on the total felled volume, but harvests shift from timber harvests to biodiversity fellings to maintain the required dead wood volume. In the optimal steady state with a high dead wood requirement, two harvesting cohorts emerge: one for timber harvests and the other for biodiversity fellings. Increasing the dead wood requirement decreases steady-state net timber income by up to 30 percent compared to the unconstrained solution. © 2019 Society of American Foresters.","Biodiversity and Coarse woody debris and Economic optimization and Mixed-species stands and Stand management and Uneven-Aged forestry and Coverings and Dead Wood and Forestry and Harvesting and Norway and Optimization and Volume and Plants (botany) and Timber and Biodiversity indicators and Continuous cover forestries and Interior-point method and Norway spruce (Picea abies [l.] Karst.) and Optimal steady state and Optimization problems and Transition matrices","10.1093/forsci/fxz073","https://doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxz073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The forested landscapes occupied either by Scots pine or Norway spruce were managed by using seven management scenarios. The current thinning recommendations were considered as a baseline and alternative scenarios included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking than in the baseline. The previous ones were also managed by using N fertilization, and an unthinned scenario (with final felling) was used as a comparison. A life cycle assessment tool with inputs from a forest ecosystem model was used to calculate full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use in substituting fossil-fuel-intensive materials and fossil fuels. The results showed that increased stocking and N fertilization were generally the most optimal forest management scenarios for full climate impacts and economic profitability in both species. Increased carbon sequestration through forest management surpassed the decreased economic profitability, and no single management scenario maximized both climate impact and economic profitability. The lowest climate impact, but the highest economic profitability, was found for the initially mature age structure. The calculated average displacement factors for the harvested wood products served as valid indicators for climate impacts but could not thoroughly depict the absolute climate impacts. More research is needed to improve the dynamic connection between forest ecosystem carbon balances and the substitution effects of harvested wood products. © 2021","Climate impact and Displacement factor and Economic profitability and Forest management and Harvested wood products and Optimality and Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris and Artificial life and Biomass and Carbon and Climate models and Economic and social effects and Ecosystems and Fossil fuels and Life cycle and Nitrogen fertilizers and Profitability and Wood products and Carbon sequestration and Forested landscapes and Life cycle assessment tools and Management scenarios and Optimal forest managements and Substitution effect and age structure and biomass and climate change and climate effect and coniferous tree and fertilizer application and forest management and forest product and fossil fuel and management practice and optimization and profitability and Forestry","10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.106027","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.106027",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Flows of supplied ecosystem services depend on a broad range of factors, including climate, hydrology, land management and human population density. The aims of this study were: 1) to quantify the total economic value (TEV) of consumed ecosystem services across Nordic catchments, 2) to explain variation in ecosystem service value using socio-geographic and natural factors as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression, and 3) to determine which societal groups benefit from these ecosystem services. Furthermore, we tested the scientific rigour of our framework based on the concept of final ecosystem services (FES). We used a spatially explicit, integrative framework for ecosystem services quantification to compile data on final ecosystem services provision from six catchments across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Our estimates showed a broad variation in TEV and in the proportion contributed by separate services, with the highest TEV of €7,199 ± 4,561 ha-1 y-1 (mean ± standard deviation) in the Norwegian Orrevassdraget catchment, and the lowest TEV of €183 ± 517 ha-1 y-1 in the Finnish Simojoki catchment. The value of material services was dependent on both geographic factors and land management practices, while the value of immaterial services was strongly dependent on population density and the availability of water. Using spatial data on land use, forest productivity and population density in a GIS analysis showed where hotspots of ecosystem services supply are located, and where specific stakeholder groups benefit most. We show that our framework is applicable to a broad variety of data sources and across countries, making international comparative analyses possible. © 2021 Immerzeel et al.

Throughout its 50-years history, marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon has been associated with escapes, and studies have shown that escapees may enter rivers, spawn successfully, and this may lead to farmed-to-wild genetic introgression and maladaptation in wild populations. Yet, an open question is what factors can best explain the variability in the proportion of farmed escapees in wild populations, and when present, which additional factors lead to introgression. Here, we combine two large-scale data sets from monitoring escaped farmed salmon and introgression in Norwegian rivers between 2006 and 2018 to model how anthropogenic, environmental, and population factors influence proportion of escapees and level of introgression. We found that increasing farming intensity and river discharge increase the expected proportions of escaped farmed salmon in rivers, whereas a larger wild salmon population size reduces the expected proportion of escapees despite increasing the expected absolute numbers of escaped farmed salmon. On a large scale, introgression is primarily a function of proportions of escaped farmed salmon, and only to a minor extent a function of local environmental factors or salmon population characteristics. This suggests that as long as salmon aquaculture is based on technologies where non-sterile fish can escape, all anadromous wild Atlantic salmon populations are at risk. Large marine protected areas without salmon aquaculture may slow down the rate of intrusion and introgression by increasing the distance between intensive aquaculture and wild populations. © 2022 The Author(s).

In the present case of state-owned commercial forests in Finland, legislation requires specific management practices to enhance recreational benefits free of charge to the public. This choice experiment considers Finnish people's valuation of the recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests to evaluate whether the recreational benefits produced justify the related loss of profits from timber sales. We focus on three management attributes: scenic buffer zones along lakes and rivers, habitats for game birds, and the quality of scenery as reflected by the frequency of clear-cut areas along hiking trails. Marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) effects for the attributes are estimated with random parameters logit models specified in the WTP space, while preference-space models are used to estimate in physical terms the attribute levels that maximize the benefits to the public. Despite regional differences in preferences, people in all parts of Finland valued the current recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests considerably. Nationwide, the aggregate benefits of recreation-enhancing management clearly exceeded the estimated opportunity costs. The most preferred levels of management attributes were slightly above the current levels, suggesting an increase in the provision of recreational services when not considering the associated costs.

However, traits of bryophytes and lichens, important components of many ecosystems, have received less attention than those of vascular plants. We explored the use of functional traits of multiple important organism groups in recovery assessment. We combined data on traits and species composition for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens from four alpine spoil heaps and their undisturbed surroundings in western Norway, collected at three time-points spanning more than two decades. We studied changes in community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values and distribution of trait-category optima over time. We analyzed temporal variation in joint functional trait composition using the ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) to predict time to recovery. We observed functional shifts along the successional gradient for all organism groups, e.g. from wind-dispersed propagules shortly after disturbance to vegetative reproduction at later successional stages. Over time, the similarity between dispersal-related traits of vascular plants and bryophytes on the spoil heaps and in their surroundings increased, indicating that propagule influx is important in alpine restoration. The joint functional trait composition of all spoil heaps converged towards that of their surroundings: one spoil heap had recovered 34 years after construction, while the predicted time to recovery for the other three was 59–74 years. Our results indicate that inclusion of multiple organism groups improves trait-based recovery assessments and time-to-recovery predictions. Further development of trait databases is essential for future use of joint functional trait composition in recovery assessment. © 2020 The Authors.

Taking local knowledge into account allows the valuation of ES experienced by stakeholders. It is the case for reindeer herders in Scandinavia, the ungulate being a keystone specie for subarctic socio-ecosystems. We adapt the ecosystem services assessment (ESA) proposed in Finland to the case study of the Gabna herders' community (Sweden), considering its cultural, geographical, and dynamic specificities. We used Saami ecological categories over the land-use categories of the CORINE Land Cover (CLC). We reassessed ES at the scale of the Gabna community and its seasonal pastures. We studied their evolution over 2000-2018, using CLC maps and Change CLC maps. Integration of Saami ecological categories in the classification of land cover did not substantially change the land cover distributions. However, ES were greater in Saami land use compared to other CLC categories. Cultural services were higher for summer and interseasonal pastures, dedicated to the reindeer reproduction, suggesting interactions between provisioning and cultural ES. Land cover changes are mostly represented by intensive forestry (5% of winter pastures) impeding reindeer grazing activity, while other seasonal pasture landscape composition stayed comparable along time. Consequently, forest activity, and in a lesser extent glacier melting and urbanization are the main drivers of the temporal evolution of ES. In the frame of pastoral landscapes conservation, the use of local terminologies opens perspectives for a holistic approach in environmental science. It raises the importance of local stakeholders as co-researchers in nature conservation studies.","reindeer herding and indigenous knowledge and ecosystem services and land cover changes and Swedish Lapland and TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE and CLIMATE-CHANGE and CONSERVATION and REINDEER and SCIENCE and SAMI","10.3390/su12010390     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/su12010390",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Ruka-Kuusamo in northeastern Finland serves as a case region for the ex ante evaluation. A novel evaluation framework of the study focuses on technical feasibility, institutional context, and potential surplus of LRVT to ecosystem service provision and social capital. The evaluation data from four years action research comprise surveys and group interviews with ecosystem service providers (forest owners) and buyers (tourism entrepreneurs and tourists), complemented with newspaper articles, forest data, and meeting minutes of local authorities. The results show tension between general acceptance and practical readiness to start LRVT. Several institutional challenges need to be solved before adopting LRVT in the region. Ambiguous understanding on the impacts of forest management to landscape and recreation value, deeply institutionalised norms among the forestry community, and hidden agendas may make it difficult to achieve considerable and sustainable improvements in the quality of ecosystem services. This paper concludes with discussing elements of LRVT that may be functional and provide positive returns to recreation values of the area and to social capital inside the community. Several years of research intervention and public discussion have now resettled the network of local actors to a promising position that shows capacity to co-create functional local forest governance, including possibly a publicly or privately organised LRVT system.

This study provides observations on approaches for assessing circular economy and illustrates, with a Finnish case study, the potential of circular economy to mitigate pressures on biodiversity. The case study focuses on the construction and real estate sectors, as well as the forest industry. The findings imply that circular economy actions that reduce the extraction of virgin raw materials and relieve land use pressures are effective. Improving material efficiency, increasing the cascading use of wood, and optimizing the use and reuse of materials and products, as well as extending the lifetime of buildings and optimizing space use, have good potential for mitigating pressures on biodiversity in Finland. However, as forest utilization has a major impact on Finnish biodiversity, certain actions that possibly increase the use of forest resources (e.g., replacing fossil-based, concrete, or steel materials with wood-based solutions) may impair biodiversity if biodiversity-enhancing forest management practices are not utilized. Assessing the biodiversity impacts of circular economy is challenging, and the need for further research and the development of indicators and assessment methods is clear. © 2022 The Author(s)","Biodiversity and Circular economy and Environment and Finland and Impact assessment and Land use and Material efficiency and biodiversity and environmental impact assessment and forest management and land use and material form and mitigation","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102625","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102625",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

This dead wood is most prevalent in old-growth forest, yet intensive management means that little old growth is left, and the remaining forests rarely attain the necessary age and structure to resemble these original forests. There is increasing recognition, however, that forests that have not been subjected to modern, stand-replacing harvest methods (like clear-cutting), and in which management activities are no longer occurring, may be able to provide habitat similar to old-growth forest for many species (older mean age, higher deadwood volumes, and more age-class heterogeneity). These are called ‘near-natural’ forests. We use linear mixed models and redundancy analysis (RDA) to compare beetle species richness and community composition using a large, mixed data set, containing more than one third of all beetle species known from Norway, from window trap records in three types of forest: intensively managed mature stands, recent clear-cuts, and ‘near-natural forests’. Even though location, study substrate and other sampling details vary substantially between sites, the signal from management still comes out as a significant factor explaining the patterns on beetle diversity. We find that species richness of saproxylic, natural-forest indicator, and red-listed beetle species is higher in both near-natural forests and recent clear-cuts than in managed mature forests. Community composition also differs significantly between the three forest types, and these differences are correlated with forest age and volume at the landscape (1 km radius) level. These findings provide support for the idea that near-natural forests provide habitats that are distinct from those in managed forests and which are important for species of conservation concern. Clear-cuts briefly harbor some of these same species, probably due to the sun-exposed coarse woody debris (CWD) that is available immediately after felling, but this effect is transient. Conservation of existing near-natural forests, many of which are currently without legal protection, should therefore be prioritized. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity and Clear-cuts and Coleoptera and CWD and Forest management and Indicator species and Landscape scale and Near-natural forests and Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Saproxylic and Window traps and Conservation and Dead Wood and Ecosystems and Forestry and Forests and Growth and Management and Norway and Living systems studies and Redundancy and Clear cuts and Natural forests and beetle and biodiversity and bioindicator and clearcutting and coarse woody debris and community composition and conservation status and dead wood and forest ecosystem and forest management and growth and old-growth forest and species richness and Trees","10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118124","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118124",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

However, such shifts can be limited by a variety of non-climatic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil conditions, landscape fragmentation and some species-specific traits. Many changes in species distributions have been observed, although no evidence of complete community replacement has been registered yet. Climatic signals are often confounded with the effects of human activity, for example, forest encroachment at the treeline owing to the coupled effect of climate change and highland pasture abandonment. Data on the treeline ecotone, barriers to the expected treeline or dominant tree species shifts due to climate and land use change, and their possible impacts on biodiversity in 11 mountain areas of interest, from Italy to Norway and from Spain to Bulgaria, are reported. We investigated the role of environmental conditions on treeline ecotone features with a focus on treeline shift. The results showed that treeline altitude and the altitudinal width of the treeline ecotone, as well as the significance of climatic and soil parameters as barriers against tree species shift, significantly decreased with increasing latitude. However, the largest part of the commonly observed variability in mountain vegetation near the treeline in Europe seems to be caused by geomorphological, geological, pedological and microclimatic variability in combination with different land use history and present socio-economic relations.","Vegetation zone shift and Climate change and Climate models and Treeline ecotone and European mountains and Ecosystem services and FAGUS-SYLVATICA L. and LAND-USE CHANGE and CLIMATE-CHANGE and GLOBAL-CHANGE and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and RANGE SHIFTS and ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE and FOREST STRUCTURE and SWEDISH SCANDES and SWISS ALPS","10.3354/cr01465     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.3354/cr01465",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

Improvements require changes in farming practices, but empirical evidence on farmers’ motivations underlying their on-farm biodiversity management remains fragmented. To date, there is no aggregated overview of behavioural determinants that influence European farmers’ decisions to implement biodiversity-friendly farming practices. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 150 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022. We identified 108 potential determinants of farmers’ behaviour, which were integrated into a multilevel framework. The results show that the farmers’ decisions are complex and often non-directional processes, shaped by numerous external (at a society, landscape, community, and farm level) and internal factors. These factors are embedded in regional and cultural contexts. However, the analysis of study sites indicates that the spatial coverage of scientific evidence on biodiversity-friendly farming measures is uneven across Europe. Given the diversity of local and socio-cultural conditions, there is a need for public policies, including the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, to address more specifically determinants encouraging biodiversity-friendly farm management. This entails reflecting culture-specific perspectives and incorporating experiential knowledge into multilevel policy design processes, as well as offering regionally adapted advice on measure implementation and biodiversity impacts. © 2023, The Author(s).","Agri-environment-climate measures (AECM) and Biodiversity management and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Environmental perception and Sustainable farming and Systematic literature review","10.1007/s10460-023-10505-8","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10505-8",NA,NA,NA,"Farmland","Summarised evidence"

Fire management has been controlled by foresters since the late-19th century, and Sami herders have had to deal with the effects of both fire suppression and prescribed burning. However, the environmental history of fire management and reindeer herding in Sweden has never been thoroughly investigated. We therefore analyzed written archives in order to understand how reindeer herding was considered in planned burning during the mid-20th century, and how the effects of prescribed burning on reindeer herding were interpreted by foresters. We supplemented the interpretation of written sources by including local Sami reindeer herders' insights about prescribed burning. Written records show that reindeer herding was increasingly integrated into the planning process during the 20th century, yet foresters failed to include important aspects of reindeer herding in their interpretation of the effects of prescribed burning. The Sami consider the effects of burning in terms of fodder availability, opportunities for reindeer to graze the fodder, and any impact on the reindeer's movement patterns and thus herd management. The Sami's historical perspective is essential in order to reconstruct a comprehensive picture of the past, and adapt forestry measures effectively in the future.","Forest history and Fire management and Northern Sweden and Prescribed burning and Sami reindeer herding and NORTHERN and HUSBANDRY and HISTORY and SWEDEN and AREA and BIODIVERSITY and RESTORATION and PASTURES and DECLINE","10.1007/s00267-021-01503-9","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01503-9",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Optimizing management for multiple objectives over larger land areas likely entails trading off the practicability of the process against the goodness of the solution. It is therefore worthwhile to resolve how large areas are required as management planning regions to reconcile conflicting objectives as effectively as possible. We aimed to reveal how the extent of forestry planning regions impacts the potential to mitigate a forestry-conservation conflict in Finland, represented as a trade-off between harvest income and deadwood availability. We used forecasted data from a forest simulator, a hierarchy of forestry planning regions, and an optimization model to explore the production possibility frontier between harvest income and deadwood. We compared the overall outcomes when management was optimized within the different-sized planning regions in terms of the two objectives, the spatial variation of deadwood, and the optimal combinations of management regimes. Increasing the size of the planning regions did produce higher simultaneous levels of the two objectives, but the differences were most often of the magnitude of only a few percentages. The differences among the scales were minor also in terms of the spatial variation in deadwood availability and in the optimal management combinations. The conflict between timber harvesting and deadwood availability is only marginally easier to mitigate at large spatial scales than at small forest ownership scales. However, regardless of the spatial scale of planning, the achievable solutions may not be good enough to safeguard deadwood- dependent biodiversity without active deadwood creation.","DEAD-WOOD and BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION and FINLAND and MULTIFUNCTIONALITY and FRAGMENTATION and ASSOCIATIONS and DIVERSITY and DYNAMICS and ECOLOGY and STANDS","10.1371/journal.pone.0218213     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218213",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

A possible solution is to reduce the effects through forest management practices, for example leaving forest stands uncut as landscape shields to hide the turbines and stop them from spoiling the scenery. Using data from an online survey of landowners, we investigated whether voluntary mechanisms could encourage forest owners to change their forest management practices near wind farms to minimize the harmful effects. More precisely, we analyzed forest owners' willingness to participate in an initiative involving payment for ecosystem services called Landscape Value Trade (LVT) and studied the related compensation claims in southwestern Finland. We explained willingness to participate and the claims made with the characteristics of the landowners or their holding and with attitudinal variables. According to our results, 73.6% of the respondents would possibly or certainly participate in the mechanism. The average annual compensation requirement in this study was €298 per hectare. In addition, we found that low dependence on forestry and forest-related income tended to increase interest in participation in the LVT initiative and reduce the compensation claims. An important result related to the cost-effective application of the mechanism, is that the more interested the respondents were in cooperation with the LVT initiative the less compensation they would claim. Thus, the voluntary nature of the LVT initiative simultaneously acted as a cost-reducing element. The results could help in detecting some of the key features of the supply side of LVT initiatives. © 2020 The Author(s)","Forest landscapes and Harmful effects of wind turbines and Landscape value trade and Payments for ecosystem services and Private forest owners and Willingness to accept compensation and Commerce and Compensation and Cost Effectiveness and Ecosystems and Forest Management and Forestry and Interest and Wind and Cost effectiveness and Wind power and Cost effective and Ecosystem services and Electrical energy and Forest management practices and Harmful effects and Landscape values and Online surveys and South-western finland and Finland","10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102382","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102382",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

This study presents four different record-breaking disasters during 1992–2014 in Sweden, where the idea of setting up reserves has been advanced in the aftermath, but with slightly different results in relation to attitudes about nature conservation and modes of remembering. The phenomenon is primarily discussed against theory formation around disaster memorials and window of opportunity for change. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a comparative case study approach. The cases are described through narratives on the basis of “grey” literature, i.e. documents from Swedish authorities in the form of evaluations, summaries from experience seminars, political decisions on the establishment of nature conservation or information material addressed to the public, and also media reporting. Findings: The nature reserves will be reminiscent of the disasters since the natural regrowth will take decades but may also be accompanied by exhibitions in visitor centers, arts and plays, monuments and bureaucratic documents, all of which contribute to the memory. In all but one case, such artifacts are secondary in relation to the explicit goal of forest conservation. The local population's attitude to the reserve formation plays a big role for the plans to be implemented.

Analysis is based on frame analysis (i.e. how an object is defined and positioned) and ideas drawn from a political ecology approach. Two main frames can be identified within the Finnish legal and policy framework: peat as a natural resource to be utilised for national energy sufficiency and economic competitiveness, and peat as a valuable source of biodiversity and an integral element of global ecosecurity. Analysis reveals the degree to which the definition of issues or objects in legal and policy terms is important in determining outcomes. It also reveals that national policies have swung back and forth and are prone to economic power struggles. Furthermore, while laws and regulations have offered strong and longstanding support for the extractive use of peat, the latest regulatory developments show a break from this trend.

Yet little is known about the mechanisms by which PAs are colonized by NNS, and more specifically the role of colonizing events from surrounding areas. Here, we compared terrestrial and freshwater non-native plants and animals recorded in Norwegian PAs and in 5-km belts around them, using the database of the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre Species Map Service. Our analysis included 1,602 NNS and 671 PAs. We found that NNS were recorded in only 23% of the PAs, despite the fact that 90% of the 5-km belts were colonized by at least one NNS. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed that the number of NNS in the 5-km belts was a strong explanatory variable of the NNS richness inside PAs. Other significant variables included the surface area of the PA, mean human population density in the PA, main type of habitat and accessibility of PAs. We also observed similarity in the species in and around the PAs, with, on average, two thirds of the NNS present in a specific PA also present in its 5-km belt. Furthermore, NNS were recorded in PAs on average 4.5 years after being recorded in the 0–5 km belts, suggesting a dynamic of rapid colonization from the belts to the PAs. Invasive NNS represented 12% of NNS in the belts but 40% in the PAs. This difference was related to the higher abundance of invasive NNS in the belts. Our results highlight the necessity of expanding the focus of NNS management in PAs beyond their boundaries, in particular to prevent incursions of NNS with high negative ecological impact. © Copyright © 2021 Holenstein, Simonson, Smith, Blackburn and Charpentier.","alien species and invasive species and non-native species and protected area boundaries and protected areas and species distribution","10.3389/fevo.2020.625137","https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.625137",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Multiple","Observational studies"

Do the results depend on autocorrelation in geographical space and species ordination space? Species richness is expected to increase as a function of the size of an island; are the responses to island size different between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands. Does the land-use history have an impact on the current species composition and richness pattern? LocationThe archipelago is in the oceanic section of the Atlantic bioclimatic zone, west Norway. This archipelago was part of the ancient and widespread treeless heathland found along the European west coast. MethodsData on vascular plants were compiled from the forested islands, and their differences in species composition were analysed by ordination. The hypotheses were tested by means of t-tests and generalized linear models, the spatial component was accounted for by means of Moran's I and spatial autoregression with the moving average approach. This was done both in geographical space and species ordination space. ResultsThere are more vascular plants on the islands with introduced P.mugo than on the islands with native P.sylvestris. The latter have rather homogenous undergrowth dominated by bryophytes. This may explain lower richness on islands with native forest and why island size is not correlated with species richness on these islands. In contrast, P.mugo is easily wind-felled in autumn storms, which keeps rocky microhabitats exposed to air and new forest habitats are created. Species that are associated with the previous land-use system (grazing) prevail on islands with introduced pine, and thus contribute to higher plant richness. ConclusionsThe difference in species richness and island species-area relationship (ISAR) between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands may relate to the same underpinning causes. Species from the old land-use system have survived on P.mugo islands, but not in the late-successional forest with a more closed canopy that has developed on P.sylvestris islands. Thus habitat and species richness is higher and increases with area on P.mugo islands but not on P.sylvestris islands.","Autocorrelation and Diversity and Introduced species and Island biogeography and Pine and Richness and Spatial Autoregression and Species space and SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION and WESTERN NORWAY and GEOGRAPHICAL ECOLOGY and BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS and PLANT INVASIONS and RED HERRINGS and FRAMEWORK and FOREST and GLOBALIZATION and BIODIVERSITY","10.1111/jvs.12045     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12045",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal","Observational studies"

One of the aims was to reduce conflicts between geese and agriculture to an acceptable level. Since 2006, Norway has offered subsidies to farmers that provide refuge areas for geese on their land. We evaluate the mid-Norwegian goose management subsidy scheme, with a view to its adjustment to prevailing ecological and socio-economic parameters. The analysis indicates that the legitimacy of the scheme is highly dependent on transparency of knowledge management and accountability of management scheme to the farming community. Among farmers, as well as front-line officials, outcomes of prioritisation processes within the scheme are judged unfair when there is an evident mismatch between payments and genuine damage.

We apply systems thinking methods to a series of LR case studies to analyse the causal structures underlying LR governance and management in Sweden. We show that these structures appear to comprise of an interlinked system of at least three sets of drivers and four core processes. This system exhibits many characteristics of a transformative change towards an integrated, adaptive approach to governance and management. Key challenges for Swedish LR projects relate to institutional and regulatory flexibility, the timely availability of sufficient funds, and the management of learning and knowledge production processes.

Many studies have examined the impact of climate change on ecosystem carbon storage, but few have investigated the impact of land-use change and herbivory. However, land-use change is a major aspect of environmental change, and livestock grazing is the most extensive land use globally. In this study, we combine a grazing exclosure experiment and a natural experiment to test the impact of grazer exclusion on vegetation dynamics and ecosystem carbon stores in the short term (12-year exclosures), and the long term (islands inaccessible to livestock), in a heavily grazed mountain region in Norway. Following long-term absence of sheep, birch forest was present. The grazing-resistant grass Nardus stricta, dominated under long-term grazing, whilst the selected grass Deschampsia flexuosa and herb species dominated the vegetation layer in the long-term absence of sheep. The established birch forest led to vegetation carbon stocks being higher on the islands (0.56 kg C m(-2) on the islands compared to 0.18 kg C m(-2) where grazed) and no difference in soil carbon stocks. In the short-term exclusion of sheep, there were minor differences in carbon stocks reflecting the longer term changes. These results show that aboveground carbon stocks are higher in the long-term absence of sheep than in the continual presence of high sheep densities, associated with a vegetation state change between tundra and forest. The reduction of herbivore populations can facilitate forest establishment and increase aboveground carbon stocks, however, the sequestration rate is low.","biomass and tundra and herbivory and land-use and livestock and treeline and MOUNTAIN BIRCH FOREST and LAND-USE CHANGES and TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS and LARGE HERBIVORES and CYCLE FEEDBACKS and SOIL CARBON and CLIMATE and VEGETATION and STORAGE and RESPONSES and Trees","10.1007/s10021-014-9784-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9784-2",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

There are clear links between agricultural change and declines in biodiversity across a wide range of agricultural systems, and convincing evidence that reversing these changes leads to a recovery in wildlife populations. 2 Nearly 4 billion euros are now paid annually through agri-environment schemes (AES) to farmers in Europe and North America to make environmental improvements to their land. Where appropriately designed and targeted, these schemes have proved successful in reversing declines in farmland wildlife populations. 3 We argue that insights gained from island biogeography and metapopulation theory, and from theoretical and empirical assessments of landscape connectivity suggest that AES may carry substantial wider benefits, which so far have not been considered in the design and deployment of such schemes. ‘Softening’ agricultural land could offset some of the negative impacts on biodiversity of the loss and fragmentation of non-agricultural habitats; could allow species to adapt to climate change; could slow the spread of alien and invasive species; and could contribute positively to the coherence of key biodiversity and protected area networks. Indeed, AES might represent the only viable way to counter these threats. 4 We outline a number of ways in which these wider benefits could be taken account of in the design of AES and suggest a number of characteristics of the species most likely to benefit from them. 5 Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes might bring significant environmental benefits to habitats other than farmland by restoring the agricultural matrix that separates them. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that matrix restoration improves a number of ecosystem functions. Where they are available, AES might therefore represent a viable mechanism for addressing a range of pandemic environmental problems such as global climate change. Little consideration has so far been given to these wider conservation applications in the design, deployment and monitoring of AES.","Ecosystem","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01146.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01146.x",NA,NA,"Not relevant",NA,NA

Evidence from norway, germany and new zealand","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","Background: Solo—being intentionally solitary in nature—is receiving growing attention as a valuable outdoor education program component. Its practice and history have been researched in the context of experiential learning, but few studies have explicitly examined how solo experiences can affect dimensions of well-being. This study investigated a broad range of well-being pathways provided by being solo, based on data from Norway, Germany, and New Zealand. Methods: Using qualitative content analysis (QCA), the solo debrief responses of 40 participants (26 females, age: 19–64 years) were analysed, applying the PERMA-V framework (emotions, engagement, relationship, meaning, achievement, and vitality). Variations in the reports were explored as a function of the national sample, gender, age, prior solo experiences and expectations. Results: The study suggests that hedonic and eudemonic well-being pathways, represented by the six PERMA-V pillars, interrelate strongly. The experience of a range of positive emotions and connecting process during solo highlights two of the most frequent findings related to well-being pathways. The secondary findings suggest minor variations in the well-being pathways for the different national samples, gender and age. Expectations and prior experiences with solo were identified as context factors with minor impact. Further, the data-driven analysis identified specific physical activities, landscape features, sense-activation, perception of time and ‘good’ weather as relevant to the specific experience. Conclusions: Solo experiences provide for well-being-related pathways in a multitude of ways, which highlights the well-being potential of solo implementation across practical fields beyond outdoor education, such as wilderness therapy, and environmental and planetary health initiatives.

Forest expansion is also a major trend in Norway, with an annual increase of about 24.6 million m(3) during 2007-11. Similar trends were found in the study area at Mt FlOyen, Bergen, western Norway. Two types of forest expansion were discovered: expansion of alien coniferous tree species from plantations and spontaneous expansion of native Betula pubescens. Historical data on livestock grazing and climate were used to detect possible drivers of forestation. Forest expansion started in the 1970s, in a period when average July temperatures were lower than the period before. This is an indication that forest expansion was triggered by another cause than increasing summer temperatures. The area used to be heathland for livestock pasture but grazing came to an end around 1900. The area is well below the upper alpine forest limit and forestation should be expected when grazing ceased. The reason why forestation started so late is that neighbouring areas were also deforested. Forestation took place when trees planted in the 1950s began to produce seeds from the 1970s. During the twentieth century birch colonized steep slopes and still continues to do so in abandoned pastures. A distinct increase in July temperatures was found since 2000, which may increase the speed of future forest expansion. This will cause a substantial increase in uptake and storage of carbon, and will decrease the need for afforestation of new open land as suggested by some governmental bodies.","forestation drivers and climate change and land-use change and COASTAL HEATHLANDS and DRIVING FORCES and VEGETATION and DYNAMICS and TREELINE and ALPS and TIME","10.1111/geoa.12056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/geoa.12056",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Norwegian and international tourists and some locals were equipped with single-use cameras, a log and a questionnaire with the instruction to take pictures of attractive and non-attractive elements in the constructed landscape. Despite the intention of the study to emphasize the built landscape, the selection of motives shows that tourists - especially the international ones - are more strongly occupied with the natural landscape and its attractive elements than, for instance, the outlook of buildings. The respondents value destination development where the natural, cultural and built landscape form a unity which reflect the perceived images of traditional rural environments and everyday life. On the other hand, Norwegians - and locals particularly - are more conscious about local building traditions, especially the non-attractive elements in that respect. Our findings demonstrate that VEP and public participation are useful tools in destination development and branding, and that a holistic design and approach might create competitive advantages for rural destinations trying to position themselves in the overall market place.","visitor-employed photography and rural landscape and community development and Norway and tourist destination image and EMPLOYED PHOTOGRAPHY and ENGLISH LANDSCAPE and TOURISM and PREFERENCES and PERCEPTION and IMAGE","10.1080/15022250.2015.1014129     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)","https://doi.org/10.1080/15022250.2015.1014129",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of P application and P balance on stream P concentrations in different production systems of Norwegian agriculture. The average application of P in the studied catchments ranged from 21 to 53 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), including the P application in both mineral fertiliser and manure for the monitoring periods (16-20 years). The highest P application was found in a catchment with high livestock density, and potato and vegetable production. This catchment also showed the highest P balance (applied P minus P removed with yields) of 26 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) on average, and also a very high soil P status (P-AL). The P balance for all other catchments ranged from 3 to 13 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). For all catchments, the average application of mineral P fertiliser decreased during the monitoring period, especially during the last 2-3 years. However, total P application increased in three catchments due to increased livestock density and manure P application. Average concentrations of total P in the streams varied from 65 to 392 mu g L-1. The highest concentration was measured in the stream from the catchment with highest P balance and soil P status. The concentrations of dissolved reactive P varied from 27 to 63 mu g L-1 with the highest concentration measured from an area with intensive livestock production. Reducing P application and soil P status to the minimum level for crop growth is important for the environmental quality of surface waters.","balance and concentration and fertiliser and manure and surplus and water quality and AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS and P-AL and SOIL and NUTRIENT","10.1080/09064710.2013.872290     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2013.872290",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

Increasing concern over the environmental impact of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes. These schemes compensate farmers financially for any loss of income associated with measures that aim to benefit the environment or biodiversity. There are currently agri-environment schemes in 26 out of 44 European countries. 2. Agri-environment schemes vary markedly between countries even within the European Union. The main objectives include reducing nutrient and pesticide emissions, protecting biodiversity, restoring landscapes and preventing rural depopulation. In virtually all countries the uptake of schemes is highest in areas of extensive agriculture where biodiversity is still relatively high and lowest in intensively farmed areas where biodiversity is low. 3. Approximately $ 24·3 billion has been spent on agri-environment schemes in the European Union (EU) since 1994, an unknown proportion of it on schemes with biodiversity conservation aims. We carried out a comprehensive search for studies that test the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in published papers or reports. Only 62 evaluation studies were found originating from just five EU countries and Switzerland (5). Indeed 76% of the studies were from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where until now only c . 6% of the EU agri-environmental budget has been spent. Other studies were from Germany (6), Ireland (3) and Portugal (1). 4. In the majority of studies, the research design was inadequate to assess reliably the effectiveness of the schemes. Thirty-one percent did not contain a statistical analysis. Where an experimental approach was used, designs were usually weak and biased towards giving a favourable result. The commonest experimental design (37% of the studies) was a comparison of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes and control areas. However, there is a risk of bias if either farmers or scheme co-ordinators select the sites for agri-environment schemes. In such cases the sites are likely to have a higher biodiversity at the outset compared to the controls. This problem may be addressed by collecting baseline data (34% of studies), comparing trends (32%) or changes (26%) in biodiversity between areas with and without schemes or by pairing scheme and control sites that experience similar environmental conditions (16%). 5. Overall, 54% of the examined species (groups) demonstrated increases and 6% decreases in species richness or abundance compared with controls. Seventeen percent showed increases for some species and decreases for other species, while 23% showed no change at all in response to agri-environment schemes. The response varied between taxa. Of 19 studies examining the response of birds that included a statistical analysis, four showed significant increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and nine showed both increases and decreases. Comparative figures for 20 arthropod studies yielded 11 studies that showed an increase in species richness or abundance, no study showed a decrease and three showed both increases and",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00868.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00868.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems",NA

Representatives have to cope with environmental uncertainty and social stress associated with goal conflicts. This article advanced the understanding of representatives' coping strategies in response to perceived challenges and how these coping strategies are associated with social trust, focusing upon salient value similarity. A mixed-method approach, combining a questionnaire survey (n = 624) and interviews (n = 21) among landowners and hunter representatives, was employed. Survey results showed that the presence of emotion-centered coping strategies that involve venting of negative emotions and behavioral disengagement were associated with relatively lower trust, whereas problem-solving centered coping was associated with relatively higher trust. The interviews indicated the importance of appointing group leaders who are skilled at initiating dialogue and working toward decisions and compromises, as this seemed to hinder expressions of emotion-centered coping strategies.","Coping and social trust and moose and ecosystem-based management and COPING STRATEGIES and TRANSACTION COSTS and HUMAN FEAR and POPULATIONS and CHALLENGES and MODEL and TRUST and BEARS","10.1080/10871209.2019.1698081","https://doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2019.1698081",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

In Finland, Forest Act legislation has attempted to identify a set of key habitats (Forest Act habitats) to conserve biodiversity. The importance of Forest Act habitats (FAHs) for threatened vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes was studied in SW Finland. Of the populations of threatened species outside nature reserves 78% occurred in habitat types included in the Forest Act, but only 28% of the populations occurred in sites fulfilling the criteria defined in the Act. Most of these populations occurred in herb-rich forests, cliff forests and rock outcrops serving as hot spot habitats for threatened species. However, only 4% of the populations of threatened species occurring in sites fulfilling the criteria of the Forest Act were actually located in sites defined as FAHs by the forestry authorities. Furthermore, recent logging activities had often reduced the quality of defined FAH. In principle, FAHs have a potential to protect biodiversity in boreal forests, provided that the Act is properly implemented. However, the current study revealed an obvious gap between the Finnish forest legislation and its practical application, due to which the biodiversity targets of the Forest Act have been poorly fulfilled.

Complete, full-coverage vegetation surveys are often used for this purpose, but these are expensive undertakings. We have presented a method to downscale information from regional sampling surveys by poststratification using a land cover map derived from satellite-based measures of reflectance values. This approach opens new prospects for landscape-level evaluation of productivity. We applied this method to eight grazing districts (19-245 km(2)) in Setesdal Vesthei, Norway, in 2006. Sheep densities in three of eight grazing districts of Setesdal Vesthei fluctuated above the estimated grazing capacity. We fitted 43 sheep with Global Positioning System collars in two contrasting grazing districts in 2007-2008 to assess their selection of the land cover productivity classes in the map used for poststratification. In the area with high vegetation coverage, sheep selection increased in areas with an overall higher productivity, supporting the main basis of the approach. However, in the grazing districts with lower vegetation coverage, selection was higher for areas of overall low vegetation productivity. The likely explanation is the presence of small areas of snow bed vegetation with high-quality forage in areas with a generally rocky surface. Our study provides a first step toward a grazing capacity evaluation to achieve a sustainable management of sheep on alpine ranges of Scandinavia, and our approach is likely applicable to other open alpine ranges in the northern hemisphere.","Global Positioning System and habitat selection and land cover and poststratification and resource selection functions and rangeland management and SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION and LAND-COVER and LARGE HERBIVORE and HABITAT SELECTION and ANIMAL HUSBANDRY and HILL VEGETATION and DENSITY and LIVESTOCK and MODEL and THRESHOLDS and Sheep","10.2111/REM-D-12-00177.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.2111/REM-D-12-00177.1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Conceptual work / scenarios"

The comparative analysis reveals clear dependence on the latitude (and, therefore, on the changing environmental conditions) correlated with the wild ungulate abundance and diversity. Following a geographic pattern, the wolf is specialised on different species of ungulates: moose and reindeer in Scandinavia, red deer in Central and Eastern Europe and wild boar in Southern Europe. Where this large prey is taken, the roe deer is hunted with almost the same frequency in every region. The wolf diet in Europe shows two ecological adaptations formed by a complex of variables: 1. Wolves living in natural habitats with abundance of wild ungulates feed mainly on wild prey. 2. In highly anthropogenic habitats, with low abundance of wild prey, wolves feed on livestock (where husbandry of domestic animals is available) and take also a lot of plant food, smaller prey (hares and rodents) and garbage food. The frequency of occurrence of wild ungulates in the diet of wolves in North Europe varies from 54.0% in Belarus to 132.7% in Poland, while that of livestock is in the range from 0.4% in Norway to 74.9% in Belarus. In South Europe, the frequency of occurrence of wild prey varies from 0% in Italy and Spain to 136.0% in Italy, while of domestic ungulates ranges between 0% and 100% in Spain. The low density or lack of wild prey triggers the switch of the wolf diet to livestock, plant food (32.2-85% in Italy) or even garbage (up to 41.5% in Italy).","Wolf and Canis lupus and prey and adaptive strategy and BIALOWIEZA PRIMEVAL FOREST and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and FOOD-HABITS and ROE DEER and UNGULATE ABUNDANCE and TROPHIC ECOLOGY and FEEDING-HABITS and WOLVES and PREDATION and WILD and Europe",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

A comparison of three area-based conservation tools for wood-living species in boreal forests","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","Loss of natural forests and decline in forest biodiversity has led to several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for conservation measures is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based conservation measures commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags. Eight replicated sites for each of the three conservation measures were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species. We found larger differences in species composition between conservation measures for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the conservation measures. There was considerable variation in response to conservation measures between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides. Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the conservation measures, while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all conservation measures. We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies.

Here we use the first long-term dataset on an entire oak-living beetle community in hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) to ask whether policy-driven conservation actions aimed at vulnerable species can also be proactive for unthreatened, but irreplaceable species. Hollow oaks are vital keystone structures that are rich in both vulnerable and irreplaceable wood-living beetles. We sampled in excess of 23,000 individuals from 307 species over four seasons, across the oak range in Norway. We assessed the importance of key environmental variables for vulnerable, irreplaceable and generalist species. We show that simple management actions taken to benefit vulnerable species in hollow trees could also contribute to preventing the decline of important, irreplaceable species. Clearing regrowth is predicted to increase vulnerable species richness by 75-100%, specialist richness by 65%, and to benefit two generalist species. Regrowth clearance is likely to be similarly beneficial in all oak-based habitats with hollow trees across Europe and North America. Increased oak circumference and local habitat quantity were also beneficial for species richness and influenced species composition. Based on this we provide advice for targeting conservation action. We suggest economic, carbon and recreational benefits of clearance that could increase the attractiveness of conservation for policy-makers. We show the importance of examining large-scale conservation planning principles at a local scale to elicit how they work on the ground where conservation actually happens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In particular, concern is raised for several forest-dwelling species such as capercaillie and black grouse, because their habitats are continuously changing and deteriorating from human development. Conservation of these species is linked to sustainable forest management that seeks to benefit multiple species, which demands knowledge about demographic rates in relation to forest composition and structure. We related the spatial variation in adult density and chick production of capercaillie and black grouse to landscape characteristics from 13 areas within the boreal forest of Norway. Linear mixed effects models showed that black grouse and capercaillie had similar associations to landscape characteristics. Adult density of both species was positively related to the proportion of old forest (> 80 years), but only if the area had large proportions of mid to high productive forests. Chick production was negatively related to the proportion of old forest, but positively to habitat diversity and more so for black grouse compared to capercaillie. However, the result for chick production suggest that other forest types also are important, and that forest grouse needs a variety of habitats during their life history stages. Management that seeks to simultaneously conserve populations of black grouse and capercaillie needs to ensure a matrix of various forest types. A special focus must be on the critical life history of local populations to successfully preserve viable populations, for black grouse and capercaillie this implies protection of old and mid to high productive forest while keeping a heterogeneous landscape.","Adult density and Chick production and Forest composition and Landscape heterogeneity and Tetrao tetrix and Tetrao urogallus and Wildlife ecology and CAPERCAILLIE TETRAO-UROGALLUS and BLACK-GROUSE and BOREAL FOREST and HABITAT SELECTION and POPULATIONS and MODELS and SIZE and FRAGMENTATION and MORTALITY and PREDATION and Trees","10.1007/s10980-013-9960-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-013-9960-3",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

These epiphytes embed in the waxy epicuticle of apple fruit and colonies become visible in mid- to late summer. The blemished fruit are not marketable as fresh produce. Previous surveys of orchards in central and eastern USA and southern Europe found SBFS assemblages that were unique to geographic region. In the USA, SBFS species diversity was higher in orchards that received no fungicide sprays than those receiving fungicide sprays, suggesting that orchard management was an important determinant of SBFS species distribution and prevalence. To test the hypothesis that the composition of the SBFS complex is affected by geographic region and orchard management practices in Norway, 35 sites with a range of different management practices and cultivars were sampled. Colonies on each apple were counted according to the mycelial type, and subsamples of each mycelial type were amplified and sequenced using either primers specific to the rDNA of Capnodiales or a universal fungal primer pair for the large subunit of rDNA. Results indicated that a single genus was associated with each mycelial type. Seven genera known to cause SBFS were identified: Microcyclospora, Dissoconium, Peltaster, Microcyclosporella, Phaeothecoidiella, Schizothyrium, and Geastrumia. The percent composition of each site's SBFS assemblage was estimated to genus. Significant differences were found in SBFS assemblages among geographic districts and management practices, and there was a significant interaction of district and management. Organic orchards tended to have the least SBFS severity and genus diversity, whereas higher SBFS diversity tended to occur in abandoned than managed orchards. This is the first survey of SBFS fungi in apple orchards in Scandinavia.","Biodiversity and Malus x domestica and Survey and LSU and ITS and Epiphytic fungi and 1ST REPORT and FUNGI and CHINA and INFECTION and DIVERSITY and PELTASTER and GENERA and FRUIT and Norway","10.1007/s10658-014-0548-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0548-9",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

The reconstructions, based on 18 common taxa, show development of a forested landscape until c. 5600 cal yr BP, followed by several phases of opening and reforestation, probably connected to variation in the intensity and type of human impact. From c. 5600 cal yr BP (Early Neolithic) to c. 3200 cal yr BP (Early Bronze Age), a general increase in openness takes place, with increased deforestation c. 4300 and 4000 cal yr BP. More extensive forest clearances are seen at 2750 cal yr BP (Late Bronze Age) and 1800 cal yr BP (Roman Iron Age). Reforestation is recognised at c. 5400, 4100, 3600, 2900, 1900, 1200, 700 and 300 cal yr BP. Calluna is present in the vegetation both in the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, and heathland expansion is inferred to take place in the Late Bronze Age, with further expansion c. 1800 and 950 cal yr BP, probably reflecting increased use of outfield resources at the expense of grasslands. Forest disturbance and grazing are inferred to have taken place from 5600 cal yr BP, and communities comparable to historical time periods have existed from 2750 cal yr BP. An expansion in the area used for cereal cultivation probably took place in the Roman Iron Age. In the last century, from c. 1920, an expansion of conifers takes place, and Picea shows a strong increase during the last twenty years. Changes in both forest composition and land-cover are more clearly reflected with the REVEALS model than from the pollen percentage diagram, and the probability of presence of taxa within the region is demonstrated.

The regional estimates of vegetation cover as well as local differences between the sites are clearly demonstrated. The coast has been more open than the inner region in all time periods, with less than c. 70% tree cover prior to 5700 cal. BP. On a regional scale the tree cover was c. 90% in the same time period. Gradual opening of the regional forest started between 5700 and 5200 cal. BP. Forest disturbances, probably related to agriculture, are found both at the inner coast and in the inner fjord prior to 4200 cal. BP. Marked openings of the forests took place c. 4200 cal. BP at the outer coast, and c. 3700 cal. BP at the inner coast and inner fjord. From this time, heathlands dominated the open landscape at the coast. In the inner fjord region, grasslands in combination with cereal cultivation characterized the landscape. The inner coast area shows mixed vegetation cover with heathlands, grasslands and cultivated fields. Implementation of LRA suggests a stronger west east vegetation gradient than indicated in the pollen percentage diagrams. The results show the potential of the LRA-approach in archaeological research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, forests should be managed on the basis of the principles of sustainable forestry. However, economics have driven such forestry practices, resulting in dramatic changes to the natural structure and dynamics of Finnish forests. Commercial forests should, however, also provide habitats for various organisms, and forestry activities should not reduce forest biodiversity. Indicators can provide useful information on the ecological status and trends in sustainable forestry, such information can then be used by decision-makers. In attempts to develop accurate and reliable indicators, it has been suggested that statistical data, inventory data and data on many taxa may prove useful. The richness of game species and the abundance of the Siberian flying squirrel have been considered as candidate indicators for sustainable forestry. Indicators of sustainable forestry are commonly used separately and the interrelations between the ecological, economic and social dimensions of forestry have rarely been studied. In this paper we examine associations between the abundance of animal species (16 game species and Siberian flying squirrels) and their co-occurrence with forest structural characteristics that are considered to be indicators of sustainable forestry. We were also interested in examining regional patterns of the variables, and determining which socioeconomic indicators and land-use factors were associated (positively or negatively) with areas of forest for which there were indicators suggesting a good ecological condition. The study area consisted of 39 observation units. Based on our exploratory and descriptive analyses we suggest that using indices for different wildlife species groups and relative abundances of the Siberian flying squirrel together with forest structural characteristics and adequate socio-cultural variables could provide relevant information about trends in sustainable forestry. The application of indicators always depends on socio-cultural contexts and biogeographical factors, and these must be taken into consideration when making predictions or comparing different regions.

To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their rela-tionships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being.

As a consequence, much focus has been placed on the engineering of structural flood mitigation measures in rivers.

In earlier studies in the region of eastern Finland, stakeholders did not see a possible conflict between increased bioenergy use and nature conservation; this finding is contrary to the results of other studies. The aim of this study was to test with a quantitative modelling approach whether the stakeholder expectation holds and whether forest management in eastern Finland can simultaneously increase biomass utilization and biodiversity protection. Prior to this study, three alternative scenarios on forest resource use were created in a participatory stakeholder process, involving a broad range of stakeholders, with half of them being from research and education. In the current study, a large-scale forest resource planning model (MELA) and a sustainability impact assessment tool (ToSIA) were used to simulate the different alternative scenarios and present the results back to the stakeholders in order to evaluate them. The scenarios were evaluated by stakeholders using multi-criteria analysis. In a survey, the stakeholders indicated that biodiversity, employment, recreational value and greenhouse gas emissions were the most important indicators to them, whereas growing stock, amount of harvested roundwood, energy wood and protected forest area were considered less important. Of the created scenarios, the scenario combining bioenergy and biodiversity targets was the most preferred by the stakeholders as it performed well on those indicators that were identified by stakeholders as the most important. In this scenario, the area of protected forest and bioenergy production were increased simultaneously. With this study we offer a framework for evaluating different alternatives for future land use. The framework helps to identify key issues that are important to the stakeholders so that they can be taken into consideration in future land-use planning. In addition, the results confirm the stakeholder expectation that by protecting more forests while simultaneously increasing the mobilization of potentially available wood resources, both targets can be met without compromising too much other forest functions such as timber production and recreation.

Implementing this means that the complexity of interactions between social and ecological systems at multiple spatial scales and levels of governance needs to be understood. Place-based knowledge production and learning through integration of different research disciplines in collaboration with actors and stakeholders (i.e. transdisciplinary research) is a key feature to achieve this goal. Using a suite of local landscapes and regions on the European continent's West and East as a laboratory, we developed and applied a step-wise approach to produce knowledge and encourage learning towards functional green infrastructures. Our diagnoses of forest landscapes show that the functionality for wood production and biodiversity conservation was inversely related in the gradient from long to short forest management histories. In Europe's West there is a need for increased quantity of, and more functional, protected areas; diversification of management methods; and landscape restoration. In NW Russia there are opportunities to intensify forest management, and to continue the land-sparing approach with zoning for different functions, thus reducing biodiversity loss. Examples of diagnoses of social systems included the evaluation of comprehensive planning in Sweden, outcomes for biodiversity conservation of forest certification in Lithuania, and learning from environmental managers. We conclude that the main challenge for securing functional green infrastructure is poor cross-sectoral integration. Treatment of social-ecological systems requires knowledge-based collaboration and learning. The diversity of landscape histories and governance legacies on the European continent's West and East, including Russia, offers grand opportunities for both knowledge production about performance targets for green infrastructure functionality, as well as learning to adapt governance and management to regional contexts.

Substantial efforts at official levels are aimed towards sustainable development but also towards maintaining values of what may be termed vanishing landscapes. Selected areas and landscape features are set aside for protection or restoration. Individual efforts of this type have a long history in Sweden, and the issue has recently received increased attention, primarily due to more ambitious government goals concerning biodiversity conservation and Sweden's ratification of the European Landscape Convention. This has resulted in an increased scientific and official interest in vanishing values in the rural landscape, where parts of Eastern Europe, such as the Maramures district in Romania, have been used as model examples of land use regimes which in the past was common in Sweden. In this context, the dilemma of romanticizing peasants' use of land is highlighted and discussed more than has hitherto been done. This paper sheds light on some paradoxes inherent in official policies in relation to land use practices concerning the management of rural landscapes in Sweden, and relates the Swedish situation to a contrasting example of landscape practice in Romania. We discuss the concept of landscape care in relation to the construction and perception of landscape values and valuable landscapes through the lenses of rural realities and official policies. When Swedish authorities engage in the promotion of landscape care, they tend to work with slices of land, specific predefined values and individual farmers, and they often disregard the need to treat the landscape as a socio-ecological complex dynamic in space and time. We discuss how environmental policy generally could be improved through the adoption of a more inclusive and flexible approach towards aiding the different aims inherent in multifunctional rural landscapes.

One effect is an increasing variation in the views and the aesthetic values of the arable land. The Salix crops introduce new colours into the arable landscape. The green colour of the Salix fields lasts longer in the autumn. Also, from year to year a spatial Variation appears. The increasing wildlife shelter seems to make the fauna richer. Viewed as an energy crop only, the commercial competitiveness of energy forests is often low. However. if the benefits of energy crops as elements of the landscape are added, the socio-economic value could be substantial. Such landscape benefits include increasing biodiversity in the arable landscape, wind-shelter against soil erosion and snow. shelter for wildlife, the reduction of nitrogen leaching, views of the landscape and aesthetic considerations. and recovery of the organic soil component of arable land.

Yet, macrophytes can provide important refuge and nursery habitats for fish. Little is known about the consequences of macrophyte removal for fish behavioural space use and habitat selection. We hypothesised that macrophyte removal would affect brown trout (Salmo trutta) movement during the partial removal of the aquatic plant Juncus bulbosus (L.) in an oligotrophic impounded Norwegian river.We tagged 94 brown trout and tracked them using passive acoustic telemetry for 10 months and mapped the cover of J. bulbosus. Trout behavioural patterns were quantified as space use (utilisation areas 50% and 95%) which was linked to habitat use and selection for J. bulbosus. Removal of J. bulbosus influenced space use of brown trout by reducing the core utilisation area by 22%. Habitat use and selection were likewise influenced by removal with increased use and selection of areas with low J. bulbosus cover (<25%) with corresponding reduction in high J. bulbosus cover (>25–75%). Finally, diurnal differences in space use and habitat use were found, with 19% larger utilisation areas at night and higher use of areas with low J. bulbosus during daytime. Yet, all effect sizes were relatively small compared to the size of the study area.

Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk.

Since the 1990s, Sweden has attempted to reduce the negative impact of its forest management on biodiversity, after decades of intensive production forestry. In contrast, Lithuania has been intensifying forestry practices associated with the post-soviet socio-economic transition. Here we assess the actual outcomes by comparing selected forest structure and composition variables known to be indicators for forest biodiversity; and estimate the prospective trends by scrutinising current forest policies and management. Our results indicate that Lithuanian forests consistently possessed higher rankings in six indices related to tree species composition, stand age, and deadwood quantities that are positively associated with forest biodiversity. The reverse is indicated by those data on stand age and tree diameter that are associated with centennial dynamics in forest utilisation intensity. With respect to policy instruments, Lithuania designates a substantially greater share of forest area to non-timber functions and legislates more severe management restrictions in forests targeting timber production. Concurrently, all estimates of forestry activities indicate more intensive forest management in Southern Sweden, including a higher share of artificial regeneration and shorter rotations. This allows concluding that, if current forest management practices persist, then an increased ""biodiversity gap"" may be expected between the two countries. The study concludes with discussing to what degree the identified trends are the direct product of targeted policies versus merely by-products of other factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

More complex management goals, increasing involvement of stakeholders, and larger management units call for improved knowledge about reindeer-related values. We examined the responses of 1000 respondents to 39 statements of attitudes and values associated with wild reindeer presence and the management situation in two reindeer regions of southern Norway. We used a partial least-squares path modeling approach to examine the nexus between the attraction of wild reindeer, sustainability concerns, utilitarian and non-utilitarian values, conflicts, and attitudes toward hunting. The results show that local concepts of the sustainability of reindeer are based on opinions about the ecological requirements as well as the roles reindeer can play in the social and economic development of the communities. The attraction of reindeer is a function of consumptive as well as non-consumptive objectives. Segments of the community with different consumptive orientations can share ideas about the attraction of reindeer, but diverge in their interpretation of the sustainability of the species. Improved knowledge about the diversity and complexity of value orientations associated with wild reindeer can be a useful tool for developing multi-objective management frameworks with a diversity of stakeholders who may share similar values and interests, although they have different experience and knowledge bases.","wild reindeer and Norway and management and values and community development and ENVIRONMENTAL PARADIGM SCALE and NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT and VALUE ORIENTATIONS and INFRASTRUCTURE and FORESTRY and CARIBOU and MODELS and Social Values","10.14430/arctic4647     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic4647",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Mountains","Observational studies"

The study results were generated through the means of a survey which revealed a consistent high valuation among all respondents of ecosystem services relating to water quality, timber quality, recreation, and biodiversity. A majority of the respondents desired increasing proportions of mixed species and broadleaved stands within the future forest landscape. Certified forest owners who were members of a forest owner association (CMs) prioritized achieving high economic income through roundwood production with strong preferences for the ecosystem services high stand growth and high timber quality. For CMs, carbon substitution was the preferred means of mitigating climate change. Forest owners lacking both certification and membership in a forest owner association ranked the ecosystem services recreation and biodiversity significantly higher, and also preferred retaining more old forest within the landscape. The survey results revealed a higher management activity among CMs, resulting in a more frequent establishment of mixed and broadleaved stands. Forest owners with medium to large scale properties were well-represented within the CM category.

We studied connections between the contemporary predator management approach and the consequences of predation in reindeer husbandry within the reindeer management area in Finland. National and supranational management policies aim at biodiversity conservation; predator populations with favourable conservation status play an important role in this. The metapopulation status of large carnivores has been suffering from weak connections between Finland and Scandinavia, but such connections have the potential to be improved due to increased population sizes and changes in carnivore distribution in Finland. Although the sustainability of rural livelihoods is pursued concurrent with the recovering predator populations, the increasing amount of predation-caused reindeer damage has locally compromised the economic sustainability of reindeer husbandry and well-being of herders in Finland. If co-existence is pursued in the present situation, it will require both the development of novel coping strategies by herders to prevent damage, and adaptive management of predator populations. To increase the acceptance of predator protection by local communities, it is crucial to develop more interactive predator management strategies with a concrete role of local stakeholders to address trust issues between herders, policy makers and researchers. Open discussion on the population goals for predators in the reindeer management area as well as the desired role and status of reindeer husbandry is also needed. © 2020","Adaptation and Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and Large carnivores and Predator policies and Reindeer husbandry and Semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and Finland and Aquila and Aquila chrysaetos and Rangifer tarandus and Rangifer tarandus tarandus and adaptive management and animal husbandry and carnivore and deer and predation and predator and raptor and Prednisolone","10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.08.017","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.08.017",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

The study design accounted for changes in scenery and biodiversity indices in the forest environment resulting from forest management practices. Respondents were asked to choose their preferred management option from alternative management regimes for the sites. The options were characterized by different levels of attributes, which included site-specific species richness levels and forest scenery, costs of management, and indicators of species richness levels over the system of recreation sites. Results show that visitors have a strong preference for the preservation of species richness and for scenic beauty. However, when there is a trade-off between these benefits, visitors chose their favourite scenery at their favourite recreation site and prefer management options, which preserve biodiversity at the other sites in the recreation system. The study shows how modelling the sites as independent units of the forest management regime permit policy-relevant conclusions to be drawn regarding the specialisation and zoning of multiple-use objectives. The approach also allows for the development of hypothetical management scenarios and estimation of respective economic welfare changes for visitors from these scenarios. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A degrowth analysis of event participants’ perspective on environmental impacts","Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism","This paper highlights the challenges of self-limitation, providing insights into how event sport participants relate to and act within limits. From a cultural degrowth perspective that advocates for the need to practice self-limitation and reduce environmental waste from economic activities, we examine how event participants perceive physical impacts on nature during two types of nature-based events in Jämtland, Sweden. Based on 50 semi-structured interviews, observations and photo-elicitation observations, the findings reveal the difficulties of adhering to limitations. Initially, the informants considered only trash or greenhouse gas emissions as impacts but were stunned to see photos of how impacts such as trail and soil erosion had gone beyond what they imagined. However, responsibility for limiting the effects tended to shift to others, particularly the event organisers. These two events present a paradox in tourism. The convivial idea of visiting nature collides with resource utilisation that heavily impacts the environment. Management implications: Several suggestions of measures to consider emerged to limit impacts from participant and nature-based events, as well as for sport tourism in nature. While participants tend to transfer responsibility to the organisers and local authorities, creating awareness and guide them to a sustainable behaviour are highly appreciated. 1. Event organisers should implement stricter guidelines for participant behaviour, providing create encouragement, options and clear instructions to reduce environmental impacts, it may in very low degree decrease their experience, but more importantly shows signs of responsibility. 2. Acceptable restrictions could include walking a few metres, imposing penalties, and offering alternative routes. Local knowledge is crucial in this regard. Well-known in the respective sport should serve as role models, influencing participants to adopt more sustainable practises. 3. Policy makers must ensure that event organisers adhere to specific guidelines. Local governments must facilitate measures to protect the physical environment, providing flexibility to accommodate last-minute changes if necessary. 4.

Recent altitudinal range expansion and a perceived population increase have become topics of concern in Scandinavia, primarily due to the potential impacts of red foxes on both prey and competitor species. However, despite it being a common species, there is still surprisingly little knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics of its population dynamics. In this study, we synthesized 12 years of snow-track transect data covering a 27,000-km2 study area to identify factors associated with red fox distribution and population dynamics. Using Bayesian hierarchical regression models, we evaluated the relationships of landscape productivity and climate gradients as well as anthropogenic subsidies with an index of red fox population size and growth rates. We found that landscapes with high human settlement density and large amounts of gut piles from moose (Alces alces) hunting were associated with higher red fox abundances. Population dynamics were characterized by direct density-dependent growth, and the structure of density dependence was best explained by the amount of agricultural land in the landscape. Population equilibrium levels increased, and populations were more stable, in areas with a higher presence of agricultural lands, whereas density-dependent population growth was more prominent in areas of low agricultural presence. We conclude that human land use is a dominant driver of red fox population dynamics in the boreal forest. We encourage further research focusing on contrasting effects of anthropogenic subsidization on predator population carrying capacities and temporal stability, and potential impacts on prey dynamics. © 2020, The Author(s).","Density dependence and Human land use and Landscape ecology and Population dynamics and Red fox and Norway and Scandinavia and Alces alces and Vulpes and Vulpes vulpes and abundance and agricultural land and anthropogenic effect and boreal forest and canid and climate change and density dependence and growth rate and human activity and human settlement and land use and landscape and population growth and population size and range expansion and Humanities and Humanism and Humans","10.1007/s13364-020-00494-y","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13364-020-00494-y",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

However, the effects of habitat improvement schemes in power line clearings on components of diversity are poorly studied. We conducted a large-scale experiment to test the effects of different management practices on the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of wild bees in power line clearings (n=19 sites across southeastern Norway) and explored whether any treatment effects were modified by the environmental context. At each site, we conducted the following treatments: (1) Cut: all trees cut and left to decay in the clearing; (2) Cut+Remove: all trees cut and removed from the plot; and (3) Uncut: uncleared. The site-specific environmental context (i.e., elevation and floral diversity) influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity within bee species assemblages. The largest number of species was found in the Cut+Remove treatment in plots with a high forb species richness, indicating that the outcome of management practices depends on the environmental context. Clearing of treatment plots with many forb species also appeared to alter the phylogenetic composition of bee species assemblages, that is, more closely related species were found in the Cut and the Cut+Remove plots than in the Uncut plots. Synthesis and applications: Our experimental simulation of management practices in power line clearings influenced the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of bee species assemblages. Frequent clearing and removal of the woody debris at low elevations with a high forb species richness can increase the value of power line clearings for solitary bees. It is therefore important for managers to consider the environmental context when designing habitat improvement schemes for solitary bees.","Bees and biodiversity and functional diversity and habitat management and phylogenetic diversity and pollinators and power line clearings and COMMUNITIES and POLLINATORS and RESTORATION and FRAMEWORK and RESPONSES and DECLINES and BRITAIN and TRAITS and PLANTS","10.1002/ece3.1963     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1963",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","power line clearings","Observational studies"

A systematic literature review serves as a reference for the empirical analysis of a survey data on the Finnish NIPF owners’ stated willingness to adopt thirteen distinct forest management practices. Binary logit models reveal socio-demographic factors, site-specific characteristics, previous forest management, and motivations for forest ownership that are associated with the stated adoption of management practices. Especially, environmental and financial motivations play an important role in decisions concerning forest management practices. Statistically significant factors vary depending on the forest management practice, reflecting the NIPF owner heterogeneity. Younger and highly educated forest owners are more supportive for various management practices that promote biodiversity, while older forest owners are reluctant towards deadwood retention.

In Norway, family forest owners own 80% of productive forestland and play a central role in the management of the country's forests. Yet little is known about whether these landowners would be interested in increasing carbon sequestration on their land and selling carbon credits. Only a handful of studies have examined the factors that motivate family forest owners to participate in carbon offset programs, and all of these studies have been conducted in the United States. This study addresses this information gap using data from a mail survey of 1500 Norwegian family forest owners. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the effect of various carbon program, forestland, and landowner characteristics on participation in a hypothetical carbon offset program. Results suggest that there is a considerable amount of interest among Norwegian family forest owners and that the most important predictors of participation are payment amount offered, perceived barriers posed by management actions, importance placed on non-market forest amenities, and attitudes towards climate change.

A particular challenge in forest ecosystems is to reconcile demand for an increased timber production with provisioning of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, there is still little knowledge about how forest management could help solve this challenge. Hence, studies that investigate how to manage forests to reduce trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity are urgently needed to help forest owners and policy makers take informed decisions. We applied seven alternative forest management regimes using a forest growth simulator in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimated the potential of the landscape to provide harvest revenues, store carbon and maintain biodiversity across a 50-year time period. Then, we applied multiobjective optimization to identify the trade-offs between these three objectives and to identify the optimal combination of forest management regimes to achieve these objectives. It was not possible to achieve high levels of either carbon storage or biodiversity if the objective of forest management was to maximize timber harvest revenues. Moreover, conflicts between biodiversity and carbon storage became stronger when simultaneously targeting high levels of timber revenues. However, with small reductions in timber revenues, it was possible to greatly increase the multifunctionality of the landscape, especially the biodiversity indicators. Forest management actions, alternative to business-as-usual management, such as reducing thinnings, extending the rotation period and increasing the amount of area set aside from forestry may be necessary to safeguard biodiversity and non-timber ecosystem services in Fennoscandia.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that no forest management regime alone is able to maximize timber revenues, carbon storage and biodiversity individually or simultaneously and that a combination of different regimes is needed to resolve the conflicts among these objectives. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the trade-offs between different objectives by applying diversified forest management planning at the boreal landscape level and that we need to give up the all-encompassing objective of very intensive timber production, which is prevailing particularly in Fennoscandian countries.","biodiversity and carbon and climate change mitigation and climate regulation and ecosystem services and Finland and forest planning and multiobjective optimization and timber and trade-offs and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and CARBON STORAGE and TIMBER PRODUCTION and TRADE-OFFS and DEAD WOOD and BIODIVERSITY and FINLAND and CONSERVATION and EUROPE and IMPACT and Trees","10.1111/1365-2664.12790     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12790",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

This attribute-based contingent valuation study elaborated the supply side of potential payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism named Landscape and Recreational Values Trading (LRVT), proposed to enhance the provision of amenity values in privately owned forests located in tourism and recreation areas. Using a mail survey data set, we analyzed forest owners' willingness to participate in LRVT and the related compensation claims in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, Finland. We found that more restrictive rules regarding forest management practices decrease the probability of participating and increase forest owners' compensation claims in LRVT. Furthermore, forest owners seem to claim more compensation if, instead of private negotiations, competitive tendering is used to make contracts. Moreover, besides the protection of landscape values, biodiversity protection may be a motive for participation. This indicates that, in addition to improved landscape quality, respondents gain personal benefits from enhanced biodiversity in their own forests.

Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or longterm monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation.

A unique ten-year dataset provides an evaluation of the efficiency of voluntary actions at a local scale for implementing a policy of population control of geese, and general lessons are drawn for collaboration and co-production of knowledge for adaptive management. The study demonstrates how both the hunters and geese adapt in a situation where increasing the harvest of geese is the main objective. Introducing hunting-free days and safe foraging areas significantly increased goose numbers in the study area, with a corresponding increase in hunting success in terms of number of harvested geese. The geese's behavioural response to hunting also triggered the hunters to adapt accordingly by optimal timing and placement in the landscape. Based on the results of the present study we suggest a framework for local implementation of management actions.

The study is located in northern Finland in the area between two top-rated tourist resorts, Yllas and Levi. The results of the case study support the idea of an eligible integration between NBT and forestry, which takes into account scenic qualities of forested landscapes by restricting traditional management practices.

This study focused on possibilities to enhance the scenic and recreational values of private forests for nature-based tourism in Finland. More specifically, we studied forest owners’ attitudes towards – and willingness to participate in – a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiative called Landscape and Recreation Value Trade. We also investigated the acceptability of forest management alternatives sustaining landscape qualities, the relative importance of different features of Landscape and Recreation Value Trade for landowners, and the magnitude of overall compensation claims of alternative Landscape and Recreation Value Trade models. A choice experiment survey was conducted in Kuusamo, a popular nature-based tourism destination, located in northeastern Finland. The results show that several forest owners were interested in the suggested scheme if economic losses were to be compensated. The landowners’ preferences for Landscape and Recreation Value Trade were somewhat heterogeneous, suggesting that private forest owners in Kuusamo have rather diverse motivations and objectives for their ownership. Owners who stated to have scenic landscapes on their land, and those living outside Kuusamo area, were more willing to join in the suggested mechanism. In general, landowners’ willingness to participate was strongly dependent on the amount of compensation as well as on other terms of the contract, such as the duration and severity of harvesting restrictions.

In the forest regions of Dalarna and interior Maine: hopes are pinned on nature-based tourism, with the presumption that natural capital is underutilized. This paper explores the potential and pitfalls of nature tourism as a basis for sustainable rural development in regions where most land is held privately but quasi-open access for recreation has been either a right (Dalarna) or a customary entitlement (Maine). The paper applies theories of common pool resources and impure public goods to show that both property regimes are mal-adapted for sustainable nature tourism. Limited exclusion combined with rivalness in land uses mis-aligns incentives facing landowners, tourists, and recreation businesses. Short-term effects include congestion, reduced economic opportunity, and depressed production of non-recreational goods. Longer-term effects include environmental degradation and weak incentives for value-added investment. Tourism development is further impeded by a scale mis-match between small ownerships and large efficient recreation management units. The analysis suggests that sustainable nature tourism faces four land use challenges. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The importance of type of human intervention and the level of biodiversity for preference and intention to engage in recreation activities were examined in a sample of forestry and social science students in Sweden. Results showed that forestry students displayed an almost equally strong preference for natural-looking scenes as for scenes with traces of recreation (e. g., paths), whereas social science students preferred recreational scenes the most. Least preferred were scenes with traces of forest management. Different forest settings were furthermore preferred for different recreation activities. Recreational settings were favored for walking and going on outings, and natural-looking settings were more appreciated for picking berries or mushrooms. Respondents displayed a stronger intention to study plants and animals in high biodiversity settings and the intention to exercise was stronger in low biodiversity settings. Implications for future land use planning and forest management are discussed.","forest scene preference and recreation activities and human intervention and biodiversity and forest experience and WILD BERRY PICKING and LANDSCAPE and PERCEPTIONS and MANAGEMENT and BEAUTY and BIODIVERSITY and AESTHETICS and ATTITUDES and FINLAND and RATINGS and Recreation","10.3390/f3040923     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/f3040923",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Domestic forest policy changes as response to absorb pressure to integrate biodiversity conservation, bioenergy use and climate protection in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden","LAND USE POLICY","In this paper, we analyse how and why domestic forest policies in Europe have responded to pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation, climate and bioenergy policies. We use content analysis of documents and interviews to analyse change and stability in domestic forest policy goals, instruments and practices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over time. We find that decision-makers in forest policy and practice responded to pressure to integrate biodiversity into forestry through four different types of policy change outcomes and processes. Depending on the context, these responses included layering, drift, conversion and/or replacement. In all countries, the forest policy changes were driven by (partly shifting) coalitional politics and changes in external conditions. Domestic forest policy regimes shifted from 'timber production' towards 'multifunctional', 'sustainable forest management' or 'biodiversity' primacy, and then back to 'timber harvesting'. Forest policy also integrated bioenergy and climate change policies in order to minimise pressure by EU and national biodiversity policy sectors and to enable 'timber harvesting' (re-)turns in forest policy. We conclude that policy integration processes and the shifts in forest policy they contain refer to a sectoral resilience, that is, the ability of forest policy to react to, minimise, and absorb pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation policies.","Biodiversity and Coalitional politics and Europe and Policy change and Policy integration and Sustainable forest management and ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK and NATURA 2000 and SUSTAINABILITY and CERTIFICATION and INDICATORS and CHALLENGES and DISCOURSE and COHERENCE and SCIENCE and LINKING and Sweden and France","10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.034     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.034",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Incoherent policies may negatively impact the sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services (FES), and forest multifunctionality. There is uncertainty among policymakers about the impacts of policies on the real world. We translated the policy documents of Finland into scenarios including the quantitative demands for FES, representing: the national forest strategy (NFS), the biodiversity strategy (BDS), and the bioeconomy strategy (BES). We simulated a Finland-wide systematic sample of forest stands with alternative management regimes and climate change. Finally, we used multi-objective optimization to identify the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario and analysed their long-term effects on FES. The NFS scenario proved to be the most multifunctional, targeting the highest number of FES, while the BES had the lowest FES targets. However, the NFS was strongly oriented towards the value chain of wood and bioenergy and had a dominating economic growth target, which caused strong within-policy conflicts and hindered reaching biodiversity targets. The BDS and BES scenarios were instead more consistent but showed either sustainability gaps in terms of providing timber resources (BDS) or no improvements in forest biodiversity (BES). All policy scenarios resulted in forest management programs dominated by continuous cover forestry, set-aside areas, and intensive management zones, with proportions depending on the policy focus. Our results highlight for the first time the conflicts among national sectoral policies in terms of management requirements and effects on forest multifunctionality. The outcomes provide leverage points for policymakers to increase coherence among future policies and improve implementation of multiple uses of forests. © 2022 The Authors","Biodiversity and Climate change and Ecosystem services and Forest management and Forest policy and Multi-objective optimization and Chains and Economics and Ecosystems and Finland and Forest Management and Forestry and Specifications and Multiobjective optimization and Timber and Forest ecosystem and Management regime and Multi-objectives optimization and Multifunctionality and National forest strategies and Policy makers and Sectoral policies and Trees","10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102689","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2022.102689",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

The analysis draws on the participants’ own account of the process, elicited via interviews and questionnaires. We attend to critical context and process factors to account for the success of the collaborative process and evaluate the effectiveness of the agreement in terms of ecological and social outcomes. The process created a practical agreement, which increased the share of protected forests and introduced new biodiversity protection measures for commercial and recreational forests. It also created innovative solutions, like the new concept of a nature value forest, which helped the parties to negotiate around their differences. However, disagreement over the impacts of forest management practices, especially continuous cover forestry, remained. The crucial contextual conditions contributing to the agreement were strong initiating leadership and political mandate, which motivated the participants to engage in collaborative dialogue and stick with the process. The key process factors were a third-party facilitation and joint fact-finding. Most importantly, the process was not constrained by a pre-defined agenda or assumptions related to the status quo, but the participants were granted considerable influence over decisions and outputs. © 2023 The Author(s).

Its legitimacy depends on its ability to achieve its objectives and to retain the support of stakeholders such as NGOs and the companies that adopt it. This study presents a novel approach for assessing the contributions of forest certification to biodiversity conservation, based on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in four northern European countries (Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia). In each case, national FSC certification requirements related to specific biodiversity targets were compared with requirements in national legislation. Nearly 80% of the assessed certification requirements were more prescriptive than the national legislation. One-third of these requirements (3–8 per country) were assessed to have a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation, whereas four requirements (up to 2 per country) were assessed to have a low positive contribution. FSC requirements to protect Woodland Key Habitats were identified as having a positive contribution in all four countries, whereas requirements regarding live tree retention in harvests and preserving dead wood had a positive contribution in three countries each.

Brown bear populations of North Western Russia, Finland and Northern Norway have been assumed to form one large, continuous population; however this hypothesis has not been tested sufficiently. We have genotyped 1,887 samples from 2005 to 2008 from four distinct areas and used the resulting DNA profiles from 146 different individuals to analyze the genetic diversity, population structure, and the migration rates among groups. In addition, we have tested for traces of previous genetic bottlenecks. Individuals from Eastern Finland and Russian Karelia were grouped in the same cluster (""Karelia""), while distinctive subpopulations of brown bears were detected in the north (""Pasvik""), and the east (""Pinega""). All three subpopulations displayed high genetic variation, with expected heterozygosities (H (E)) of 0.77-0.81, but differentiation among the clusters was relatively low (average F (ST) = 0.051, P < 0.001). No evidence of genetic bottlenecks in the past was found. We detected a highly significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern. For Pasvik, self-recruitment was found to be very high (96%), pointing to the possibility of genetic isolation. In contrast, between Karelia and Pinega we detected high, bi-directional migration rates (similar to 30%), indicating genetic exchange. Conclusively, despite of a substantial influence of IBD on the genetic structure in the region, we detected considerable variation in connectivity among the identified clusters that could not be explained solely by the distance between them.","Gene flow and Isolation-by-distance and Non-invasive genetic sampling and Microsatellites and Migration and Population structure and SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE and MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS and COMPUTER-PROGRAM and CONSERVATION GENETICS and BLACK BEAR and SIZE and FLOW and DNA and DISPERSAL and SOFTWARE and Europe","10.1007/s10592-012-0317-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0317-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is uninformative on the prevalence of perspectives in the general population. The Norwegian government considers planting spruce climate forests on abandoned pastures, the habitat for many red listed species. We identify three prevailing stakeholder perspectives in the climate forest debate using the Q method; one pro climate forest and two against with differing motivations. Using the so-called scale creation method (Danielson, 2009) and a national survey, we measure the support of the general population for these perspectives and elicit their concern for ecosystem services. About half of the sample is pro climate forest. Opposition is greater in regions where spruce is uncommon and abandoned pastures are common. The impact of climate forests on biodiversity and landscapes is a concern. Conflicts would be dampened if climate forest policy took impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity better into account. Our proposed generalised Q method combines two strengths: the depth of the Q method with the breadth of the general population survey. The method demonstrates a way forward in ecological economics to better capture representative values and perspectives in ecosystem service management and help design climate and environmental policies with greater acceptance. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change and Conservation and Ecosystem services and Forest and Q Method and Values and Norway and Picea and biodiversity and climate change and conservation status and ecological economics and ecosystem management and ecosystem service and esthetics and forest ecosystem and forestry policy and landscape ecology and numerical method and resource use","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106588","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106588",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored. 2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way. 3. At the site where relative reindeer numbers and trampling intensity had increased the most, graminoid-dominated vegetation was now also found in the moderately grazed area. At the other site, the dominant vegetation types under all grazing intensities were the same as 14 years earlier. 4. We show that the heavily grazed, graminoid-dominated areas stored less C above-ground than the lightly grazed, shrub-dominated areas. Yet, the below-ground consequences of grazing-induced grassification varied between the sites: Grazing did not alter organic soil C stocks at the site where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs were abundant in the lightly grazed area, whereas heavy grazing increased organic soil C stocks at the site where the deciduous shrub Betula nana was dominant. 5. Our results indicate that, despite the negative impacts of grazers on above-ground C storage, their impact on below-ground C may even be positive. We suggest that the site-specific responses of organic soil C stocks to grazing could be explained by the differences in vegetation under light grazing. This would imply that the replacement of deciduous shrubs by graminoids, as a consequence of grazing could be beneficial for C sequestration in tundra soils.","carbon stocks and grazing and herbivory and plant functional types and plant-soil interactions and Rangifer tarandus and reindeer and soil carbon and ARCTIC TUNDRA and LITTER DECOMPOSITION and ECOLOGICAL ROLE and SHRUB and REINDEER and SUMMER and RESPONSES and SEQUESTRATION and LANDSCAPE and EXCLUSION","10.1111/1365-2435.13029     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13029",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

A scenario exercise for integrating conservation and reindeer herding in northeast Finland","Pastoralism: Research, Policy and Practice","Nature conservation is often seen as incompatible with pastoralism: conserved predators can cause significant harm to livestock, or livestock may conquer space from natural species. Currently, nature conservation and related policies are increasingly framed through the notion of ecosystem services, which form basis for human well-being. What are the implications of this framing in the relationships between pastoralism and conservation? To answer this question, we draw from our previous research to build four scenarios on the relationships between reindeer herding and nature conservation in northeast Finland. In the two ecosystem service, ‘user’ scenarios reindeer herders are seen to degrade nature, and thus should be controlled. In the first scenarios, reindeer herding is still compensated for its losses to predation, but in the second scenario, ‘reindeer farming’ and free grazing practises are eroded for achieving conservation objectives. If herding is viewed as a producer of ecosystem services, the herders' incentivised function would be to sustain predator populations and resemble natural species (wild forest reindeer). In our two ‘producer’ scenarios, new professions as ecosystem stewards or as ecotourism entrepreneurs emerge and herding changes from meat production priority to supporting the production of other ecosystem services. Novel solutions to conservation-pastoralism dilemmas might emerge if pastoral communities are seen as potential producers of ecosystem services. However, ‘producer-based’ conservation practises also include various uncertainties and might have negative impacts on pastoral communities' well-being, especially on the continuity of social and cultural traditions.","Finland","10.1186/2041-7136-2-11","https://doi.org/10.1186/2041-7136-2-11",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

Due to a long history of sustained yield wood production to satisfy the needs of the forest industry, clearfelling management systems are used in similar to 96 per cent of managed forests in Sweden. To satisfy the intentions of contemporary forest and land use policies, uneven-aged forest management systems as a complement are currently debated. We interviewed local forestry stakeholders in the Swedish boreal forest region's north and south about their views on and attitudes towards different forest management systems' contribution to SFM. Most stakeholders were generally negative to the use of uneven-aged system for sustained yield wood production but saw advantages for ecological and socio-cultural dimensions of SFM. To encourage the use of even-aged cohort and uneven-aged systems to satisfy all dimensions of SFM, there is a need for improved communication, education and public awareness. This could ultimately lead to a more constructive and less heated debate. In addition, there is a need of more empirically based knowledge about uneven-aged and cohort forest management systems' pros and cons when it comes to satisfying economical, ecological and socio-cultural objectives.","NATURAL STAND STRUCTURES and BIODIVERSITY and DYNAMICS and CONSERVATION and LANDSCAPES and GROWTH and Sweden and Aged and Aging","10.1093/forestry/cpr034     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpr034",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Based on an analysis of 62 cases, we identified population growth, overlapping land rights, ethnic fragmentation, and economic inequality as the most frequently reported root causes, while rises in land prices was the most often reported proximate cause.

In Finland, these requirements are, to some extent, fulfilled through application of the Akwe: Kon Voluntary Guidelines, a protocol developed by the CBD for cultural, environmental, and social impact assessment to be applied in regions inhabited or used by Indigenous peoples. However, although the Akwe: Kon Guidelines have been in use for several years, studies addressing their practical application are scarce. We set out to examine the use of the Akwe: Kon Guidelines, inclusion of traditional and local knowledge (TLK), as well as the related improvements and challenges in land use planning in the Municipality of Eanodat in Finnish Sapmi. We conducted key-informant interviews with local Sami experts and local land use planning officials and examined recent land use and management plans for wilderness and conservation areas. Regarding the incorporation of TLK into land use planning, officials identified practical challenges, such as a mismatch between the oral narrative nature of TLK and the planning systems currently in use, and pointed to a need to make TLK more spatially explicit. The concerns of the Sami were deeply tied to the survival of their culture and traditional livelihoods, reindeer herding in particular. The Sami informants were unanimous about the need to amend the Reindeer Husbandry Act (848/1990), to better recognize the traditional Sami ways of herding and knowledge embedded in it. Having strengthened the opportunities of the Sami to participate in management planning, application of the Akwe: Kon Guidelines is a much welcome development. However, because of the voluntary nature of the Guidelines, their power may be limited in the current situation, where Sami herders' rights are not settled in national legislation governing reindeer husbandry.","Akwe: Kon Guidelines and land use planning and Sami reindeer herding and traditional and local knowledge and wilderness areas and ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE and RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT and REINDEER HUSBANDRY and NATURAL-RESOURCES and COMANAGEMENT and POLITICS and PARTICIPATION and FOREST and GIS and INTEGRATION","10.5751/ES-10735-240120     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10735-240120",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

These changes may further lead to depletion of genetic variation within populations as well as accelerating differentiation among populations. As a migratory species requiring large living areas, wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is highly vulnerable to human activity. The number and continued presence of wild reindeer have been significantly reduced due to accelerating anthropogenic habitat modifications, as well as displacement in benefit of domesticated herds of the species. As a basis for future management strategies we assess genetic structure and levels of genetic variation in Norwegian wild reindeer by analysing 12 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region in 21 management units with varying population sizes. Overall, both markers showed highly varying levels of genetic variation, with reduced variation in the smaller and more isolated populations. The microsatellite data indicated a relationship between population size and genetic variation. This relationship was positive and linear until a threshold for population size was reached at approximately 1500 reindeer. We found high levels of differentiation among most populations, indicating low levels of gene flow, but only a weak correlation between geographic and genetic distances. Our results imply that the genetic structure of Norwegian wild reindeer is mainly driven by recent colonization history, population size, as well as human-induced landscape fragmentation, restricting gene flow and leading to high levels of genetic drift.

This paper describes the scientific foundation for management according to conservation limits and management targets for Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon, a highly valued and heavily exploited anadromous fish species. Based on stock recruitment relationships during the freshwater phase, the biomass of females necessary to attain the carrying capacity (yielding average maximum recruitment) has been established as conservation limits for each of the 439 Norwegian populations. Using a simulation model based on reported catch and estimates of exploitation rates, the probability and percentage attainment of the conservation limits have been assessed annually since 2008, and exploitation advice provided for 176 of the largest populations. The number of populations that attained their conservation limits increased substantially after the new management scheme was introduced, despite that the number of returning salmon remained at historical low levels. Overall the populations evaluated in 2011 were at 95% of their conservation limits compared to 91% in 2008 and 85% in 2005. The improvement could largely be attributed to reduced exploitation rates, due to new restrictions in both the marine and river fisheries. The new management scheme also improved the catch statistics and stimulated data acquisition for management.

A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distriuted windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anscriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are require. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.","birds and environmental impact assessment and environmental policy and meta-analysis and renewable energy and systematic review and CONSERVATION PRACTICE and ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT and METAANALYSIS and SUPPORT and FARMS and MANAGEMENT","10.1017/S0376892907003554     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892907003554",NA,NA,NA,"Mountains","Summarised evidence"

Some of the surviving fragments are managed as pasture but the grazing regime required to maintain their relict flora is unproven. We conducted a systematic review and analysed available data to ascertain the impact of grazing on species richness and the abundance of important plant species. We found the evidence base to be poor but with some potential for meaningful integration of existing datasets. Analyses of complementary datasets from Welsh mesotrophic grassland demonstrates that livestock type and vegetation height significantly impact on the plant community composition. However, the differences in species richness and forb abundance between livestock types are not ecologically significant, and grazing intensity appears to be more important than species of grazer. Managers must balance changes in bryophyte abundance, forb diversity and plant species richness to achieve tradeoffs appropriate to their conservation objectives. The poor evidence base necessitates flexible, site-based management and rigorous monitoring where grazing of important mesotrophic pastures is undertaken. Further evidence regarding interactions between grazing intensity and livestock type is noticeably lacking, precluding prediction regarding livestock type impacts at given stocking intensities. Lack of detailed knowledge of land-use history is a major impediment and there is little information regarding taxa other than vascular plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The relationship between plant and pollen presences was quantified using association, over-and under-representation indices. Each taxon was related to its mode of pollination and characteristics of the flowers as well as to the size of its pollen grain. A pattern was found for anemophilous species and for species with open blossoms and numerous freely exposed anthers. These had the best association between the presence of the pollen and the plant. Their pollen was also found more often in the pollen assemblages than in the vegetation, and their pollen grain sizes are most often less than 40 mu m. Entomophilous species with few freely exposed anthers or concealed anthers were found to have a good association between plant and pollen presences or, most often, they were under-represented. Different pollen grain sizes are connected to this group. These results indicate that the presence of pollen of specialized entomophilous taxa and of pollen of taxa with open flowers, but few anthers reflect local occurrence in the vegetation. Their presence may therefore be important in interpreting land-use practices in pollen diagrams from soil profiles, whereas pollen percentages must be taken into account in interpreting the occurrence of pollen of anemophilous taxa and entomophilous taxa with open flowers and numerous exposed anthers from soil deposits.

But as plant functional traits and functional diversity underpin ecosystem dynamics, understanding drivers of functional diversity at biogeographical scales is essential to understand spatial variation in ecosystem characteristics, particularly in light of ongoing environmental changes. Here we investigate geographic patterns of functional diversity and -traits of the Norwegian flora. We explore whether climate, land-use or glacial history are important drivers of functional diversity. We combine species occurrence records and assemblage-means of functional traits to assess the spatial distribution of functional traits and -diversity of native vascular plants in Norway in a 20 × 20 km grid. We use multiple-model inference to identify which environmental factors contribute the most in explaining the spatial patterns of trait distributions and functional diversity. Additionally, we use the constructed models to predict potential changes in distributions of traits and functional diversity given different climate change scenarios. Both individual traits and functional diversity display clear geographic patterns, predictable by climate, landscape and glacial history. Traits related to plant size and growth peak in warmer areas and are predicted to increase in the future, as is functional richness and dispersion. In contrast, functional evenness peaks in northern regions and is predicted to decrease in the future. The different environmental drivers vary in degree of importance, effect sizes and -directions on the assemblage-averaged functional traits and -diversity. This underlines the importance of multiple drivers in determining plant assemblage functionality. In the face of climate- and land-use change, Norway is expected to become warmer, wetter and experience a substantial increase in anthropogenic land-uses, such as increased urbanisation. In turn, the functional composition of the Norwegian flora is predicted to shift towards tall, woody, fast-growing species. © 2022 The Authors.

Monitoring programmes often use remote sensing data and focus on changes in land cover/land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. Although a wide range of indicators is in use, landscape aesthetics is a topic that is frequently neglected. Our aim was to determine whether aspects of landscape content and configuration could be used as surrogate measures for visual landscape quality in monitoring programmes based on remote sensing. In this paper, we test whether map-derived indicators of landscape structure from the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes are correlated with visual landscape preferences. Two groups of people participated: (1) locals and (2) non-local students. Using the total dataset, we found significant positive correlations between preferences and spatial metrics, including number of land types, number of patches and land type diversity. In addition, preference scores were high where water was present within the mapped image area, even if the water itself was not visible in the images. When the dataset was split into two groups, we found no significant correlation between the preference scores of the students and locals. Whilst the student group preferred images portraying diverse and heterogeneous landscapes, neither diversity nor heterogeneity was correlated with the preference scores of the locals. We conclude that certain indicators based on spatial structure also have relevance in relation to landscape preferences in agricultural landscapes. However, the finding that different groups of people prefer different types of landscape underlines the need for care when interpreting indicator values. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In Norway, forest expansion is a major trend, with an increase in volume of 20.3% during the period 1994-2008. The annual increase has more than doubled since 1967. This study was carried out to gain more insight into the complexity of vegetation dynamics and alterations in a lowland area on the coast of W Norway, and to identify the driving forces behind these changes. Field surveys were carried out with aerial photo interpretation and vegetation mapping. Spatial analysis was carried out using GIS. Historical sources were identified, interpreted, and used to generate information on land-use during recent centuries. Supplementary methods consisted of soil profile analysis and dendrochronology. Climate data were used to analyse climatic trends in the past 90 years since 1923. Forest expansion was a major trend during 1956-1994. In 1956, 49.5% of the area was covered by forest, and by 1994 the coverage had increased with 53.4%. Forestation continued during 1994-2003 and 2003-2007, but at rates far lower than in the previous period (4.0 and 3.8% increases, compared to 53.4%). Forest expansion was most extensive during 1956-1994, a period with no clear trend in mean July temperatures. A distinct increase in mean July temperatures occurred during the period 1994-2003 and again in 2003-2007, when the rate of forestation was far lower than in previous decades. This is an indication that a factor other than climate change is the most important driving force for vegetation change, forest expansion in particular. Forestation did not start simultaneously throughout all parts of the study area, but at different times on different landholdings. Forestation initially started on plots where livestock grazing first came to an end (in the 1930s), and lastly on plots where grazing came to an end three decades later, in the 1960s. The different starting times of forestation is reflected in the present age structure of the forest stands on the eight landholdings studied. The conclusion is drawn that changes in land-use are the major driving force behind the distinct process of forestation that occurred during the 20th century.","Vegetables","10.3112/erdkunde.2011.04.02","https://doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2011.04.02",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

Predator removal by culling or translocation is controversial, expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its effectiveness from all available evidence. We used explicit systematic review methodology to determine the impact of predator removal on four measurable responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching success and fledging success) and population size (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to summarize results from 83 predator removal studies from six continents. We also investigated whether characteristics of the prey, predator species, location, and study methodology explained heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators increased hatching success, fledging success, and breeding populations. Removing all predator species achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding population size was not improved on islands, or overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity in effect sizes for the four population parameters was not explained by whether predators were native or introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the difference was not significant. We conclude that current evidence indicates that predator removal is an effective strategy for the conservation of vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the ethical and practical problems associated with predator removal may lead managers to favor alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed to provide and synthesize data to determine whether these are effective management practices for future policies on bird conservation.","bird conservation and culling and evidence-based conservation and hatching success and meta-analysis and predator eradication and systematic review methodology and ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT and MESOPREDATOR RELEASE and MAMMALIAN PREDATORS and NEST PREDATION and METAANALYSIS and CONSERVATION and CONFLICTS and ISLANDS and ECOLOGY and SUCCESS","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01421.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01421.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.

However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.","SEA-LEVEL RISE and HURRICANE-KATRINA and VEGETATION BIOSHIELDS and MANAGED REALIGNMENT and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and MISSISSIPPI DELTA and ELEVATION and WETLANDS and EROSION and RESTORATION","10.1371/journal.pone.0027374     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027374",NA,NA,NA,"Coastal","Summarised evidence"

Even-aged forest management, in which old, semi-natural forests are converted to clear-cuts and culturally regenerated stands, is expected to have pronounced impact on the abundance and composition of this group of animals due to changes in the understory vegetation. During a 39 year-period we sampled autumn numbers of small mammals in uncut, semi-natural old forest and in recent clearcuts, supplemented by a 7-year sample from middle-aged plantations. Field voles Microtus agrestis were almost exclusively trapped in clearcuts. Bank voles Myodes glareolus dominated in the old forest, but reached equal or higher densities than field voles in clearcuts. Here, their combined abundance exceeded that of bank voles in old forest.

Cruise ships make landings all around the archipelago, and there are numerous snowmobile, boat and hiking excursions. We describe disturbance effects on the three geese species that breed in Svalbard: the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the light-bellied brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). All three are regarded as highly vulnerable to disturbance. Behavioural responses by geese to humans on foot were analysed by estimating the distances at which geese become alerted, the escape flight distances and the length of escape flights, during pre-nesting, nesting and brood-rearing periods. We evaluate the consequences of human intrusion on the reproductive success in breeding colonies. During all three phases, pink-footed geese responded at longer ranges, and flew/ran longer distances, than both brent and barnacle geese: when disturbed on the nest site, both male and female pink-footed geese flew far away, resulting in a high rate of nest loss to avian predators (35%), compared with the 4 and 0% losses among barnacle and brent geese, respectively. During brood rearing, families of pink-footed geese escaped at an average distance of 1717 m, compared with distances of 620 and 330 m for brent and barnacle geese, respectively. Even though bird sanctuaries have been established on several islets, with no human access during nesting, many core areas for the three species remain without restrictions, such as islets used by brent geese and slopes and valleys with nesting pink-footed geese, brood-rearing areas and moulting grounds for non-breeding geese. We propose regulations of human access to goose concentration areas, and address the need to better protect these significant areas. We also discuss the need for further research on the vulnerability of geese to human activity.","Barnacle goose and brent goose and disturbance impact and pink-footed goose and recreational activities and tourism and PINK-FOOTED GEESE and ANSER-BRACHYRHYNCHUS and BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES and BRANTA LEUCOPSIS and DIETARY OVERLAP and HABITAT USE and BARNACLE and EXPLOITATION and INCUBATION and SUCCESS and Social Control, Informal and Social Control, Formal","10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00120.x",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Polar ecosystems / arctic tundra","Observational studies"

Having major implications for the abilities of actors to pursue their interests in practical forest management, the methodologies of biodiversity mapping have been highly controversial and contested. We identify two different forest ontologies, or realities, that were enacted by the two main competing methodologies for such mapping. The methodologies, SiS and EiF, were supported by what we term the environmental and the forestry segments, respectively. Whereas a mapping approach associated with the environmental segment enacted a varied and complex forest ontology, a mapping approach related to the forestry segment enacted a comprehensible and more standardized forest ontology. In analyzing the two ontologies, we explore the links between the configuration of the mapping methodologies and 1) the forest realities they enact, 2) the scientific ideals they advocate, and 3) the relationship between mapping and management decisions. In particular, we argue that the ontologies have different political implications, generally favoring the actors that support them. On a more general level, we show that ontological politics is performed in the enactment of different ontologies related to different political segments, associated with different sectors. © 2022","Biodiversity mapping and Forest governance and Ontological politics and Norway and biodiversity and forest management and governance approach and habitat loss and mapping and politics and article and forest and forestry and ontology and Trees","10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.015","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.015",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest","Observational studies"

The collaboration within these governance networks can be formalized or informal, top-down or bottom-up, and designed or self-organized. Informal self-organized governance networks may increase legitimacy if a variety of stakeholders are involved, but at the same time, accountability becomes blurred when decisions are taken. Basically, democratic accountability refers to ways in which citizens can control their government and the mechanisms for doing so. Scholars in ecosystem management are generally positive to policy/governance networks and emphasize its potential for enhancing social learning, adaptability, and resilience in social-ecological systems. Political scientists, on the other hand, have emphasized the risk that the public interest may be threatened by governance networks. I describe and analyze the multilevel governance network of Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve (KVBR) in Southern Sweden, with the aim of understanding whether and how accountability is secured in the governance network and its relation to representative democracy. The analysis suggests that the governance network of KVBR complements representative democracy. It deals mainly with ""low politics""; the learning and policy directions are developed in the governance network, but the decisions are embedded in representative democratic structures. Because several organizations and agencies co-own the process and are committed to the outcomes, there is a shared or extended accountability. A recent large investment in KVBR caused a major crisis at the municipal level, fueled by the financial crisis. The higher levels of the governance network, however, served as a social memory and enhanced resilience of the present biosphere development trajectory. For self-organized networks, legitimacy is the bridge between adaptability and accountability; accountability is secured as long as the adaptive governance network performs well, i.e., is perceived as legitimate. Governing and ensuring accountability of governance networks, without hampering their flexibility, adaptability, and innovativeness, represents a new challenge for the modern state.","adaptive capacity and adaptive cycle and adaptive governance and bridging organizations and ecosystem service and informal institutions and leadership and naturum and panarchy and path dependency and ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT and KRISTIANSTADS-VATTENRIKE and WETLAND LANDSCAPE and RESILIENCE and CAPACITY and TRANSFORMATION",NA,"https://doi.org/NA",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Realising the role of river social-ecological systems in providing ecosystem services (ES) to society, we have made the first step, through a systematic review, to identify progress, gaps and future research directions for river restoration research across the globe. We systematically reviewed articles and summarised the trends of river restoration within the explicit context of ES assessment. The economic and ecological aspects of river restoration were the prime focus of major studies, whereas social benefits have been least addressed. The results identified the research gaps and future opportunities and tried to supplement those gaps by addressing the questions that need to be researched in future studies. The proposed conceptual framework is designed how application of ES perspective help to integrate social benefits in river restoration research.

There have been debates over the importance of WKHs in relation to the conservation of biodiversity in production forests. We applied a systematic review protocol and meta-analysis to summarize knowledge on comparisons of biodiversity qualities, such as dead wood and species richness, between WKHs and production forests in relevant countries. We also summarized the knowledge on the impact of edge effects by comparing WKHs surrounded by production forests to WKHs surrounded by clear cuts. Studies had been conducted in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on our meta-analysis, WKHs seem to be relative hotspots for dead wood volume, diversity of dead wood, number of species and number of red-listed species. There were some differences also between countries in these biodiversity qualities. Only two studies compared WKHs surrounded by production forests and clear cuts, respectively.

Therefore, and departing from an SRL, this paper aims to answer the main question about the sociodemographic elements that affect the SP related to protected areas. The results indicate that household income and education are linked to behaviors favoring conservation. Likewise, dissatisfaction regarding social well-being, access to natural resources and management generate behaviors that negatively affect the SP about the conservation role of protected areas.

Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat.","Beaver dams and fish migration and meta-analysis and public perception and salmon and species reintroduction and JUVENILE COHO SALMON and CUTTHROAT TROUT and ATLANTIC SALMON and BROOK TROUT and ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH and HABITAT USE and CASTOR-CANADENSIS and RIVER DRAINAGE and POPULATION-STRUCTURE and NATIONAL-PARK","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes, Wetlands/peatlands","Summarised evidence"

We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation.

Although numerous case studies have identified negative ecological impacts of changes in different aspects of flow regimes (e.g. magnitude, timing), there have been few attempts to systematically review this literature to derive general relationships regarding ecological responses to changes in flow regimes. Systematic literature reviews can inform science and management in ecologically complex systems not amenable to experimentation. However, such analysis of existing literature is often limited by inconsistent study design and data reporting. To attempt to overcome these difficulties, we used the recently developed Eco Evidence method and software to analyse 165 studies of ecological responses to changes in river flow regimes. Eco Evidence provides a rule set and standardised list of terms to assist reviewers to interpret consistently the results of disparate studies. The companion software assists with the synthesis of this information to reach transparent and repeatable conclusions regarding cause-effect hypotheses of ecological responses to environmental drivers. We compared our results to those of a recent, informal systematic review of the same studies, which is proving extremely influential. Stronger conclusions are reached when evidence is weighted, classified and combined according to the rules in Eco Evidence. Compared to the original review, we reached informative conclusions for a larger number of flow-response hypotheses, found that hypotheses for which the most evidence was available returned inconsistent results, addressed hypotheses at levels of conceptual resolution relevant to management and identified where insufficient evidence exists to reach a conclusion. Analyses conducted at several levels of conceptual resolution found strong support for many hypotheses regarding ecological impacts. We found a consistent sensitivity to changes in flow regime for both fish and riparian vegetation across a variety of performance metrics. While macroinvertebrate responses varied among performance metrics (e.g. abundance was negatively affected by increases or decreases in flows, diversity was only negatively affected by flow decreases, and assemblage structure was affected by neither), they were largely consistent within these metrics. We thus conclude that the Eco Evidence approach allowed us to extract more knowledge from the data set than was possible in the original review. Eco Evidence can improve synthesis of the burgeoning ecological literature and improve our general understanding in ecology. Amid widespread calls for evidence-based' environmental management, this powerful tool provides managers with a means of using research to help inform complex environmental decision-making.","Eco Evidence and ecological response and flow alteration and literature analysis and systematic review and ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and BIODIVERSITY and SCIENCE and OPPORTUNITIES and ASSOCIATION and CHALLENGES and REGIMES","10.1111/fwb.12234     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12234",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A meta-analysis","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","Industrial forestry typically leads to a simplified forest structure and altered species composition. Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25years ago to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and temperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no comprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well as un-harvested forests. Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78 studies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-harvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least in the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna. Retention cuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as higher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species taken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist species and unclassified species), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts. Retention cuts had negative impacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior species may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some open-habitat species compared with clearcuts. Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of forest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were not enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on biodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on either forest species or open-habitat species, although limited data may have hindered our capacity to identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic groups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for integrating biodiversity conservation and production forestry, although identifying optimal solutions between these two goals may need further attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will not substitute for conservation actions targeting certain highly specialized species associated with forest-interior or open-habitat conditions.","biodiversity and boreal forest and clearcut and disturbance and forestry and structural retention and temperate forest and variable retention and GREEN-TREE RETENTION and PUBLICATION BIAS and USNEA-LONGISSIMA and DEAD-WOOD and HABITAT and RESPONSES and HARVESTS and FILL and TRIM and CUT","10.1111/1365-2664.12289     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12289",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

Butterflies are a popular target group for fragmentation studies and represent an ideal assemblage to explore the impact and role of the matrix in patchy landscapes. To date, there has been no attempt to synthesise available research and assess the extent to which the matrix is included in studies of fragmented butterfly populations. Addressing this issue is important for improved understanding of habitat use in fragmented landscapes, and for the successful management and conservation of butterfly biodiversity. Our systematic review of 100 empirical research papers spans 50 years, and identifies how (and indeed if) the matrix is recognised in studies of butterfly populations in fragmented landscapes. We found that it was significantly more likely for studies not to include the matrix in their experimental design. This is of particular concern given 60 % of papers that excluded the matrix in their research did so in systems where the matrix was expected to contain resources of value for patch-associated species (as it was either a heterogeneous landscape or had similar structure to patches). Of the papers that did consider the matrix, 80 % (n = 24) reported a negative effect of the matrix on butterfly species and/or communities. Matrix effects may influence the survival and persistence of faunal groups in a world increasingly dominated by fragmented habitats.

Here, we conduct a systematic review of empirical sustainability assessments to quantify the use of sustainability indicators in the scientific literature and highlight associations between analytical methods and their outcomes. We find that indicator type, continent of study, species body mass, taxonomic group and socio-economic status of study site are important predictors of the probability of reported sustainability. The most common measures of sustainability include population growth models, the Robinson & Redford (1991) model and population trends through time. Indicators relying on population-specific biological data are most often used in North America and Europe, while cruder estimates are more often used in Africa, Latin America and Oceania.

However, not all land use is equal, and many traditional land uses, and emergent cultural landscapes support important biodiversity and provide multiple benefits to society. Despite their importance, cultural landscapes are threatened by several factors, the most prominent being abandonment of the traditional practices that maintain them. Afforestation schemes to mitigate atmospheric carbon are an additional emerging threat. Abandonment and afforestation threaten both ecological processes and socio-cultural values, but surprisingly, there is little knowledge on the concurrent social and ecological impacts. We used a multi-method approach of ecological field surveys to quantify the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services (ES) in four different vegetation types representing managed open vegetation, natural forest types for abandonment and planted forests to represent afforestation. We explored the match and/or mismatch between socio-cultural values and biophysical supply of ES in those vegetation types and investigated the socio-demographic factors that influence socio-cultural values for ES. Biophysical supply of ES was variable across vegetation types and synergies were as common as trade-offs. Socio-cultural values were high for most ES in open vegetation and natural forests and low for planted forests. Biophysical supply and socio-cultural values were well matched across the vegetation types for biodiversity and agricultural products, but strongly mismatched for climate regulation. We show that although trade-offs occur both within value- and between value domains, synergies are also common. Our results show that abandonment would impact on the biophysical supply and socio-cultural values of some ES but that this impact would be lower than that of afforestation. We argue that our approach can be used to manage trade-offs and enhance synergies between value domains for a holistic approach to landscape stewardship that supports both people and nature.",NA,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106967","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106967",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, semi-natural heathlands","Quasi-observational studies"

We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model.

The common pool resource character of this situation has made it difficult to find ways to resolve conflicts that could threaten the two sectors' continued co-existence. A consultation procedure that was introduced to reduce conflicts does not appear to be effective, since conflicts between the two actors still occur. One reason for this failure might be found in the power distribution between forestry and reindeer herding. Earlier research has shown that a co-management system in which the allocation of power between the stakeholders is uneven is difficult to maintain in the long term. However, it is unclear just how uneven the power distribution is between the two actors in this case, and the consequences the disparity might have for the viability and stability of the management system. Focusing on the power relations within the consultation procedures, this paper explores the potential of the present institutional system to take the different interests of the stakeholders into account and to use the consultation procedures as tools for co-managing the forest resources in northern Sweden.

Supporting ES were considered only in relation to biodiversity, especially species and habitats linked to old oaks.

The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a 'boundary object'; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act as a helpful 'centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.","Anthropocene and Environmental ethics and Human-nature relations and Literature review and Natural resource management and ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and AGRICULTURAL STEWARDSHIP and EARTH STEWARDSHIP and CLIMATE-CHANGE and UNITED-STATES and MANAGEMENT and CONSERVATION and CERTIFICATION and GOVERNANCE","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.005     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.005",NA,NA,"Not relevant",NA,"Summarised evidence"

In the Swedish national forest policy, the equal goals of timber production and biodiversity conservation have increased the responsibility of landowners and managers to modify practical management. We compiled written information from three larger FSC-certified forestry companies combined with semi-structured interviews with forest management personnel at regional offices to map what data and information the companies collect and use. We examined to what extent obtainable information from the forest companies captures composition, structure, and function of boreal ecosystems at patch, stand and landscape scale. This was done using 47 indicators compiled from literature and grouped into five categories based on nationally identified deficiencies in the managed boreal forest compared to unmanaged forest. We found that the recording of data describing different aspects of the forest ecosystem were separated in two largely uncoordinated systems, Ecological Landscape Plans and stand registers. While there is a need for conservation-oriented data across scales, collected statistics was largely production-oriented and related to the stand scale. We also identified information gaps regarding different ecosystem structures and their spatial distribution such as dead wood and habitat networks. The knowledge base available to future management decisions also seems to lack information on connectivity in the landscape, habitat at smaller spatial scales and the effectiveness of reserved areas. To reach the ecological goals of sustainable forest management, there is a need to further coordinate existing data and information but also to fill gaps in particular regarding cross-scale information.

In Fennoscandia, there is a long tradition of silvicultural burnings to enhance tree regeneration. Recently, prescribed burnings have been modified for biodiversity goals following the recommendations that have emerged from ecological research. Prominent biodiversity gains can be obtained by combining sufficient retention levels with burnings. Consequently, burning and retention have been recommended by recent national red-list assessments, strategies, and forest-management guidelines, and they have been adopted in forest-certification standards in Finland. Contrary to these recommendations, the opposite development has taken place: (1) the ecological efficiency of the criterion concerning prescribed burning in the PEFC forest-certification standard has been impaired, (2) state funding to encourage private forest owners to apply prescribed burning was reduced significantly, and (3) prescribed burnings have been abandoned altogether in commercial state-owned forests. Traditional burnings with variable retention have also been partially replaced with burning of small retention-tree groups. This new method is less risky and cheaper, but its ecological benefits are questionable because small-sized fires produce much smaller areas of burned forest soil with less fire-affected wood than traditional silvicultural burnings. Generally, the widely accepted goal to increase burnings with retention appears difficult to achieve and would require stronger political will and economic support from the government. We identified several actions that could improve the weakened situation of fire-dependent biodiversity and recommend the following: (1) setting a clear goal and ensuring sufficient funding for the burnings—including restoration burnings in conservation areas—and targeting these to specific fire-continuum areas with sufficient retention to ensure the continuity of fire-affected habitats at landscape level; (2) renewing the current subsidizing policies to encourage private landowners to perform prescribed burnings in regeneration areas after final fellings, and to safeguard accidental forest-fire areas as set-asides; (3) renewing the current prescribed-burning criterion of the Finnish PEFC forest-certification standard with more ambitious ecological goals; and (4) re-introducing prescribed burnings in commercial state forests where management targets are under political steering. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biodiversity and Conservation areas and Fire-dependent species and Forest certification and Red-listed species and Restoration burnings and Fennoscandia and Finland and Deforestation and Ecosystems and Fires and Reforestation and Restoration and Soils and Ecological efficiency and Forest Certification and Forest certification standards and Forest management guidelines and Private forest owners and Variable retentions and biodiversity and certification and forest dynamics and forest fire and forest management and prescribed burning and protected area and Red List and restoration ecology and silviculture and Conservation and Burns","10.1186/s13717-019-0207-3","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-019-0207-3",25.657384334547,65.0157895974991,"Finland",NA,NA

Identifying landscape features and land use contexts that facilitate CES delivery is critical for guiding urban greenspace management. However, how landscape features and urban context interact with each other in influencing the CES of greenspaces remains unclear. Studies on the CES of patchy urban forests are needed as they are essential urban CES providers, but vulnerable under urban land use pressure. To address these concerns, we compared the CES of 20 urban forest patches in Helsinki, Finland, with five different combinations of landscape features (i.e. size and connectivity) and land use contexts (i.e. surrounding construction density). CES were assessed through an on-site survey on visitors' use, perceptions of CES experience and overall satisfaction, to capture the possible disparities among CES measurements. In larger (>20 ha) forests, visitors were highly satisfied with CES, particularly appreciating the experience of physical health improvement and inspiration through longer and more intense physical uses. Visitors of urban forests in a low construction density context appreciated experiences of cultural heritage, psychological restoration and physical health improvement. Urban forests deliver unique CES characterised by physical use and the benefit of restoration, aesthetics and contact with nature. We suggest that maintaining large urban forests is more effective in promoting CES in high-density areas. In low-density areas, maintaining small forests with open greenspace in the surroundings can also promote CES experiences. We identify management gaps caused by a mismatch between use intensity and CES experiences of urban forests, while both are important in determining people's overall satisfaction.

It is important for management of the areas, statutory wilderness areas and the other wilderness-like areas to determine what are the features that make an area wilderness, how these areas are used and appreciated by Finnish people. Questionnaires and landscape rankings were used to determine that. Old virgin forests and open bogs are the most important features of Finnish wilderness as revealed by the mental images of Finnish people. In addition, wilderness areas have to be vast, roadless, remote, peaceful, silent and at least near their natural condition. Ponds, streams, wooden trails across bogs and old cabins for common use are consistent with the idea of Finnish wilderness.

It is partly autobiographical in the sense that it concerns forest issues that 1, for various reasons, have been entangled with recently. These are the making of carbon (REDD+) forests in Northeast India, preservation of the urban forests and planting of indigenous trees in Karura forests in Nairobi, Kenya, and the transformation of Swedish forests into vast industrial plantations. I come to these issues with little knowledge about the forest ecology or the flora and fauna, as such, but rather as a scholar with earlier experience of analysis of the social and political dynamics involved in conflicts over forests, that is, how differently powered actors seek to appropriate, stake claims to or control the forest. Hence, my point of departure and analytical framework is largely that of political ecology. In a conversation about the work of the anthropologist Brian Morris, I will point to the thinness of such an approach and open up aspects that are critical to Morris' way of engaging with the interactions of people, plants, insects, and animals. This, I will argue, is a truly grounded environmental anthropology.","Brian Morris and forest conservation and political ecology and indigenous environmental knowledge and indigenous trees and invasive species and industrial forest management and India and Kenya and Sweden and AFRICA and LAND","10.4103/0972-4923.197611     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.197611",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

With significant loss of wetland areas due to expansion of forest, agriculture, and energy production industries, some countries, including Sweden, have begun providing economic support for environmental objectives for wetland conservation and restoration. Targeting such objectives and setting up relevant plans can decrease the risk of losing valuable wetland-related benefits and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Different ranges of wetland ecosystem services are broadly addressed by the SDGs, however, target-based assessments are required to better understand wetland functionality for sustainable development. This study investigates whether and how wetland ecosystems at local and regional scales can contribute to achieving the SDGs and their targets in Sweden. Scientific literature, policy documents, and international reports on Swedish wetland ecosystems are scrutinized to exemplify the SDGs and their targets, applying a scoring framework based on their interactions. This reveals that, overall, Swedish wetland ecosystems and implemented management plans can positively interact with 10 SDGs and 17 targets at different levels. The analysis also highlights synergies that need to be considered for integrated environmental governance and enhanced policy coherence for Swedish wetland management.","ecosystem services and nature-based solutions and policy coherence and scoring approach and sustainable development goals and wetland and MANAGEMENT and GOVERNANCE and CARBON","10.3390/w11030609     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.3390/w11030609",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Because success depends upon the support of communities, engaging with the cultural values held by local people is critical to the restoration process. Cultural values are closely held beliefs about what is important to local communities, grounded in historical and contemporary cultural relationships with ecosystems. To address to what extent restoration projects in the peer-reviewed literature consider cultural values, we conducted a systematic review covering 1994–2021, resulting in a sample of 56 articles. From our review, we found that restoration projects include data on cultural values collected mostly through qualitative approaches. Concepts from cultural analysis, ecosystem services, and traditional ecological knowledge are commonly used to frame cultural values in restoration. Drawing on our results, we suggest a standardized process and set of best practices for practitioners and researchers incorporating cultural values into their restoration projects. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural frameworks and cultural values and ecological restoration and restoration and traditional knowledge and culture and ecosystem service and human activity and restoration ecology","10.1080/08941920.2022.2073625","https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2022.2073625",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Coastal, Rivers & lakes, Forest, Urban ecosystems, wetlands","Summarised evidence"

This requires a transition from traditional sectoral planning to more open, multi-stakeholder approaches that take into account all dimensions of sustainability across entire landscapes and even regions. Comparisons of regions with different landscape histories and governance legacies can support collaborative learning. Following Patsy Healy's and Frances Cleaver's approaches, we compare institutional strategies and constraints for collaborative territorial planning in Canada and Sweden by focusing on two case study regions in steep urban-rural gradients. Both regions are facing severe challenges after a long focus on forest staples resources. To cope with the transition towards multiple objectives, efforts towards collaborative learning inspired by the Model Forest landscape approach were made. The Canadian case study had some quick successes because of government funding, and managed to begin collaborative planning, but changes in public policy led to a quick demise. The Swedish case study developed local islands of collaborative learning, provided that champions managed to sustain their work. To conclude, we see two trajectories towards collaborative territorial planning shaped by different institutions: (1) regional level public core funding that can support planning processes top-down, or (2) establishment of voluntary local win-win solutions bottom-up. Both require committed stakeholders that are willing to employ a holistic perspective, and able to sustain resources in the long-term. However, despite a clearly stated goal towards multiple-use forest management, institutional legacies aiming at supporting maximum sustained yield wood production that have ruled the relationships between the state and the industry for so many years remain key barriers for multifunctional landscapes and regions.","Regional planning and Forest and Institutions and Collaboration and Landscape approach and Bergslagen and Hautes Laurentides and Model forest and Forest-dependent region and GOVERNANCE and MANAGEMENT and PERSPECTIVE and CONSENSUS and GRADIENT and Trees","10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.015     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.02.015",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA
"623","rayyan-674236976","The influence of human values on attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation","Journal of Environmental Management","Human attitudes and behaviours have been linked to the degradation of global biodiversity, particularly forest ecosystems. Indeed, effective conservation actions require that the attitudes and behaviours of affected individuals and communities are taken into account. While several studies have examined how human attitudes and behaviours affect conservation, it is still unclear which, and how, human value orientations influence conservation attitudes and behaviour. This is critical because attitudes and behaviours are underpinned by the complex concept of human values. Thus, effective management and conservation of environmental resources requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of these values, and how they affect attitudinal and behavioural preferences towards the natural environment and their protection. Here we review the human value orientations influencing people's attitudes and behaviours towards forest conservation, and discuss how conservation projects can be more successful by aligning their goals and operations to people's values. To do this, we carried out a scoping review, using the sub-Saharan Africa region as a case study, and followed the PRISMA-ScR systematic review guidelines. A narrative synthesis was adopted for data analysis. We identified different value types that fall within three broad human value orientation domains influencing forest conservation attitudes and behaviours. Anthropocentric and relational value orientations emerged as most dominant, with both positive and negative influences on a number of forest conservation attitudes and behaviours, albeit with more evidence for positive influence. The positive attitudes and behaviours were linked to utilitarian motivations and cultural beliefs and include rural support for conservation, compliance to forest rules, sustainable forest use, and participation in forest management. The values linked to dependence on forest resources, low benefits from conservation, and conservation costs, tend to trigger negative conservation attitudes and behaviours. To effectively achieve forest conservation goals, environmental managers, conservationists, and decision-makers should understand the extent and directional influence of value orientations on conservation attitudes and behaviours. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocentric values and Forest values and Relational values and Scoping review and Sub-Saharan Africa and Attitude and Biodiversity and Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem and Forests and Humans and biodiversity and conservation management and conservation status and environmental protection and farmers attitude and forest ecosystem and forest management and public attitude and Africa south of the Sahara and data analysis and human and manager and motivation and narrative and practice guideline and review and synthesis and systematic review and attitude and ecosystem and forest","10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112857","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112857",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Forest","Summarised evidence"

Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly used in policymaking to promote biodiversity and enhance ecosystem services through the protection, creation, restoration and connection of natural and man -made green areas.2. The EU Commission adopted in 2013, the concept as a strategy. When member states apply the policy, it is translated into specific bureaucratic and political systems, creating different ""policy assemblages' of ideas and institutional features.3. We analyse the Swedish GI policy to draw conclusions about how it has been assembled in one particular member state and what that particular assemblage will imply for biodiversity conservation. In combination with understanding policies as assemblages, we use the ""What's the problem represented to be'-approach as method.4. We show that the Swedish GI policy assemblage consists of a mix of policy ideas developed in Sweden and the EU. Despite the current strong focus on biodiversity conservation, the notion of land's multifunctionality, characterizing the EU strategy and the possibility to conserve biodiversity on land used for purposes other than conservation increasingly influence the Swedish policy as it is formed.5. Although the policy has the potential to mainstream biodiversity conservation measures across different sectors, based on our analysis of current discourse, its implementation will likely promote GI measures less disruptive to existing land use activities, making its capacity to halt biodiversity loss marginal.","biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services and environmental governance and EU and multifunctional landscapes and policy assemblage and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and FRAMEWORK and GOVERNANCE","10.1002/pan3.10456","https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10456",17.062431988005,62.7342098610845,"Sweden",NA,NA

Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency, as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often referred to as Europes last wilderness, even if human influence of varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia.

Others, such as recreational, aesthetic, cultural and existence values of a well-preserved river flows are less studied. There is an increasing interest of policy makers to understand the benefits of costly river ecosystem restoration measures. Moreover, disregarding such benefits may turn into inter-stakeholder conflicts. This paper reviews empirically-based literature assessing environmental flows restoration/conservation. Thus, it offers the state-of-the-art on three aspects: 1) what motivations drive the socioeconomic evaluation of instream flows (policies and alternative instream flow regimes); 2) what values and benefits are associated with instream flows (e.g. the sheer existence of a well-preserved river, productive assets and cultural attributes); and 3) what methods are employed to undertake such assessments (e.g. scenario development, monetary and non-monetary valuations, and stakeholders engagement). Building on this, we propose a methodological framework for case-specific assessments of the restoration of environmental flows. This proposal combines increased stakeholder participation, better understanding of ecosystem functioning, awareness of the plurality of values and an accurate choice of valuation methods.

This short-term study compared management effects on road verge and pasture vegetation in western Norway. We quantified vegetation change and explored whether it occurred along underlying environmental gradients. We found management-related variation in species richness and vegetation physiognomy, but high resistance in species composition prevented directional changes in vegetation dynamics. Initial differences between the habitats indicated historical management effects on traditionally managed pastures and road verges. Given proper management, road verges may have a nature conservation potential.

Therefore, these areas must be managed to maximize biodiversity and density of pollinating insects. We used DNA metabarcoding to study honeybee pollen resource use over time and space in the city of Oslo, Norway, and to assess the role of green infrastructure as a resource for pollinators and the services they generate. Urban honeybees used diverse pollen resources throughout their active season. There was considerable seasonal turnover in pollen resource use that reflected flowering phenology. Non-native plants (including invasive species) were an important resource early in the season but were replaced by native plants later in the season. Hive location was not strongly correlated with resource use, likely indicating effective long-distance foraging in the fragmented urban landscape. However, flower visitation rates and floral resource density in public urban green spaces were coupled to pollen use. Honeybees collected pollen from a small number of preferred species but also visited other species, likely for nectar. To preserve pollinator services, urban planning should consider flower resource management, with particular focus on planting native species that can act as early season resources for bees. Public campaigns and other incentive mechanisms to promote the cultivation of native plants that are resources for pollinators and the protection of urban semi-natural habitats have the potential to enhance the value of green infrastructure to support urban pollinators and pollination services. © 2023, The Author(s).","Citizen science and Flower resources and Pollen diversity and Pollination and Seasonality and Urban ecology and Urban green infrastructure and Seasons and Pollen","10.1007/s11252-023-01458-1","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-023-01458-1",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Urban ecosystems","Observational studies"

Trade in soybean has been promoted by national and international agencies to stimulate economic development in low- and middle-income countries. Trade in soybean has generated an increase in GDP and average income in producing countries, but soybean production is also linked to negative effects on the well-being of local populations, such as land appropriation and increased social conflicts among communities. In addition, soybean production is linked to extensive deforestation and clearance of natural vegetation as well as water pollution due to intensive agricultural practices, which in turn has negative impacts on human well-being. As such, more information is needed to understand the range of negative and positive impacts of soybean production on people and the environment. This study presents a systematic literature review of the direct and indirect social-economic impacts of soybean agricultural production for trade. We employ the concept of multi-dimensional well-being to classify the various direct social impacts that have been found in the literature and the concept of ecosystem services to classify indirect social impacts, as the contribution of natural ecosystems to human well-being. The main finding of the review is that the empirical evidence for direct social impacts of soy production is scarce and mixed in terms of direction of impact. More tangible dimensions such as income, nutrition and living standards are more often positively impacted by soy trade, while more intangible dimensions such as freedom of choice and cultural value are found to be negatively affected. The empirical evidence for impacts on ecosystem services is more comprehensive and shows a clear picture of negative impacts associated with soybean production due to land use changes and deforestation, and agricultural intensification. There is hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of sustainable value chain policies. © 2021","Economic and social effects and Ecosystems and International trade and Land use and Water pollution and Agricultural expansion and Agricultural intensification and Economic development and Ecosystem services and Multi dimensional and Social impact and South America and Soybean production and Systematic Review and Well being and Deforestation","10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130182","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130182",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A review","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations.

Despite widespread recognition that habitat fragmentation can influence food web interactions, consensus on the factors underlying variation in the impacts of fragmentation across systems remains elusive. In this study, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation and spatial habitat structure on resource consumption in terrestrial arthropod food webs. Across 419 studies, we found a negative overall effect of fragmentation on resource consumption. Variation in effect size was extensive but predictable. Specifically, resource consumption was reduced on small, isolated habitat fragments, higher at patch edges, and neutral with respect to landscape-scale spatial variables. In general, resource consumption increased in fragmented settings for habitat generalist consumers but decreased for specialist consumers. Our study demonstrates widespread disruption of trophic interactions in fragmented habitats and describes variation among studies that is largely predictable based on the ecological traits of the interacting species. We highlight future prospects for understanding how changes in spatial habitat structure may influence trophic modules and food webs.","Connectivity and edge effects and effect size and habitat fragmentation and herbivory and meta-analysis and parasitism and patch size and resource consumption and PLANT-POPULATION SIZE and SPECIALIZED HERBIVORE and SPECIES INTERACTIONS and AREA RELATIONSHIPS and CROP POLLINATION and PATCH SIZE and FOOD WEBS and LANDSCAPE and RESPONSES and DIVERSITY","10.1111/ele.12305     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12305",NA,NA,NA,"Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems, Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 +/- 7.8% and +25.7 +/- 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 +/- 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 +/- 4.3% and -11.4 +/- 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further longterm data sets are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats - notably woodland - was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.","barrier effect and bats and habitat fragmentation and meta-analysis and roads and FORAGING BATS and BROWN BATS and CASUALTIES and JUVENILE and SIZE","10.1111/mam.12072     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/mam.12072",NA,NA,NA,"multiple (roads)","Summarised evidence"
"640","rayyan-674261558","How are biodiversity and dispersal of species affected by the management of roadsides? A systematic map","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity. Methods: This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website. Results: Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively. Conclusions: This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.","Road ecology and Roadside management and Biodiversity and Species dispersal and Semi-natural grasslands and Linear landscape elements and Refugia and ROAD VERGES and RAILWAY VERGES and PLANT and HABITAT and VEGETATION and LANDSCAPE and CORRIDORS and FRAGMENTATION and CONSERVATION and COMMUNITIES","10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1",NA,NA,NA,"roadside","Summarised evidence"

Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.","conservation and effect size and grassland and grouse and Hedges' g and herbivory and GREATER SAGE-GROUSE and BREEDING SUCCESS and BLACK GROUSE and LAND-USE and MANAGEMENT and WILDLIFE and IMPACTS and CATTLE","10.1002/ece3.3287     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3287",NA,NA,NA,"Mountains","Summarised evidence"

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.","Land use conflicts and Bioenergy buffers and Energy crops and Impact matrix and Ecosystem services and Miscanthus and Switchgrass and Willow and Poplar and Biomass supply chain and SHORT-ROTATION COPPICE and MISCANTHUS X GIGANTEUS and LAND-USE CHANGE and SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION and ENERGY CROPPING SYSTEMS and POPLAR RIPARIAN BUFFERS and GREENHOUSE-GAS BALANCE and SHALLOW GROUND-WATER and NITROGEN REMOVAL and NUTRIENT REMOVAL","10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.052     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.052",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Although wild and managed bees are increasingly threatened by the degradation of natural habitats and climate change, risking plant biodiversity and agriculture production, no study has yet performed a systematic review of heritability estimates across the group. Here we help fill this knowledge gap, gathering all available heritability estimates for ants, bees, and wasps, evaluating which factors affect these estimates and assessing the reported genetic correlations between traits. Using a model selection approach to analyze a dataset of more than 800 heritability estimates, we found that heritability is influenced by trait type, with morphological traits exhibiting the highest heritability estimates, and defense and metabolism-related traits showing the lowest estimates. Study system, sociality degree, experimental design, estimation type (narrow or broad-sense heritability), and sample size were not found to affect heritability estimates. Results remained unaltered when correcting for phylogenetic inertia, and when analyzing social bees separately. Genetic correlations between honeybee traits revealed both positive coefficients, usually for traits in the same category, and negative coefficients, suggesting trade-offs among other traits. We discuss these findings and highlight the importance of maintaining genetic variance in fitness-related traits. Our study shows the importance of considering heritability estimates and genetic correlations when designing breeding and conservation programs. We hope this meta-analysis helps identify sustainable breeding approaches and conservation strategies that help safeguard the evolutionary potential of wild and managed bees.","Bee breeding and Conservation and Genetic correlations and Heritability and Hymenoptera and APIS-MELLIFERA and HONEY-BEES and NATURAL-SELECTION and BODY-SIZE and HERITABILITY and HYMENOPTERA and CHARACTERS and APIDAE and PHYLOGENY and BEHAVIOR","10.1007/s10592-016-0904-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0904-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Debate over the relative effectiveness of different property rights regimes in reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the links between property rights regimes and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence from the past two decades on the environmental impacts of property rights regimes in fisheries, forests and range-lands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and community property regimes, as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive, negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influence effect of property rights regimes on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three languages, resulting in a total of 34,984 screened titles. Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 property regime studies: 55% of the studies related to forestry, 31% to fisheries, and 14% to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case-control studies but presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. We found that property regime comparisons differed across resource domains with, for example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmental outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pressure, and the presence or absence of clear, stable and legitimate rights (i.e. 'positive regime characteristics'). Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclusions about the environmental impacts of different property rights regimes within or across resource systems. The majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on property rights regimes would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe property rights regime characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes.","Environmental governance and Environmental impacts and Fisheries and Forests and Rangelands and Natural resources management and Property rights and Tenure and MARINE PROTECTED AREAS and SOLOMON-ISLANDS and SOUTH-AFRICA and REEF FISHES and COMMUNITY and MANAGEMENT and TENURE and CONSERVATION and DEGRADATION and RESILIENCE","10.1186/s13750-017-0090-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-017-0090-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on a systematic literature review, this paper summarizes the empirical evidence on how different ethno-cultural groups use, perceive, prefer, and assign meaning to urban nature. I use the urban forest, defined here as all the trees in a city, as a proxy to understand this process. The 31 studies reviewed here differ widely in their lines of inquiry, research methods, urban natural setting, and conceptualizations of ethno-cultural identity. Most studies take place in the US and Europe, where the most common definition of an ethno-culturally diverse group is a person of non-European/non-White background. Most studies focus on what these groups like about a particular urban natural setting, such as an urban park; and whether they like more or less trees in a specific context (e.g. urban park). These groups usually prefer passive and social uses of urban natural areas, and more manicured/functional natural landscapes with less trees. The most common meanings associated with urban natural settings dominated by trees are social interaction and integration. The most common explanations on why these differences occur involve theories on socio-economic marginality, collectivist vs. individualist cultures, urban vs. rural lifestyles, and landscapes of origin. Future research on the topic will benefit by differentiating race from ethnicity, capturing intra-ethnic variation, capturing immigrant identities, exploring the different social, cultural, and economic factors that influence values and/or preferences, and focusing on concrete aspects of urban nature, such as urban forests.","Ethnicity and Ecosystem governance and Migration and Multiculturalism and Urban planning and Urban forestry and GREEN SPACE and OUTDOOR RECREATION and NATURE EXPERIENCE and TREE SURVIVAL and ETHNICITY and PARKS and PARTICIPATION and COMMUNITY and LEISURE and RACE","10.1016/j.ufug.2017.06.006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2017.06.006",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion. Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested. Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old).

Despite its broad application, there is little evidence of its effect on biodiversity. To address this important knowledge gap, here we conducted a systematic review and a hierarchical meta-analysis of the effects of FSC on biodiversity worldwide. Our review yielded 57 studies spanning 2004–2022. Most studies were in the Americas and Europe (31 % and 28 %, respectively), and largely focused on vascular plants (41 %). Half (51 %) of the studies aimed to determine the effect of FSC certification on biodiversity. There were 15 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, resulting in 231 effect sizes for mammal, bird, and vascular plant abundance and 10 for vascular plant richness. Overall, there is a neutral effect of certification on taxa abundance, with only a positive effect on mammal assemblages. Responses varied considerably between mammals' traits. Threatened species, individuals with reduced body weight, and omnivorous species benefit from management under the FSC scheme. Vascular plant richness exhibited significantly higher values in FSC-certified areas. Moreover, the abundance of vascular plants also differs among traits, with shrubs and adult trees benefiting from FSC certification. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in biodiversity responses to FSC, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. The overall neutral effect and the divergent responses of taxa and species traits suggest that taxa/species-specific management and improvement of FSC criteria are required. © 2023","Biodiversity conservation and Forest certification and Forest stewardship council and Meta-analysis and Review and Animals and Biodiversity and Certification and Conservation of Natural Resources and Forests and Humans and Mammals and Trees and Conservation and Forestry and Forest Certification and Forest certification schemes and Forest stewardship councils and FSC certification and Knowledge gaps and Systematic Review and Vascular plant and Vascular plant richness and biodiversity and certification and forest management and literature review and meta-analysis and species diversity and species richness and adult tree and bird and body weight and conservation biology and effect size and endangered species and Europe and forest and knowledge gap and meta analysis and nonhuman and omnivore and pharmacology and review and shrub and systematic review and therapy and vascular plant and Western Hemisphere and animal and environmental protection and human and mammal and tree","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168296","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168296",NA,NA,NA,"Forest","Summarised evidence"

The results showed an increase in the number of works between 2012 and 2023, and they were especially conducted in Europe and Asia and less in North America, South America, and Oceania. Most studies were developed in terrestrial areas, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified them into types II and IV. Most of the works followed the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classification and were mainly focused on the supply dimension. Regulating and maintenance and cultural ES were the most mapped dimensions in PAs. The most frequent provisioning ES mapped in PAs were Animals reared for nutritional purposes and Cultivated terrestrial plants grown for nutritional purposes. In regulating and maintenance, Maintaining nursery populations and habitats and Regulation of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans were the most analysed. For cultural ES, Characteristics of living systems that enable activities promoting health, recuperation, or enjoyment through active or immersive interactions and Characteristics of living systems that enable aesthetic experiences were the most mapped ES in PAs. Most works followed a quantitative approach, although the number of qualitative studies is high. Finally, most of the works needed to be validated, which may hamper the credibility of mapping ES in PAs.

"651","rayyan-674230139","Pollinators enhance the production of a superior strawberry – A global review and meta-analysis","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Strawberry (Fragaria x ananasa Duch.) is the most economically important soft fruit worldwide. While self- and wind-pollination is possible for strawberry, without biotic pollination (animal pollinators, including artificial pollination by humans) rate of strawberry flowers rarely exceeds 60% and thus fruit production is decreased. At a time of widely recognized decline of pollinators and increasing global demand for balanced food, we need a comprehensive understanding of the worldwide valuation of these ecosystem services. In this paper, we use a transparent and systematic review process to detect gaps in the available literature. By applying multilevel meta-analytic models, we quantified the contribution of biotic pollinators and different pollinator types to strawberry fruits. Our review showed that research on strawberry pollination is clearly concentrated in European countries, with limited information for Asia – the largest strawberry producer. Additionally, we detected disproportions across research topics, stressing the need for further research on pollinator preferences between strawberry cultivars and the occurrence of managed and wild bee communities. The overall estimate of pollination benefit to strawberry crops is on average a 25% reduction in fruit weight for plants not receiving a biotic pollination treatment. This benefit is similar regardless of the pollinating species. The mean amount globally (2011–2020) receivable by producers from purchasers due to biotic pollination is $5.36 billion per year. Moreover, we demonstrated that strawberry plants that are dependent on self- or wind-pollination set on average 43% fewer seeds (fertilized achenes) than biotically pollinated plants. Such a huge reduction in seed set can cause fruit deformation and reduce the commercial value of strawberries. Together, these findings indicate the critical role of biotic pollination in strawberry production and quality. To ensure pollination services in strawberry farms and produce the best-quality fruits, growers should take action to sustain healthy pollinator communities and utilize them with the optimal cultivar. © 2023 The Authors","Agriculture and Ecosystem service and Fragaria and Fruit quality and Pollination and Wild bees and Asia and deformation and ecosystem service and fruit and fruit production and meta-analysis and pollination","10.1016/j.agee.2023.108815","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108815",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individuals and households received the most research attention, followed by national government, civil society, and local government. Europe and North America were the geographic foci of more research than other regions. Behavioral responses were more reported than technical and infrastructural responses and institutional responses. Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests. The review also identifies opportunities for future research on adaptation to other climatic stressors, such as wildfires and tree pests and pathogens, adaptation in other geographic areas, especially Oceania, and adaptation by actors beyond the individual and household level and through institutional adaptation efforts. © 2023 The Author(s)","Adaptation and Climate change and Climate risk reduction and Forestry and Forests and Human behavior and Natural hazards and Systematic review","10.1016/j.crm.2023.100573","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2023.100573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"653","rayyan-674230095","Impacts of hydropeaking: A systematic review","Science of the Total Environment","Hydropower is commonly considered a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, this does not imply an absence of impacts on the riverine ecosystem, the extent of which is expected to increase in the coming years due to the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources and for the climate change. A common consequence of hydroelectric power generation is hydropeaking, which causes rapid and frequent fluctuations in the water flow downstream of hydropower plants. The review incorporates 155 relevant studies published up until November 2023 and follows a systematic review method, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which is a multi-stage systematic procedure for the identification and selection of research documents. The selected studies highlighted several prominent impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic environments. The primary effects include alterations in flow patterns, modification of water temperature, changes in sediment dynamics and fluctuations in dissolved gas levels. These alterations have been found to affect various aspects of aquatic ecosystems, including fish growth, behavior, reproductive success, habitat, and migration patterns, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, hydropeaking can also lead to habitat fragmentation, erosion, and loss of riparian vegetation, thereby impacting terrestrial ecosystems that depend on the aquatic environment. Despite the body of literature reviewed, several knowledge gaps were identified, underscoring the need for further research. There is limited understanding of the long-term ecological consequences of hydropeaking and its cumulative effects on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, there is lack of consensus regarding the quantification of ecosystem services, economic impact, soil moisture content, and weighted usable area due to flow fluctuation and global evolution of energy production from renewable energy sources. Addressing the identified research gaps is crucial for achieving a balance between energy production and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in the context of a rapidly changing global climate. © 2023 The Authors","Ecology and Flow fluctuations and Hydropeaking and PRISMA and Sediment connectivity and Thermopeaking and Animals and Ecosystem and Fishes and Power Plants and Renewable Energy and Water and Aquatic ecosystems and Climate change and Flow of water and Hydroelectric power and Hydroelectric power plants and Soil moisture and water and Aquatic environments and Energy productions and Meta-analysis and Preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analyze and Renewable energy source and Systematic Review and alternative energy and climate change and conservation and ecological impact and flow pattern and habitat fragmentation and hydroelectric power plant and literature review and macroinvertebrate and meta-analysis and power generation and water flow and water temperature and alga and Amphibia and aquatic environment and benthos and consensus and data extraction and ecology and electric power plant and energy yield and environmental aspects and related phenomena and environmental erosion and environmental impact and environmental protection and fish and flow fluctuation and flow kinetics and habitat and hydrodynamics and hydropeaking and hydropower and invertebrate and knowledge gap and land biome and microbial community and migration and nonhuman and organism community and plant and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and quantitative analysis and renewable energy and reproductive success and Review and riparian ecosystem and sediment and sediment connectivity and sediment transport and social aspect and soil moisture and thermopeaking and vegetation and water and water related phenomena and animal and ecosystem and Fossil fuels","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169251","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169251",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

Studying crop pollination from a network approach allows identification of target pollinators for conservation and management, and gaps in our knowledge. Solanaceae represents the third highest ranked family based on economic value, and its production is highly improved by animal pollination. This study aimed to integrate global data on solanaceous crop pollination and analyse the interaction patterns using a meta-network approach. Our questions were: (i) how are interactions structured and what are the structuring roles of species; and (ii) what are the main gaps in our knowledge? Data were obtained through a systematic review of the main scientific databases. The network structure was described using connectivity and modularity calculations, and the role of species using centrality metrics. The 251 pollinator species reported were in seven orders, mainly Hymenoptera (84.9%). The generalists Bombus and Apis species were the most common pollinators. The meta-network was modular, and all modules mostly included bees. Most species were peripherals, around 12% were connectors, and there were no module hubs. Apis mellifera was the only network hub (supergeneralist). The most important pollinators are the most managed pollinators worldwide; however, many native species play a role in structuring the meta-network. Main gaps include species of importance to pepper pollination, lack of species-specific identification, and the need for more robust experimental studies evaluating the pollination efficiency of native, manageable bees. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

To achieve environmental and societal targets, there is a clear and urgent need for more ambitious, longer-term agri-environment funding mechanisms which operate at a large scale. This is, in part, due to the recognition by national governments that shifts in policy for long-term sustainability are needed since many existing agri-environment schemes have not had the desired outcomes. The recent inclusion of conservation covenants in the UK's Environment Act demonstrates one such attempt to address this issue. Through critically analyzing the use of LTAs across the world using a systematic rapid evidence assessment approach, this article assesses the potential of these agreements to deliver landscape-scale environmental benefits and public goods that are increasingly being sought by national governments as they strive for transformative policies to prevent and mitigate environmental and climate catastrophes. Exploring the enablers and barriers to adoption, alongside examples of successful LTAs, we provide an overview from which interested parties—policymakers, land managers, and private enterprises, among others—can begin to understand the opportunities and barriers which surround these agreements. Overall, this literature review identifies several factors likely to affect the uptake of LTAs, including concerns around land managers' and stakeholders' real/perceived capacity to engage, a need for flexibility, finance structures, and how monitoring and evaluation are managed.

Thus, various land management (LM) practices have been done to enhance ES and environmental sustainability. However, very little is known about the influence of efficacious LM practices on multiple ES. This study aims at assessing the implication of LM practices on crop yield, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, soil moisture, runoff, soil loss, nutrient loss, and cultural/societal services. A systematic review and synthesis methods were employed. Predefined criteria were used to screen relevant articles; thereby, 572 observations from 94 studies were extracted and synthesized. The results showed that agronomic practices increased grain yields, soil carbon stock, soil fertility, and soil moisture on average by 28, 29, 43 and 14%, respectively. Biological practices regulated runoff, soil loss, and nutrient loss on average by 46, 59 and 94%, respectively. Overall, LM practices were efficacious to enhance delivery of ES bundles but soil bund and fanyaa juu reduced the grain yield on average by 24 and 22%, respectively. This indicates that there are trade-offs between provisioning and other services like regulating, supporting and cultural under physical structures. However, landscape-level collective impact of different LM practices exhibited without any ES trade-offs. The integration of properly designed physical structures with agronomic and biological practices is imperative to enhance ES and balance the trade-offs in the agricultural landscapes. Further, it is important to find out alternative combinations of agricultural LM practices and evaluate for ES delivery. © 2021 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","Agroecosystems and ecosystem services and grain yield and land management and trade-offs and Ethiopia and agricultural ecosystem and agricultural land and agricultural practice and crop yield and ecosystem service and nutrient loss and runoff and soil fertility and soil moisture and trade-off","10.1080/15715124.2020.1870991","https://doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2020.1870991",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of urban provisioning ES, particularly when implementing an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach as it can offer improved resilience and quality of life in cities. We compiled and systematically analyzed studies on urban ES and ED related to a number of EGI typologies. Our systematic review of the relevant literature via an EGI framework, identified more than 80 peer-reviewed publications that focused on ES and food production in urban areas. An EGI approach can contribute socially, economically, and environmentally to urban sustainability and food security. However, such benefits must be weighed against ED trade-offs, including: potential health risks caused by human exposure to heavy metals and organic chemical contaminants often present in urban surroundings. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for incorporating EGI into urban planning and design, and discuss novel areas for future research.","Edible forest gardens and Nature-based solutions and Urban agriculture and Urban biodiversity and Urban food security and Urban soil toxicity and INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS and COMMUNITY GARDENS and BOTANICAL GARDENS and FOREST GARDENS and PRODUCTION CAPACITY and DOMESTIC GARDEN and HEALTH-BENEFITS and RISK-ASSESSMENT and SCHOOL GARDENS and TRACE-ELEMENTS","10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.026     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.026",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

A systematic review protocol","ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE","Background: This systematic review will address the need for a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. As the number of dams continues to increase worldwide, so too has concerns for their effects on fish populations. Fish injury and mortality at hydroelectric facilities may have serious consequences for fish populations, which are generally the result of three main sources: (1) fish passage through hydroelectric facilities (i.e., turbines, spillways, sluiceways, and other passage routes) during downstream migration for migratory fish; (2) the entrainment of resident fish; and (3) the impingement of fish (migratory or resident) against screens/trash racks. Most studies on the impacts of entrainment and impingement at hydroelectric facilities on fish have primarily focused on: (1) how fish injury and mortality occurs; and (2) evaluations of the effectiveness of various management strategies used to mitigate harm during downstream passage. Given the contributions of migratory and resident adults and juveniles to fish production, a necessary extension is to evaluate the impacts of fish injury and mortality from hydropower dam entrainment and impingement on fish productivity. Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of fishes dependent on our freshwater ecosystems, a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity is needed. Methods: This systematic review will search for, compile, summarize and synthesize evidence on the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environments. Considered studies will include (but not be limited to): (1) those that report a metric related to mortality and injury as an indication of the effect on fish productivity; (2) the change in a metric related to mortality and injury relative to an appropriate control; and (3) articles that scale-up the evaluation to include some estimate of a change in a component of fish productivity (e.g., articles that include an estimate of fish loss from the population due to entrainment/impingement by comparing a metric related to mortality or injury to an estimate of population size or biomass). Only studies where the causal relationship between intervention and outcome is made clear to allow for the effects of entrainment and impingement to be isolated from other potential impacts of hydroelectric power production (e.g., barriers to migration and/or habitat degradation), will be included. The review will use public search engines and specialist websites, and will include both primary and grey literature. Potential effect modifiers will be identified to obtain a better understanding of the factors that are associated with variation in effects among studies, given differences in: (1) site-specific factors (e.g., turbine type, size, power output); (2) methodologies and study designs used to assess impacts; and (3) biological factors (e.g., fish life history stage, body size and morphology). Study quality will be assessed to allow for critical evaluation, including study design, confounding factors and statistical analysis.

A conservation plan with mitigation efforts consisting of seven steps is presented: (1) genetic assessment of Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout populations, (2) reducing gene flow from escapees, (3) reducing infection pressure from salmon lice, (4) conduct an assessment of the freshwater habitats for anadromous salmonids and then implement it in order to restore smolt production, (5) efforts to reduce risk of river pollution from agriculture and industry and minimize impacts from hydropower production, (6) when and where necessary and practical, plant out eyed eggs from the Norwegian Genebank to increase parr and smolt production, and finally, (7) monitor spawning populations and parr densities to evaluate potential effects of the mitigation efforts. Experience and knowledge gained through the plan will be useful for other regions with similar challenges. We call for an initiative to establish a national fund under democratic and public control, where funding can be obtained for projects which focus on mitigation efforts and conservation of salmonid populations.","Anadromous salmonids and threats and salmon farming and hydropower development and stock rehabilitation and CHINOOK SALMON and WILD and RIVER and FLOW and POPULATIONS and HYBRID and FISH and LICE and L. and CONSEQUENCES and Norway","10.1080/17451000.2013.810758     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1080/17451000.2013.810758",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Coastal, Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

Interpreting the factors leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors. Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation data of biomass in the period 1957-2006, we were able to assess the transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957-2006. Only lichen biomass has been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The results presented in this paper show significant and positive relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer population in the period 1957-2006 in the study area. The hypothesis concerning the removal of the ""lichen barrier effect"" by heavy reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also, climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks, freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the period 1955-2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to the reduction of total net emission Of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover, reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design constraints, especially a lack of spatial replication, often hamper the assessment of the impact of such actions. However, extensive temporal replication (i.e. time series) and accounting for potentially confounding variables may alleviate this problem. In alpine-arctic tundra, the red fox Vulpes vulpes is increasing, while many bird species are declining, likely due to increased predation. Here, we assessed the impact of a long-term (12-year) and spatially extensive (~3,500 km2) red fox culling action on the red-listed willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in the Norwegian Arctic. Ptarmigan populations were monitored annually in the impact area and in an adjacent no-action area, including a 5-year period before the action commenced. While logistical constraints prohibited monitoring of red fox population densities, the number of culled foxes and three influential food web covariates were monitored after the onset of the culling action. A Before-After-Control-Impact-Paired-Series (BACIPS) analysis without food web covariates indicated that red fox culling curbed the decline of the population in the impact area, and that ptarmigan population density became ~25% higher than in the reference area. Spatially and temporally variable drivers within the food web confounded the simple BACIPS analysis. Accounting for three food web drivers as covariates in a linear mixed model after the onset of action, yielded a more unbiased impact estimate that amounted to ~40% higher ptarmigan population density (4.3 more ptarmigan/km2) in the red fox impact area. Synthesis and applications. We provide the first evidence of the role of the recent expansion of red fox in the decline of bird populations in tundra. We also show that red fox culling may be able to curb such declines, given that management actions are large scale and long term. As mesopredator culling campaigns are often expensive and controversial, it is important that their impacts are accurately assessed. We demonstrate that the accuracy of impact assessments can be profoundly increased by monitoring drivers of food web dynamics that impinge on the target species so that such drivers can be included as covariates in the analysis. This applies in particular to declining bird populations in boreal and arctic food webs ruled by strong multi-annual interaction cycles. © 2020 The Authors.

"669","rayyan-674232927","Achieving sustainable low flow using hydropower reservoir for ecological water management in Glomma River Norway","Sustainable Water Resources Management","Generally, low flow in rivers occur as a result of extended period of dryness which is likely attributed to drought. Drought is a natural occurrence as an outcome of reduction in precipitation in a region for a long time. Hence, low flow is a growing concern as there are possibilities of more reduced flows in rivers. However, reservoirs can be utilized to mitigate negative effects on the supply of water in dry periods and supply water for other purposes. This study aims at verifying how the low flow condition of Glomma River in Norway has been progressively sustained by hydropower reservoirs. Water Evaluation and Planning Systems (WEAP) software was used for modelling the natural streamflow condition of Glomma River, which is the longest river in Norway, using two unregulated sub-basins within the Glomma catchment. Findings from this study presents that the period between January and March are critical periods in Glomma River. Results show that the values the annual minimum low flow gotten from the three gauges suggest the flow after regulation has increased significantly as opposed to before regulation. The daily average flow is simulated by WEAP to be an average of 100 m3/s during the low flow periods and an average discharge of 350 m3/s during the summer. However, the result indicates that the flow in the summer has reduced by 80% in majority of the years. In addition, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the two sub basins used for this study was 0.9 and 0.76, respectively. Also, the calculation of the coefficient of determination (R2) resulted in 0.85 and 0.78 respectively for the two sub basins.

Location: The mainland of Norway. Methods: We utilized data from the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapes, which recorded vascular plants from 569 plots, placed within 97 monitoring squares systematically distributed throughout agricultural land on the Norwegian mainland. We identified four grassland types: (i) moderately fertilized, moist meadows; (ii) overgrown agricultural land; (iii) cultivated pastures and disturbed ground; and (iv) natural/unfertilized and outfield pastures. Results: Soil moisture and grazing measures were found to be important in explaining species compositional variation in all grassland types. Richness patterns were best explained by complex and differing combinations of environmental indicators. Nevertheless, negative (nitrogen and light level) or unimodal (pH) responses were similar across grassland types. Vegetation plots adjacent to areas historically and/or currently dominated by mires, forests, or pastures, as well as abandoned and overgrown grasslands, had a slightly higher species richness. Larger grasslands surrounding the vegetation plots had slightly less species than smaller grasslands. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that data from a national monitoring programme on agricultural grasslands can be used for plant ecological research. The results indicate that climate-change-related shifts along moisture and nutrient gradients (increases) may alter both species composition and species richness in the studied grasslands. It is likely that large and contiguous managed (grass)land might affect areas perceived as remnants, probably caused by the transformation to homogeneous (agri)cultural landscapes reducing edge zones, which in turn may threaten the species pool and richness.

This may include consumptive and non-consumptive activities, with nature-based tourists being motivated to experience local culture and nature. Thus, tourism can contribute economically and socially to communities associated with protected areas, with the outcomes being both benefits and costs to local people. We carried out a systematic literature review to document and characterise the outcomes of nature-based tourism for people living in and around protected areas (terrestrial and inland waters). We evaluated 89 papers published from 1996 to 2020, most of which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The main benefits were employment, business opportunities and income, and the main costs were acculturation and abandonment of traditional lifestyle/practices, price inflation and conflict/crime. While most benefits were economic, most costs were socio-cultural. We found that benefits were most frequently experienced individually and costs experienced mostly at the collective or community levels. Inconsistencies in reporting of impacts suggests that future research should take a more consistent and systematic approach to evaluating benefits and costs of nature-based tourism from both the demographic and geographic perspectives, be more inclusive, and pay equal attention to objective and subjective measures of costs and benefits. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Local people and nature-based tourism and protected areas and socio-economic benefit and socio-economic cost and systematic literature review","10.1080/13504509.2022.2073616","https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2022.2073616",NA,NA,"Global (89 countries)","Wetlands/peatlands, Forest, Mountains, Naturally open area under the tree-line, Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

While the debate is multifaceted, a central issue concerns the ability of biodiversity to actually persist in shared' human-dominated landscapes. There is a widespread perception that large predators are synonymous with wilderness and have a low tolerance for human-modified landscapes. However, there is an increasing body of evidence that is questioning this paradigm. In order to explore the tolerance levels of Eurasian lynx to human activity, we have analysed data on 49 lynx home ranges in south-eastern Norway occupying a gradient of landscapes from near wilderness to the urban-forest interface. Our results indicate that lynx have the ability to tolerate relatively high levels of human presence both within their home ranges and within the immediate surroundings of their home ranges. Home-range orientations reflect preference for areas associated with low levels of human-induced habitat modification, and avoidance of the more heavily disturbed areas. The results show that lynx have a large potential to exist in shared landscapes if their presence is tolerated by people.","anthropogenic disturbance and carnivore and home range and human presence and lynx and Norway and tolerance and DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS and ROE DEER and SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION and SOUTHEASTERN NORWAY and HABITAT SUITABILITY and BROWN BEARS and SELECTION and LANDSCAPES and LIVESTOCK and DENSITY","10.1111/acv.12168     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/acv.12168",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Forest, Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

To address this gap, this paper offers a critical and systematic review of recent literature regarding acceptance and land use. Our aim is to synthesise the contributions of these publications in order to advance scientific debate on this topic. The data set consists of 132 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and is dominated by empirical papers (mostly quantitative studies) and European case studies. Renewable energy appears as the most important thematic issue, followed by sustainable land use. In these studies, many researchers did not define acceptance or apply a theory. It seems to be perceived as an everyday term with a clear meaning. However, this review reveals that there is no common understanding of acceptance; instead, the given definitions and characteristics are sometimes even contradictory. Acceptance is often considered a positive and desirable outcome of planning projects. Only a few authors understand acceptance as a complex phenomenon. As a cross-sectoral research topic, it applies theories from different disciplines and research fields (psychology, sociology, and innovation research), even though the use of these theories within disciplines is not consistent. Most empirical studies address influencing factors with the aim of explaining decisions about acceptance. However, the theoretical foundation underlying the selection of factors is often weak. Therefore, we recommend that researchers engage in a thorough reflection of notions and concepts, suitable and sound identification of influencing factors. In concluding with our own theoretical-conceptual reflections, we support the idea that acceptance and acceptability should be distinguished to gain more clarity in the use of terms. Thus, acceptability encompasses actor-based and dynamic decision processes. The decisions are products of interactions among the actors, the object, and the context.

Indicators of ES can be developed based on biophysical measures and be used to investigate the service flow from ecosystems to socio-ecological systems. However, the ES concept is multivariate and the use of normalized composite indicators reduces complexity and facilitates communication between science and policy. The aim of this study is to analyze how land use change affects ES and species richness and how the effects are modified by environmental factors by using composite indicators based on biophysical indicators. Using multivariate and regression analyses, we analyze the effect of grazing management abandonment in semi-natural grasslands in Norway on six ES: nutrient cycling, pollination, forage quality, aesthetics and global and regional climate regulation in addition to species richness along soil and climate gradients. Nutrient cycling, forage quality, regional climate regulation, aesthetics and species richness are larger in managed compared to abandoned grasslands. There are trade-offs among ES as different management strategies provide various ES and these trade-offs vary along environmental gradients. Management policies that aim to conserve ES need to have conservation goals that are context dependent, should recognize ES trade-offs and be adapted to local conditions.","Graciela Rusch and Alexander van Oudenhoven and Management strategies and abandonment and grazing and grassland and sheep and biodiversity and FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY and BIODIVERSITY and ABANDONMENT and INDICATORS and TRAITS and CARBON and FRAMEWORK and DATABASE and SYSTEM and BEES","10.1080/26395916.2019.1644534     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2019.1644534",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway","Semi-natural ecosystems","Observational studies"

EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible positive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, including biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https://osf.io/cvh3u/) and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text. Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts, and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitigation measures from practitioners' knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges including scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners' knowledge. © 2019 The Author(s).","Extractive industries and Metal mines and Resource extraction and Social-environmental systems","10.1186/s13750-019-0166-2","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-019-0166-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in much of the case study literature, the value of including indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in the management and governance of landscapes tends to be overlooked and undervalued. Understanding ILK as comprising indigenous, local and traditional knowledge, this systematic review synthesizes how ILK has been viewed and incorporated into landscape-based studies; what processes, mechanisms and areas of focus have been used to integrate it; and the challenges and opportunities that arise in doing so. Queries from bibliographic databases (Web of Science, JSTOR, Scopus and Africa Wide) were employed. Findings from the review underscore that the literature and case studies that link landscapes and ILK are dominated by a focus on agricultural systems, followed by social-ecological systems, indigenous governance, natural resource management, biodiversity conservation and climate change studies, especially those related to early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. The growing importance of multi-stakeholder collaborations in local landscape research and the promotion of inclusive consultations have helped to bring ILK to the fore in the knowledge development process. This, in turn, has helped to support improved landscape management, governance and planning for more resilient landscapes. However, more research is needed to explore ways to more effectively link ILK and scientific knowledge in landscape studies, particularly in the co-management of these social-ecological systems. More studies that confirm the usefulness of ILK, recognize multiple landscape values and their interaction with structures and policies dealing with landscape management and conservation are necessary for enhanced sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.","Collaboration and Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) and Indigenous knowledge (IK) and Interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary research and Landscapes and Local/traditional ecological knowledge (LEK/TEK)","10.3390/LAND9090331","https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND9090331",NA,NA,NA,"Semi-natural ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11–25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6–10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic.

These changes have affected or even caused conflict in several locations. However, conflicts do not erupt in isolation; they are the result of multiple interacting causes. There is limited structural understanding of these causes. In this study, we systematically coded case studies that report on conflict related to land-use change, including deforestation in commodity frontiers, agricultural development on common land, and urban development. Based on an analysis of 62 cases, we identified population growth, overlapping land rights, ethnic fragmentation, and economic inequality as the most frequently reported root causes, while rises in land prices was the most often reported proximate cause. Reported institutional causes suggest that the problem is not necessarily the complete absence of governance mechanisms, but rather that governance mechanisms are not fully equipped to deal with the complexities of the observed land-use changes. © 2021 The Author(s).

Systematic review and meta-analysis","Science of the Total Environment","Urban areas represent a spectrum that goes from being safe habitats for biodiversity (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, without costs to fitness) to being ecological traps (i.e., habitats more or equally preferred, but with costs to fitness). Given the imminent urban expansion, it is valuable to assess how biodiversity is responding to urbanization and thus generate timely conservation strategies. We systematically review the urban ecology literature to analyze how much do we know about the role of urban areas as ecological traps. Using a formal meta-analytical approach, we test whether urban areas are functioning as ecological traps or as safe habitats for different taxonomic groups. We generated a data set of 646 effect sizes of different measures of habitat preferences and fitness from 38 papers published between 1985 and 2020. The data set covered 15 countries and 47 urban areas from four continents, including 29 animal species. Studies from North America and Europe were best represented, and birds were the most studied taxa. Overall, the meta-analysis suggests that urbanized habitats are functioning more as safe sites than as ecological traps, mainly for certain species with characteristics that have allowed them to adapt well to urban areas. That is, many of the studied species prefer more urbanized habitats over other less urbanized sites, and their fitness is not modified, or it is even increased. However, there was high heterogeneity among studies. We also performed meta-regressions to identify variables accounting for this heterogeneity across studies and we demonstrate that outcomes may depend on methodological aspects of studies, such as study design or the approach used to measure habitat preference and fitness. More research is needed for poorly studied regions and on a wider range of species before generalizations can be made on the role of urban areas for biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior and Fitness and Habitat preference and Safe habitats and Urbanization and Animals and Biodiversity and Ecosystem and Europe and North America and Conservation and Health and Urban growth and Data set and Habitat preferences and Meta-analysis and Safe habitat and Systematic Review and Urban areas and Urban habitat and anthropogenic effect and anthropogenic source and fitness and habitat fragmentation and habitat selection and meta-analysis and urbanization and article and bird and conservation biology and ecology and effect size and habitat and human and meta analysis and nonhuman and systematic review and urban area and animal and biodiversity and ecosystem and Ecosystems","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146559","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146559",NA,NA,"Not relevant","Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

Fire has been a variable but major disturbance factor at the site throughout the study period but has ceased during the last 100 years. Picea immigration was primarily a natural process but local establishment occurred after a major disturbance. Cultural impact began 3500 years ago during the Bronze Age, but was most intensive between AD 1600 and AD 1900. It led to the local extinction of deciduous trees and created a biodiversity bottleneck that facilitated the rise to dominance of Picea.

A partial equilibrium forest sector model is applied to analyse effects on roundwood and forest products prices, quantities and trade of four alternative conservation extents. These alternatives are based on a recent biological analysis of the conservation needs in order to protect biodiversity in Norway. Roundwood prices are projected to increase moderately when conservation increases domestically only, since the Norwegian forest industry substitutes imported fibre for domestic. The impacts on roundwood prices are more substantial if also Norway's forest products trading partners increase the forest conservation. If forest owners voluntarily conserve forests subject to an economic compensation ( which currently is the most likely policy in Norway), the model results imply that forest owners on average are better off with increased conservation. Domestic sawnwood production is projected to reduce when assuming increasing forest conservation, while the production level in the pulp and paper industry is almost unaffected in the short-run. Finally, increasing demand for forest products as a result of ""environmental good-will'' may increase roundwood prices and harvest levels in unaffected forest areas significantly.","demand and supply and forest conservation and forest industry and partial equilibrium model and timber harvest and trade and WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY and ABATEMENT INVESTMENTS and WESTERN-EUROPE and DEMAND and CERTIFICATION and MANAGEMENT and MODELS and IMPACT and Norway and Trees","10.1007/s10640-004-8248-0     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-004-8248-0",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

Risk assessment of erosion has formed the basis for implementation of the measures. The soil P content has increased during recent decades, motivating an evaluation of its effect on P transfer in the landscape. The present study describes the spatial variability of runoff P concentrations from an agricultural dominated catchment (4.5 km(2)), representative for agriculture in south-eastern Norway. The concentrations of suspended sediments ( SS), total P (TP) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff from 22 subcatchments (0.3 - 263 ha) during one year ( monthly and during runoff-events) were evaluated. Contributions from point sources were 38 kg TP yr(-1) compared to a total P loss of 685 kg yr(-1) from the whole catchment. During low flow, mean diffuse TP concentration in runoff from subcatchments varied from 28 to 382 mu g l(-1). The mean low flow TP concentration was 39 mu g l(-1) from the housing area ( only diffuse runoff) and 33 mu g l(-1) from the forested area. During high flow the highest diffuse TP concentration was measured in an area with high erosion risk and high soil P status. At the subcatchment level the transfer of SS varied from 25 to 175% of the whole catchment SS transfer. Correspondingly for TP, the transfer varied from 50 to 260% of the whole catchment TP transfer.

Erosion risk estimates were closely related to the SS concentration (R(2) = 0.83).

We combine four lines of evidence: an analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in a time series of subfossil teeth, distribution data of bone finds from 31 archaeological sites, changes in the relative abundance of wild ungulates from four of these sites and historical documents. A significant change in Sus diet, indicated by delta(15)N levels, was found. This coincided with the spread of agriculture and indicates a change from wild boar to domestic pigs. Based on this finding the distributional data show that the Norwegian wild boar was limited to the coastal broadleaved forests even during the most optimal climatic period. A reduction in the relative abundance of wild boar, and later extinction, seems to coincide with a reduction in such habitat, caused partly by climatic change but more pronouncedly by human habitat alterations, and competition with domestic animals. The data indicate that the primary factor limiting the northern distribution of wild boar is the availability of food resources.","climate change and extinction and habitat fragmentation and land use and stable isotopes and wild boar and SUS-SCROFA and POPULATION-DENSITY and WESTERN NORWAY and LIFE-HISTORY and CARBON and NITROGEN and DIET and TEMPERATURE and ECOLOGY and EUROPE","10.1177/0959683610369505     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683610369505",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

Pollen diagrams from five sites (Vingen, Skatestraumen, Selja, Osneset, Gossen) are presented and the heathland development discussed. Soil, topography and cultural history differ between the sites, whereas the climate is relatively similar along the coast. The investigation shows presence of Calluna in forest openings from the Mesolithic, but cultural activity including grazing did not result in heathland development before 1300 cal. BC. The oldest heathland is found in an area of moraine and marine sand well suited for agricultural activity where heathlands developed as part of the farming economy. At sites with poorer soil, heathland development took place in the Iron Age and medieval time, as outfield pastures for farms located in some distance to the sites. By the medieval monastery at Selja, heathlands existed from the Late Iron Age and expanded into grasslands and cereal fields when the monastery was abandoned. The investigation illustrates the variation that exists in heathland development and the different factors that may cause the development. Until 1000 years ago, the coastal landscape probably held a mosaic of vegetation types; heathlands, grasslands, cultivated fields and forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In this study we investigate a time series of ancient and contemporary DNA from Norwegian red deer spanning about 7,000 years. Our main aim was to investigate how increasing agricultural land use, hunting pressure and possibly human mediated translocation of animals have affected the genetic diversity on a long-term scale. Results: We obtained mtDNA (D-loop) sequences from 73 ancient specimens. These show higher genetic diversity in ancient compared to extant samples, with the highest diversity preceding the onset of agricultural intensification in the Early Iron Age. Using standard diversity indices, Bayesian skyline plot and approximate Bayesian computation, we detected a population reduction which was more prolonged than, but not as severe as, historic documents indicate. There are signs of substantial changes in haplotype frequencies primarily due to loss of haplotypes through genetic drift. There is no indication of human mediated translocations into the Norwegian population. All the Norwegian sequences show a western European origin, from which the Norwegian lineage diverged approximately 15,000 years ago. Conclusions: Our results provide direct insight into the effects of increasing habitat fragmentation and human hunting pressure on genetic diversity and structure of red deer populations. They also shed light on the northward post-glacial colonisation process of red deer in Europe and suggest increased precision in inferring past demographic events when including both ancient and contemporary DNA.","Ancient DNA and Habitat fragmentation and Harvesting and Mitochondrial DNA and Genetic diversity and Translocation and Cervus elaphus and CERVUS-ELAPHUS and GENETIC DIVERSITY and PHYLOGEOGRAPHY and DIFFERENTIATION and CALIBRATION and EXTINCTION and ALGORITHM and NETWORKS and DYNAMICS and HARVEST and DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase and DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase and DNA, B-Form and DNA, A-Form and DNA","10.1186/1471-2148-12-191     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-191",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA
"692","rayyan-674266431","Genetic variation and structure of house sparrow populations: is there an island effect?","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","Population genetic structure and intrapopulation levels of genetic variation have important implications for population dynamics and evolutionary processes. Habitat fragmentation is one of the major threats to biodiversity. It leads to smaller population sizes and reduced gene flow between populations and will thus also affect genetic structure. We use a natural system of island and mainland populations of house sparrows along the coast of Norway to characterize the different population genetic properties of fragmented populations. We genotyped 636 individuals distributed across 14 populations at 15 microsatellite loci. The level of genetic differentiation was estimated using F-statistics and specially designed Mantel tests were conducted to study the influence of population type (i.e. mainland or island) and geographic distance on the genetic population structure. Furthermore, the effects of population type, population size and latitude on the level of genetic variation within populations were examined. Our results suggest that genetic processes on islands and mainland differed in two important ways. First, the intrapopulation level of genetic variation tended to be lower and the occurrence of population bottlenecks more frequent on islands than the mainland. Second, although the general level of genetic differentiation was low to moderate, it was higher between island populations than between mainland populations. However, differentiation increased in mainland populations somewhat faster with geographical distance. These results suggest that population bottleneck events and genetic drift have been more important in shaping the genetic composition of island populations compared with populations on the mainland. Such knowledge is relevant for a better understanding of evolutionary processes and conservation of threatened populations.","founder effect and F-statistics and genetic structure and genetic variation and isolation by distance and Passer domesticus and PASSER-DOMESTICUS and INBREEDING DEPRESSION and MAINLAND POPULATIONS and DISPERSAL and HABITAT and DIVERSITY and SIZE and DIFFERENTIATION and EXTINCTION and PATTERNS and Genetic Variation","10.1111/mec.12226     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.12226",10.421906,63.446827,"Norway",NA,NA

There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.","land-use change and monitoring and restoration and salmonid and woody debris and LARGE WOODY DEBRIS and BROWN TROUT and STREAM HABITAT and SALMO-TRUTTA and BROOK TROUT and TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES and CUTTHROAT TROUT and FISH HABITAT and AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS and RIVER RESTORATION","10.1111/fwb.12888     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12888",NA,NA,NA,"Rivers & lakes","Summarised evidence"

As northern regions are still relatively undisturbed and will likely face clear increases in temperature in the near-future, we examined the signs of biodiversity change due to anthropogenic stressors using a systematic review of previous studies. Our aim was to map where, in which way, and owing to which stressor biodiversity in northern regions has changed. We made a systematic literature search covering the years between 2000 and 2015 to obtain a comprehensive selection of recent research. As species richness was clearly the most commonly used indicator of biodiversity, we only concentrated on this aspect of biodiversity. We compared different biological groups, regions, and ecosystems. In the majority of the cases, anthropogenic stressors had decreased species richness, or had no effects on it, while increasing or multiple effects of stressors on species richness were less common. Freshwater ecosystems were most sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, as species richness often decreased owing to these stressors. The effects of land use on richness were covered relatively widely in the selected set of articles, but the effects of other components of global change on species richness require further attention. Despite the fact that pollution was not as commonly studied stressor as land use, it was the most harmful stressor type affecting species richness. Geographically, most studies were located in boreal Canada or Fennoscandia, while no studies were executed in vast circumpolar areas where the temperature rise has been greatest and the projected climate change is likely to be fast. Overall, we could find an alarmingly small set of studies that described the effects of actual anthropogenic stressors in real-life circumstances in northern high latitudes.","anthropogenic stress and Arctic and biodiversity and boreal and climate change and high latitudes and FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS and CLIMATE-CHANGE and MULTIPLE STRESSORS and BIODIVERSITY LOSS and PATTERNS and DIVERSITY and RESPONSES and THREATS and IMPACT and CONSEQUENCES","10.1139/er-2016-0085     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2016-0085",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Summarised evidence"

We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.","abundance and biodiversity and city size and gradient length and rural and species richness and suburban and systematic review and SPECIES RICHNESS and NORTHERN EUROPE and DIVERSITY and ABUNDANCE and AVIFAUNA and ECOLOGY and BIODIVERSITY and COMMUNITIES and LANDSCAPES and CITIES","10.1111/gcb.13964     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13964",NA,NA,NA,"Urban ecosystems","Summarised evidence"

We assessed the economic methods applied, the attributes valued, and the timing of the evaluation in relation to the age of restoration along with publication trends. Research on the topic is increasing, but studies from Africa and South America are lacking. A diverse cross-disciplinary interest is notable, yet collaborations between disciplines are less frequent. Of particular concern is that only a third of the studies were undertaken postrestoration, and even fewer for restorations older than 10 years.

It is closely linked to urban sprawl (low-density or dispersed urban development). Land take is a major environmental challenge, especially for biodiversity conservation, as it destroys and fragments natural habitats. In order to assess how the scientific literature dedicated to this topic adresses the determinants of land take, we analyzed 193 scientific articles retrieved through a systematic methodology. We summarized the causal relationships identified between land take and different explanatory factors. Among them, population and income growth, as well as the development of transport infrastructure and automobile use, are widely studied drivers that are most often found to increase land take. Political and institutional factors are extensively mentionned in the literature, suggesting that urban sprawl is not a mere result of ""market forces"" but is also shaped though public policies. Weak or unadequate planning, subsidies for land consumption and automobile transportation are said to increase urban sprawl, while infrastructure pricing and subsidies for urban renewal would have the opposite effect. The institutional setting, especially administrative fragmentation, reliance on local taxes, and competition between local jurisdictions, is suspected to be a major determinant of land take. The effect of many factors however remains relatively undocumented or controversial in the reviewed literature, including widely used policy instruments.","Urban sprawl and Land take and Drivers and Determinants and Public policies and BIODIVERSITY and GROWTH and SPRAWL","10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.08.017     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.08.017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Today however, agroecosystems undergo biophysical changes because of land-use and management changes (LUMC), such as intensive agriculture, urbanisation, and land abandonment. Typically, environmental conflicts emerge between stakeholders with differing interests in land areas around the LUMC. Cumulatively, these changes and conflicts have substantial influence on the CES appreciation of the farmland, triggering different types of responses, including social mobilisation and resistance. A comprehensive analysis of these processes was missing in the literature. Here we present a systematic review of CES provided by agroecosystems at the global level, we explore their interconnections through network analysis, and analyse the interrelation between LUMC, CES and environmental conflicts. The review includes 155 peer-reviewed articles, representing empirical data from 81 countries. Twenty main categories of CES and their subcategories delivered by agroecosystems are identified. Through the network analysis we demonstrate how CES are interrelated, with agricultural heritage as a connecting core. In a comprehensive map, we further identify which LUMC types have influence upon specific CES categories, and what are the causes, outcomes of, and responses to environmental conflicts that emerge from these processes. CES and agroecosystems cannot be seen separately from one another, as a reflection of secular or recently-created relationships people have with their environments. While these relationships are dynamic, LUMC may lead to their impairment or even loss, with ensuing impacts on biocultural diversity. The resulting environmental conflicts push most frequently for greater participation of actors involved in farming, socio-cultural revalorisation of farmland activities and the promotion of multi-functionality.","Agroecosystems and Cultural ecosystem services and Land-use management changes and Environmental conflicts and ECOSYSTEM SERVICES and POLITICAL ECOLOGY and CLIMATE-CHANGE and LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT and TRADE-OFFS and AGRICULTURE and HERITAGE and BIODIVERSITY and VALUATION and FUTURE","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.016     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.016",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural","Summarised evidence"

Considering its scale and its contribution to forest management outcome, efficient management of selective logging is crucial to address challenges associated with timber demand, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Ongoing selective logging has been a key reason for forest degradation despite a set of recommended practices such as reduced-impact logging. With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders’ capacity.
