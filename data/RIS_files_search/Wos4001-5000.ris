AB  - Green space in cities contributes to the quality of life for city dwellers, e. g., by increasing the opportunity for recreation. However, perception of urban green space is influenced by multiple factors. We investigated effects of biodiversity and environment-related attitudes on visual and auditory perceptions of urban green space. Field measurements of biodiversity were conducted in six sites across an urban gradient in Gothenburg, Sweden, and three categories of biodiversity-high, medium, low-were established. Households were sent a survey on aesthetic perception of urban green space, sound perception and the importance of trees and plants for the perception of bird species. Each respondent focused on the site that was located nearby. The environment-related attitudes comprised BNature-oriented and BUrban-oriented persons and were based on participants' own attitude estimations. It was shown that participants' Bsubjective aesthetic and sound-related perception of urban greenery were in line with the Bobjectively measured subdivisions of high, medium and low biodiversity. So also were their estimations of the importance of trees and plants for perception of bird species in urban greenery, although differing only between high and medium/low biodiversity conditions. Persons rating themselves as highly nature-oriented were shown to give higher scores to urban green space aesthetics and to value greenery-related sounds higher, and to attach greater importance to trees and plants in their perception of bird species in urban greenery, than less nature-oriented persons. Highly urban-oriented persons compared to less urban-oriented persons did the same, but only regarding urban greenery-related aesthetics and sounds of nature. We conclude that environment-related attitudes influence perceptions of green space. Moreover, our findings support the idea that biodiversity per se also influences perceptions; people value green space significantly more with high than with low measured biodiversity. Urban planning needs to provide city inhabitants with green spaces that are species-rich, lush, varied and rich with natural sounds.

AB  - Because of the limited spatial extent and comprehensiveness of protected areas, an increasing emphasis is being placed on conserving habitats which promote biodiversity within production forest. For this reason, alternative silvicultural programs need to be evaluated with respect to their implications for forest biodiversity, especially if these programs are likely to be adopted. Here we simulated the effect of varied rotation length and associated thinning regimes on habitat availability in Scots pine and Norway spruce production forests, with high and low productivity. Shorter rotation lengths reduced the contribution made by production trees (trees grown for industrial use) to the availability of key habitat features, while concurrently increasing the contribution from retention trees. The contribution of production trees to habitat features was larger for high productivity sites, than for low productivity sites. We conclude that shortened rotation lengths result in losses of the availability of habitat features that are key for biodiversity conservation and that increased retention practices may only partially compensate for this. Ensuring that conservation efforts better reflect the inherent variation in stand rotation lengths would help improve the maintenance of key forest habitats in production forests.

AB  - In recent years, events and festivals have been increasingly seen as a good way of developing the regions and the tourism in localities in eastern Finland. In order to be able to produce comparable information on the different impacts of events in Finland, and to gain continuity to event research, a pilot version of a Finnish Event Evaluation Tool ( FEET) was created in 2007. The article presents the development of FEET which was piloted in 12 events. The tool is based on former impacts research. It concentrates on evaluating socio-cultural impacts of events in parallel with economic impacts. Innovative in FEET is the possibility of collecting comparable information from several stakeholder groups at the same time.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate differences in road safety attitudes, driver behavior, and traffic risk perception between Turkey and Norway. A questionnaire survey was conducted among a sample of Norwegian (n=247) and Turkish (n=213) road users. The results show that Turkish respondents perceived traffic risk to be higher than Norwegian respondents. Turkish respondents reported safer attitudes towards drinking and driving than Norwegian respondents, while Norwegians reported safer attitudes towards speeding. Turkish respondents reported a lower frequency of speeding behaviors than Norwegian respondents, whereas Norwegian respondents reported a lower frequency of drinking and driving. Traffic risk perception was related to road safety attitudes and behaviors among Norwegian respondents but not among Turkish respondents. The results were discussed with respect to differences in traffic safety, traffic culture, and the development levels in Turkey and Norway.

AB  - Negative consequences of human activities for biodiversity may be mitigated by compensation measures. Although the interest in applying compensation measures is generally increasing, such measures have rarely been applied in forestry. Many boreal forests are managed by clear felling and used for timber and pulp production. There is an increasing interest in intensifying forestry by also harvesting slash and stumps for biofuel at felling. We evaluated the efficiency of combining intensified forestry production with compensation measures, by estimating the net revenue from slash and stump harvest, the cost of high stump creation, and simulating habitat amount for 680 bark- and wood-living species (fungi, beetles, lichens, and bryophytes) in Norway spruce forests in Sweden under different scenarios of biofuel harvest and compensation. We show that the harvest of slash and stumps has a clear negative effect on the habitat amount available for many species, especially for many fungi and beetles. Combining slash harvesting with the creation of high stumps results in an economic surplus and at the same time provides significantly more habitat in comparison with no slash harvesting and no high stump creation. When undertaking stump harvesting it is currently impossible to achieve such positive effects. Thus, our analyses show that compensation can sometimes be a useful tool when both economic and biodiversity goals must be achieved in forestry, but in other cases it is a better alternative to avoid the activity that causes the negative effects.

AB  - Cities are experiencing unprecedented climate impacts related to increasing temperatures, which vary within a city due to the heterogenous nature of urban environments. Adapting urban areas to heat requires efforts on multiple levels from urban governance, spatial planning and design to adapting everyday activities. This paper presents the prototype of a pedestrian routing tool to support citizens in navigating urban heat, and the results of tests and interviews with 24 prac-titioners and experts in Portugal and Sweden. The study aims to assess how and to what extent a navigation tool on urban heat could support urban climate risk management, and to evaluate the potential of the tool to support everyday adaptation and increase citizen engagement. We explore what functionality and additional information would be required to make the tool useful and relevant for different user groups. Results indicate that (i) climate services that fit in your pocket increase access to climate information and have potential to guide everyday adaptation practices; and (ii) applications need to be contextualized and tailored to match the needs and decision contexts of the user through integration of relevant information or tools.

AB  - Non-industrial private forest owners in Sweden are encouraged to mitigate environmental damages from forestry on their properties under a principle of freedom with responsibility, although the level of mitigation is generally left to the owners' discretion. One voluntary measure private forest owners are encouraged to take is setting aside a part of their productive forests for conservation. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how non-industrial private forest owner beliefs concerning both their own and the Swedish state's responsibility for nature protection differ among owners of certified forests, who automatically leave a set-aside, and those who have stayed out of forest certification but have decided to leave a set-aside. Results of a Heckman selection bivariate probit model show that the more a respondent believes the state is responsible for fulfilling environmental goals compared to private forest owners, the less likely it is that an owner of a non-certified forest will leave a set-aside for conservation. Beliefs about responsibility do not, however, differ among owners of certified and non-certified forests. From a policy perspective, Swedish government agencies may have difficulty steering specific measures taken by private forest owners who are interested in conservation but have stayed out of forest certification regimes.

AB  - In light of the increased focus on climate change adaptation, there is a need to understand when and how adaptation decision-making generates trade-offs. This study presents a novel framework for adaptation trade-off assessments, which integrates (I) two trade-off mechanisms (direct and interactions) and (II) two types of trade-off characteristics (substantive and processual). Perspectives on adaptation trade-offs were collected from 37 Swedish and Finnish agricultural experts through semi-structured interviews supported by serious gaming and visualization. The data were thematically analysed based on the provided analytical framework. The results show that trade-offs in agricultural adaptation decision-making processes involve balancing a number of socio-ecological system aspects that are of different character and have different functions. The study identified 20 aspects generating trade-offs related to adaptation management in Swedish and Finnish agriculture, among which 'crop yield and profitability', 'farm economy', 'pest and weed robustness' and 'soil quality' were discussed as the most prominent by respondents. The framework enables an examination of complex trade-off structures that can have implications for adaptation management decisions. The results show that the identified aspects constitute different components and functions of trade-offs, including both processual and/or substantive ones. In conclusion, the 20 identified aspects and the framework together demonstrate the importance of the two types of adaptation trade-offs and the resulting complexity of climate change adaptation decision-making in Swedish and Finnish agriculture. Furthermore, the study asserts the potential of applying the framework for various strategic contexts-to recognize and cope with trade-offs in adaptation management.

AB  - Agricultural non-point source pollution has become the major source of pollutants contributing to the degradation of water quality in most of the world's water bodies. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are major contributors to the eutrophication of surface water bodies, and nitrogen can also cause high nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) levels in groundwater. High levels of nutrients cause excessive alga growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in the water as the algae decomposes, and reducing the amount of habitat for animals. Loss of N is also an economic for the farmers besides it's negative environmental impacts. Monitoring nutrient loss from the landscape with diverse soils, geology, topography, land use, and management scenarios is very laborious and expensive. Therefore, an alternate assessment technique is necessary to provide an estimate of the critical areas of pollution within a given watershed. Evaluation of the critical areas of pollution within a watershed makes the determination of proper remediation means for the pollution infected areas possible.
   This study describes the usage of geographic information system (GIS) and appropriate indexing procedures for evaluating the critical areas of pollution in two selected watersheds; one in northern Maryland, USA and the other in southern Sweden. The watershed in Maryland has an area of about 346 ha and soils are predominantly Penn silt loam series. The watershed in southern Sweden is about 1,460 ha with sand being the dominating soil. The assessment parameters used in determining proper pollution indexes vary from one location to the next. However, they are principally similar. Parameters considered in Maryland include soils, geology, topography, distance from stream, land cover/land use, nutrient management practices. Such data and appropriate indexing equations were used to develop runoff potential, erosion potential and leaching potential for each watershed segment, thus enabling the computation of overall watershed pollution index. The indexing strategy for determining nitrogen leaching in southern Sweden included factors such as crop type, tillage, manure application, and fertilizer overdose. These factors were used as multipliers to adjust the "normal leaching rates" for the type of soil in southern Sweden. Results obtained from these two studies will be presented and usage of the indexing technique as a management tool will be discussed. Practical aspects of using such strategy for pollution identification and possible remediation will be presented.

AB  - Purpose - In the past 10 years, most countries and cities have published a national adaptation strategy that outlines the strategic approach to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and to adapt to the impacts of it. The existence of an adaptation strategy does not, however, equal implementation of adaptation and the fact that adaptation is taking place across multiple levels also poses new challenges to its efficient implementation. The literature on barriers of adaptation has been increasing rapidly, questioning whether there is a misconception that barriers to implementation can be solved at the local level.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the implementation of adaptation strategies across multiple levels of governance by focusing on the land use planning in Finland. The case study examines the implementation of adaptation in the metropolitan region of Helsinki through a policy document analysis.
   Findings - The conclusions highlight that there are barriers at the local level that emerge from the existing governance structures and cannot be solved by the local level alone. There needs to be a further recognition that coordination across levels of governance is a factor in overcoming barriers.
   Originality/value - So far, there are very few studies that have analysed barriers in relation to the implementation of adaptation in a multi-level setting, and none in the land use sector, which is inherently hierarchical in nature.

AB  - Depending on the spatial density of built cover and location within a catchment, residential areas make varying contributions to surface runoff throughout different rainfall events. This study examined these contributions and the associated effect of different surface covers and sustainable drainage systems on runoff generation. The Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method was applied to analyse urban development in the Hojea river catchment in southern Sweden.
   The results indicated that identical amounts of surface runoff are generated by low-density residential areas on heavy clay soils and high-density residential areas on sandy soils. However, increasing the density of built-up areas on sandy soils is likely to be more disruptive to the hydrological balance and to generate a greatly increasing difference in runoff as building density and impermeable surface area increase. A similar pattern is likely to occur if rainfall intensity increases. It may therefore be appropriate to apply different planning considerations to residential developments depending on the existing soil group, e.g. conserving existing vegetated surfaces on sandy soil and incorporating permeable paving materials and sub-surface infiltration beds in development on clayey soils. Increased area of impermeable surface cover will increase surface runoff in all residential areas, irrespective of building density, soil group and rainfall intensity. However, adapting a systems approach in combining vegetative structures and permeable paving materials with subsurface infiltration beds can help mitigate the impact of surface runoff, particularly in urban developments on clay-rich soils.

AB  - The development and deployment of clean technologies must be accelerated to avoid a more than 2 degree warmer world. Redeployment of the vast resources concentrated in established sectors is one possible way to advance cleantech industries. However, prior research on sustainability transitions tends to emphasize competition and conflict between established sectors and cleantech industries. There is thus a need for exploring in more depth how established sectors may positively contribute to cleantech industries. Based on the notion of structural overlaps, we propose an extended version of the technological innovation systems framework to study how established sectors influence cleantech industries, and present new conceptual definitions and indicators. We apply the framework to a case study of the relationship between the oil and gas sector and the offshore wind power industry in Norway. Our empirical results show that the oil and gas sector has several positive influences on offshore wind power enabled by technological overlaps and diversifying firms. However, misaligned informal institutions weaken such influences, manifested as e.g. conflicting priorities and wavering commitment of diversified oil and gas firms to the new industry. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the proposed framework and the relevance of our findings for policy and further research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a company-level biodiversity impact assessment framework tailored to the aquaculture industry. Using publicly available data from Norway, we analyze the relative biodiversity performance of companies based on the following impact variables: sea lice, escapes, diseases, bottom conditions, and lice treatments. We apply an unsupervised clustering methodology to classify and rank companies based on their aggregated biodiversity impact over time. Our findings suggest that companies operating in the northern production areas of Norway have a geographical advantage due to lower sea temperature and lower density of localities, resulting in higher biodiversity rankings. When considering the biodiversity ranking within regions with comparable biological conditions, we find that larger and publicly traded salmon farming companies perform better than smaller privately owned ones, potentially indicating better managerial practices related to biodiversity issues.

AB  - Digitalizing cities has become increasingly complex and difficult to control despite advanced computational tools. The comprehension of emergent, dynamic agent-pattern interaction is limited. Studies show that the implementation of large-scale plans occasionally fails to meet expectations due to uncertainty in urban actor processes and institutions. Theories of complexity and resilience reflecting urban unpredictability and non-equilibrium enable understanding and planning methods for guiding actors. We explored empirically via close reading and spatial analyses the ability of the traditional master planning instrument to steer the actor allocation in Tampere, Finland. The plan apparently failed to appropriately guide the actors, who formed self-organizing patterns colliding with the planning aims enabled by deviations and lower-level planning instruments. The planning mode was either enabling or reactive. We recognized three types of self-organization: single-point attraction, emergent type, and location-based self-organization. Self-organization was the major force behind urban transition. Only certain large-scale projects in the city center somewhat complied with the planning aims, however through negotiations. We proposed planning solutions encouraging and guiding self-organizing patterns by recognizing complexity in strategies, and with loose plans, constant monitoring, correcting, and experimenting in planning. The results participate in building more general knowledge of planning considering self-organizing urban dynamics and provide applications for urban planning.

AB  - Urban planning is widely advocated as an important way to encourage the more sustainable management of urban stormwater, using alternatives to piped systems. This paper explores the way in which Swedish water professionals have opportunities to influence stormwater planning and the barriers that limit their participation in this process. Empirical evidence has been obtained from in-depth semi-structured interviews with urban water professionals from nine Swedish municipalities. The paper shows that there is a perception of the legal requirements related to the provision of drainage services that inhibits the utilisation of non-piped solutions. There are also reservations about a dichotomy that inhibits actions - is stormwater an issue for the planning department or for the water department? It is concluded that water professionals have unique opportunities to integrate stormwater management approaches within wider urban planning practice and, hence, are able to encourage the use of alternative systems that are more sustainable than using traditional pipes or sewers.

AB  - Millennia of human land-use have resulted in the widespread occurrence of what have been coined 'domesticated ecosystems'. The anthropogenic imprints on diversity, composition, structure and functioning of such systems are well documented. However, evolutionary consequences of human activities in these ecosystems are enigmatic. Calluna vulgaris (L.) is a keystone species of coastal heathlands in northwest Europe, an ancient semi-natural landscape of considerable conservation interest. Like many species from naturally fire-prone ecosystems, Calluna shows smoke-adapted germination, but it is unclear whether this trait arose prior to the development of these semi-natural landscapes or is an evolutionary response to the anthropogenic fire regime. We show that smoke-induced germination in Calluna is found in populations from traditionally burnt coastal heathlands but is lacking in naturally occurring populations from other habitats with infrequent natural fires. Our study thus demonstrates evolutionary imprints of human land-use in semi-natural ecosystems. Evolutionary consequences of historic anthropogenic impacts on wildlife have been understudied, but understanding these consequences is necessary for informed conservation and ecosystem management.

AB  - 1 We attempt to explain the current distribution of a long-lived perennial plant, Succisa pratensis, in a rural landscape in southern Sweden by linking its population biology with documented changes in the landscape, using a dynamical, spatially explicit model incorporating population dynamics and spatial spreading of the plant. Changes in the landscape were inferred from historical maps (1850 and 1900) and aerial photographs (1945 and 2001).
   2 We tested whether predictions for the current species distribution are affected by assumptions about its early 19th century distribution, to determine whether recent history and current processes are dominant, and how past landscape changes determine current distributions.
   3 Initial conditions influence predictions of current distribution, suggesting that the current distribution still partly reflects the distribution of the species in the early 19th century. A period of 150 years is too short for Succisa to have spread extensively if dispersal parameters are given realistic values.
   4 Simulations in which present-day land-use patterns were imposed at earlier dates showed that changes in landscape structure over the past 175 years also had a strong effect on the present-day habitat occupancy and population sizes of Succisa.
   5 The dominant process for Succisa now is extinction from marginal habitats. It is therefore likely that the (relatively) high present-day occupation patterns are still due to much larger areas having been available in the past rather than to successful dispersal. Although the species has responded to landscape changes, there is little evidence of population sizes reaching equilibrium.
   6 Our approach shows that the wealth of landscape information available from historical maps can be linked with data on population biology by means of dynamical models that can make predictions about species dynamics.

AB  - In Sweden, nature conservation management (NCM) is not applied to the extent needed to avoid negative impacts on biodiversity in voluntary set-asides and formal reserves. A limiting factor is the uncertainty of the costs for the operations caused by a lack of models for estimating costs and revenues in mechanized NCM. These may explain why some operations are highly profitable while others result in a net loss. Our aim was to compare harvester time consumption in NCM operations to final felling operations and estimate the added cost. Harvesting in 14 NCM stands and 399 final felling stands were studied using follow-up data. Harvesting intensity in NCM treatments varied generally between 25% and 50% of the standing volume. Time consumption in NCM operations was 1.1 to 1.4 times greater than in final felling, depending on management goal, machine size, and tree volume. Increased harvester time consumption is not the only factor influencing logging costs in an NCM operation. Compared to final felling, forwarder time consumption is expected to increase in the same way as in thinning operations. Field visits during spring 2022 allowed visual inspections of the stands after harvest and showed that NCM plans were generally followed with minor deviations.

AB  - Anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats is a global driver of wildlife population declines. Local population responses to such environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and social factors may influence population responses. Thus, understanding how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental mechanisms underlying demographic responses. Here we investigated the effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern Sweden. We assessed the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics, using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. Stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests than in natural forests. Population growth was most sensitive to breeder survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those delaying dispersal. Forestry decreased population growth in managed forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Increased snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. Population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted climate scenarios. Thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our study species, and in other species with similar life-history characteristics and habitat requirements.

AB  - We investigated the impact of Norway's current zonal carnivore management system for four large carnivore species on sheep farming. Sheep losses increased when the large carnivores were reintroduced, but has declined again after the introduction of the zoning management system. The total number of sheep increased outside, but declined slightly inside the management zones. The total sheep production increased, but sheep farming was still lost as a source of income for many farmers. The use of the grazing resources became more extensive. Losses decreased because sheep were removed from the open outfield pastures and many farmers gave up sheep farming. While wolves expel sheep farming from the outfield grazing areas, small herds can still be kept in fenced enclosures. Bears are in every respect incompatible with sheep farming. Farmers adjust to the seasonal and more predictable behavior of lynx and wolverine, although these species also may cause serious losses when present. The mitigating efforts are costly and lead to reduced animal welfare and lower income for the farmers, although farmers in peri-urban areas increasingly are keeping sheep as an avocation. There is a spillover effect of the zoning strategy in the sense that there is substantial loss of livestock to carnivores outside, but geographically near the management zones. The carnivore management policy used in Norway is a reasonably successful management strategy when the goal is to separate livestock from carnivores and decrease the losses, but the burdens are unequally distributed and farmers inside the management zones are at an economic disadvantage.

AB  - UNESCO's World Heritage Convention has become a global policy for natural and cultural conservation and in particular the intricate relation between the two. This article presents two cases, Laponia and the Lofoten Islands, put forward as mixed World Heritage Sites by the governments of Sweden and Norway. The overall national goals of the nominations have been to ensure sustainable human use of natural resources and the conservation of biodiversity. However, in both countries the nomination and implementation of mixed sites have produced a series of challenges at the municipality management level. Comparing the processes of promoting Laponia and Lofoten as World Heritage Sites, the article discusses the challenges of local involvement and democratic participation in national decision-making by asking what comprises local involvement and co-management at mixed World Heritage Sites. Why does the implementation of management at mixed World Heritage Sites create conflict between local stakeholders and the national governments of Norway and Sweden?

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been ascribed an important role for decreasing energy use and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in urban areas. Through automation, dematerialisation, persuasion and soft transformation ICT holds the potential of making urban life more sustainable, without cutting back in quality of life. To fully utilise the potential of ICT for sustainable cities there is a need to reconsider the design and technical specification of buildings and infrastructure systems, as well as what actors to involve in the planning and management of the city. A ubiquitous introduction of ICT for sustainability may also influence the spatial and institutional organisation of the city. In spite of this, there is little research on ICT for sustainable cities from the perspective of planning and governance. This paper aims to abate parts of this knowledge gap through exploring two aspects of planning that we see as crucial for a successful implementation of ICT for sustainable cities. The first of these aspects concerns when in the planning process decisions regarding ICT need to be taken. The second aspect deals with what actor networks are needed to implement the ICT solutions and how these can be managed, or meta-governed. These aspects are explored through literature studies, workshops and interviews with urban planners and other actors engaged in the Royal Seaport project in Stockholm, Sweden.

AB  - Considerable pressure is placed on wind power in Sweden due to the country's goal of generating 100% of its electricity from fossil free resources. The aim was to develop the REWIND methodological framework to support wind power planning, built on spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA). In addition, the purpose was to develop a conflict score as a novel component of this framework, for handling goal conflicts. This framework includes the scoping, design and evaluation stages. It was applied in a case study of Vasternorrland County with extensive involvement of stakeholders throughout the process.The conflict score allows a separate analysis of trade-offs between factors, highlighting potential conflicts across the landscape to increase transparency. Thus, users are allowed to decide on a threshold on how much conflict among factors should be allowed for areas to qualify as planning alternatives. Critical issues that will need further attention concern quality and availability of data, creation of representative spatial indicators for the factors, weighting methods, and uncertainty analysis. The REWIND framework is open-ended and allows for further development to provide planning support that gives more control of factors and conflicts to be acceptable in real-world planning. Capacity building involving stakeholders in the design of planning alternatives are crucial. In Sweden, it can promote a more proactive planning process in the municipalities, supported by the regional actors, leading to a more predictable permitting process for developers. This will be useful for inclusive wind power planning in any country, since it is applicable on different scales.

AB  - Biodiversity offsetting is a tool to balance ecological damage caused by human activity with new benefits created elsewhere. Offsetting is implemented by protecting, restoring or managing sufficiently large areas of habitat. While there are concerns about the true feasibility of offsetting, they are becoming a common policy tool world-wide. Operationally uncomplicated, quantitative approaches to spatial analysis of offsets are rare and their use is often restricted by the availability of suitable spatial data.
   We describe a practical method for offsets that builds upon two layers of relatively easily sourced spatial data, a balanced spatial priority ranking and a weighted range size rarity map. Together with (a) spatial information about impact and offset areas, and (b) extra parameters for the effectiveness of avoided loss and the amount of leakage expected, we can evaluate whether the proposed offset exchange represents a credible no net loss or net positive impact with an upward trade. The priority ranking and range size rarity maps can be produced in various ways, most notably using existing conservation planning tools. Here we used the standard outputs of the Zonation spatial prioritization software.
   We illustrate the method and associated visualization in the context of offsetting of boreal forests in Finland, where forests experience high and increasing pressures from forestry and bioenergy sectors. The example is timely as there is political demand for the uptake of biodiversity offset policies in Finland, and boreal forests are the most common biotope.
   The methods described here are applicable to biomes around the world. The described tools are made available as r scripts that utilize standard Zonation outputs, thus providing direct linkage to any past or future Zonation applications. As a limitation, the present methods only apply to avoided loss offsets.

AB  - Integration of biodiversity conservation into economic utilization of natural resources has become a central response to the challenges of sustainable development. However, the resources and competencies required to implement such an integrated strategy at the level of the individual, the organization, and the sector are not known. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed an approach to analyze responses of organizations to environmental change and evolving social demands for biodiversity conservation. We analyze the scale, scope, and distribution of the resources and competencies that support the delineation of ecologically significant habitats in intensively managed nonindustrial private forests in Finland, an important international actor in the sector. Based on a national survey of 311 foresters working in public agencies, private firms, and cooperative organizations, we investigate the division of labor in the sector and the patterns of investment in human capital, organizational resources, and information networks that support delineation. We find that communicating frequently with the actors who are directly engaged in field operations is consistently the most productive resource in conserving habitats. Our analysis identifies differences in competencies among different types of organizations, as well as distinct roles for public and private-sector organizations. Beyond identification of differences in conservation behavior and competencies among organizations, our analysis points to substantial uniformity in the sector. We attribute similarities in patterns of investment in conservation resources to historically structured central coordination mechanisms within the sector that include education, training, and broadly shared professional norms. These institutional structures and the resulting uniformity can be potential impediments to radical innovation. Our approach to analyzing adaptation to environmental change highlights the interplay between investments in competencies by actors within a particular technical domain and the evolving external institutional environment.

AB  - Decision making in forest planning often involves situations, where the value of the stand is dependent on its location or the properties of the stands nearby. Often the most intuitive tool to describe spatial objectives and outcomes is a visual map. However, evaluating and comparing different maps may prove a considerable cognitive burden, especially over large areas and in long-term planning. In this study, we investigate the use of value functions for eliciting spatial preference information from maps. Our case study is part of a project investigating the possibilities of increasing broadleaf-tree-dominated habitats in a northern Swedish landscape. The experts involved in the project evaluated maps showing different fragmentation patterns. Different spatial indices were then calculated for the maps, and expert evaluations were used to sketch value functions describing the preferred fragmentation level. The approach was found to be a quick way of translating spatial preferences into numerical values and conceptualizing the relatively abstract concept of fragmentation in the landscape. Furthermore, the results show that the choice of a certain fragmentation index has a crucial effect on the value function.

AB  - Due to global eco-social and technological challenges, a new strategy of planning adopted as the Land Use and Building Act in Finland (2000) will be renewed after 23 years of implementation. Will the forthcoming law recognise the complex relationships and consequences of self-organised processes, the digital empowerment of citizens, and the eco-social content of planning and development? This article examines and discusses the renewal of the Finnish Land Use and Building Act and the forthcoming planning system from an ontological perspective. Methodologically it is based on an assessment of the draft of and comments on the new Act, as well as on a comparative analysis of two case studies that illustrate the potential consequences of the renewal in the Finnish context. The results reveal that the planning system will become more complex. Despite the adoption of a new digital methodology, the Act ignores civil society's self-organisation and digital empowerment; also, the definition of the eco-social substance is vague. However, the Finnish reform serves as an example of the difficulties that planning systems encounter in the current context of complex problems concerning sustainability transitions all over the world.

AB  - Increasingly precise spatial data (e.g. high-resolution imagery from remote sensing) allow for improved representations of the landscape network for assessing the combined effects of habitat loss and connectivity declines on biodiversity. However, evaluating large landscape networks presents a major computational challenge both in terms of working memory and computation time. We present the ConScape (i.e. "connected landscapes") software library implemented in the high-performance open-source Julia language to compute metrics for connected habitat and movement flow on high-resolution landscapes. The combination of Julia's 'just-in-time' compiler, efficient algorithms and 'landmarks' to reduce the computational load allows ConScape to compute landscape ecological metrics-originally developed in metapopulation ecology (such as 'metapopulation capacity' and 'probability of connectivity')-for large landscapes. An additional major innovation in ConScape is the adoption of the randomized shortest paths framework to represent connectivity along the continuum from optimal to random movements, instead of only those extremes. We demonstrate ConScape's potential for using large datasets in sustainable land planning by modelling landscape connectivity based on remote-sensing data paired with GPS tracking of wild reindeer in Norway. To guide users, we discuss other applications, and provide a series of worked examples to showcase all ConScape's functionalities in Supplementary Material. Built by a team of ecologists, network scientists and software developers, ConScape is able to efficiently compute landscape metrics for high-resolution landscape representations to leverage the availability of large data for sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. As a Julia implementation, ConScape combines computational efficiency with a transparent code base, which facilitates continued innovation through contributions from the rapidly growing community of landscape and connectivity modellers using Julia.

AB  - Modern approaches to the definition of "hunting tourism" are analyzed in the article. It is proposed to consider hunting tourism as an organized paid trip aimed on satisfying the needs of consumers (hunters) in services of extreme, sports & recreational or cognitive character in the process of their staying in the natural habitat of hunting animals. The main problems of organizational, economic and orientation legal, which hinder the development of hunting tourism in Ukraine, are considered. The resource support of hunting tourism development in Ukraine is analyzed. Organizational and management aspects of hunting economy in European Countries (Germany, Sweden, Finland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland) are investigated. The directions for solving of basic problems of organizational and legal support, as well as incentives for further development of hunting tourism in Ukraine are offered. The basic principles on which hunting tourism should be based are formed, in particular: the principle of preservation of biodiversity in the animal and plant life of hunting grounds; the principle of sustainable ecologically balanced of using the hunting resources for tourism purposes; the principle of observance of ethical norms and national traditions in the process of organizing hunting tourism; the principle of preservation of the cultural heritage in the areas, which are reserved for the organization of hunting tourism; the principle of promoting the development of alternative types of hunting tourism; the principle of integration of hunting tourism with hunting, forestry and agrarian enterprises; the principle of state support in the development of hunting tourism.

AB  - This paper reviews the Finnish systems of aquaculture regulation and monitoring. The Finnish system differs from those found in most other European countries. The private ownership of the Finnish waters and shoreline, the regulation of water-related conflicts by the Water Act (and in special, independent Water Courts) and the abundance of private summer cottages on the Finnish coast are distinctive. A serious problem concerning consent compliance, apparently regarding statistical reliability, has occurred. This situation sends a strong signal about the need for better understanding, development and implementation of new types of environmental regulations for aquaculture in Finland. Methods for reducing the intensity of the conflict between environmental regulations and business objectives are presented in the conclusions. In the Finnish aquaculture system certain points could be enhanced to achieve better acceptability of the regulatory system by the different stakeholders. Among the measures suggested are regional planning, decision-making transparency and the employment of a more flexible regulatory system.

AB  - Context The habitat amount hypothesis has rarely been tested on plant communities. It remains unclear how habitat amount affect species richness in habitat fragments compared to island effects such as isolation and patch size.
   Objectives How do patch size and spatial distribution compared to habitat amount predict plant species richness and grassland specialist plant species in small grassland remnants? How does sampling area affect the prediction of spatial variables on species richness?
   Methods We recorded plant species density and richness on 131 midfield islets (small remnants of semi-natural grassland) situated in 27 landscapes in Sweden. Further, we tested how habitat amount, compared to focal patch size and distance to nearest neighbor predicted species density and richness of plants and of grassland specialists.
   Results A total of 381 plant species were recorded (including 85 grassland specialist species). A combination of patch size and isolation was better in predicting both density and richness of species compared to habitat amount. Almost 45% of species richness and 23% of specialist species were explained by island biogeography parameters compared to 19 and 11% by the amount of habitat. A scaled sampling method increased the explanation level of island biogeography parameters and habitat amount.
   Conclusions Habitat amount as a concept is not as good as island biogeography to predict species richness in small habitats. Priority in landscape planning should be on larger patches rather than several small, even if they are close together. We recommend a sampling area scaled to patch size in small habitats.

AB  - Large herbivores play a key role in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Cervidae (deer) population densities and community structure have undergone drastic changes in many parts of the world over the past decades, often with deer populations increasing. Many studies show impacts of Cervidae on multiple ecosystem properties, including vegetation and biodiversity, at local spatial scales. At larger spatial scales, however, impacts of changing Cervidae populations on forest ecosystems are less known. Although both abiotic and biotic dimensions contribute to shaping species' niches, abiotic variables are generally given prominence when modelling species habitats and ranges. This is despite biotic changes, including changes in trophic structure, being an important component of global environmental change. In this study, we examined the potential contribution of Cervidae densities to the habitat suitability for rare plant and lichen species across the temperate and boreal forests of Norway, where cervid densities have increased over the past 60 years. We also examined how these changes in herbivore communities may have shaped habitat suitability for rare lichens and plants and discuss the results in light of continuing shifts in herbivore assemblages. We ran habitat suitability models for 47 species of rare plants and lichens, which were selected based on herbivory reported as a criterion for placement on the national red list for species. Climate (temperature and precipitation), forest (forest type and productivity), soil pH and Cervidae densities (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) were used as independent variables. Densities of one or more of the three Cervidae species were inferred to be associated with the distribution of 14 (ten lichen, one bryophyte and three vascular plant species) of these 47 species. We found a range of habitat suitability associations with Cervidae densities, including positive, negative and hump-backed responses. Increases in Cervidae densities over the past 60 years may have led to different spatial trends in habitat suitability across the 14 species. Our results suggest that Cervidae densities are associated with the distribution of rare forest plant and lichen species differently at large spatial scales; experimental studies should test the causality of these associations. If causal, this implies that Cervidae management should find a balance between high and low densities to conserve several plant and lichen species. The preponderance of epiphytic lichens species, for which habitat suitability was associated with Cervidae densities, calls for field studies to focus on Cervidae impacts on forest lichens.

AB  - Local decision-makers face a wide range of pressures over questions of urban development. Among these is to pursue urban economic growth, while simultaneously responding to environmental demands to reduce car usage. There is, however, a lack of empirical studies analysing urban entrepreneurialism in conjunction with car-use reduction. This paper focuses on city-centre development and regulation of retail trade in two Norwegian cities. The underlying logic is that while compact city development and concentration of commerce in the urban core are ways to reduce car usage, there are also pressures drawing shopping to the city outskirts. The paper highlights the conflicting spatial interests involved in policies for car-use reduction, as evident in discussions as to how to regulate parking throughout the urban area. The paper also shows how municipal policy for car-use reduction is affected by private actors and neighbouring municipalities. Ultimately, the cases illustrate how local decision-making is influenced by the balance of pressures for and against environmental policy. In this way, analysis of inter-municipal competition over retail trade, inhabitants and investments, provides important insights into urban policy and practice.

AB  - Distribution of the Siberian flying squirrel Pteromys volans in northern Finland, at the edge of its global range, is fairly distinctive: the species is apparently absent in the western part of the region (Pohjanmaa), occurs regularly in the central part (Koillismaa), and only sporadically further east closer to the Russian border (northern Kainuu). In this study, we examined landscape structure in these three regions using geographic information system (GIS) and multi-source land use and cover data to identify key characteristics in landscape structure that are linked to the observed distribution pattern of the Siberian flying squirrel in northern Finland. We analysed landscape structure by studying habitat type proportions in nature reserves and in large-scale landscape samples within the regions. In addition, landscape configuration and connectivity were analysed within larger landscape sample plots. Our results suggest that the observed distribution pattern is associated with natural patterns in landscape structure at local and regional scales. Open peat lands, bogs and non-forested habitats dominate the landscape in the western part of the region and possibly account for the absence of the Siberian flying squirrel. More subtle differences between the central and eastern parts of the region indicate regional scale landscape responses of the species. The relatively high amount of spruce-dominated mixed forests in the central part was associated with the regular occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel, whereas the increasing dominance of pine forests towards the east was associated with the low number of sightings. Forest management history is much alike in the different parts of the region, but the effects of forest management on the actual range of the species cannot be estimated owing to a lack of knowledge on accurate population trends in northern Finland. However, human-caused fragmentation and large-scale habitat degradation may have long-term effects on the persistence of the species in northern. Finland.

AB  - Lithuania and Southern Sweden share similar natural conditions, but differ considerably in forest policies and management; thereby providing an opportune basis for comparative studies. Since the 1990s, Sweden has attempted to reduce the negative impact of its forest management on biodiversity, after decades of intensive production forestry. In contrast, Lithuania has been intensifying forestry practices associated with the post-soviet socio-economic transition. Here we assess the actual outcomes by comparing selected forest structure and composition variables known to be indicators for forest biodiversity; and estimate the prospective trends by scrutinising current forest policies and management.
   Our results indicate that Lithuanian forests consistently possessed higher rankings in six indices related to tree species composition, stand age, and deadwood quantities that are positively associated with forest biodiversity. The reverse is indicated by those data on stand age and tree diameter that are associated with centennial dynamics in forest utilisation intensity. With respect to policy instruments, Lithuania designates a substantially greater share of forest area to non-timber functions and legislates more severe management restrictions in forests targeting timber production. Concurrently, all estimates of forestry activities indicate more intensive forest management in Southern Sweden, including a higher share of artificial regeneration and shorter rotations. This allows concluding that, if current forest management practices persist, then an increased "biodiversity gap" may be expected between the two countries. The study concludes with discussing to what degree the identified trends are the direct product of targeted policies versus merely by-products of other factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We followed how forest thinning, repeated twice during a period of 93 years, altered understorey plant community composition, affected the succession of forest understorey vegetation and the accumulation of logs in the long-term. The study was carried out in northern Finland by resampling 20 permanent experimental plots, established after a wildfire in 1920. Understorey vegetation was inventoried in 1961, 1986 and 2013 with forest thinning treatments done in 1953 and 1987, using four and three different harvesting intensities, respectively. We found succession to override the effects of forest logging until the latest study period (2013). We observed negligible long-term effects of logging on understorey communities during the two mid-successional stages (1961, 1986), when the forest was 41 and 66 years old respectively. The impacts of logging on understorey vegetation were strongest in the latest successional stage (2013), the forest being at the age of 93 years. In the latest successional stage (2013) logged plots had less coarse woody debris than unlogged plots. Forest management thus influenced the key feature for forest biodiversity and potential habitats for endangered species. These findings are of major interest since the studies of long-term impacts of less intensive forest management practices are scarce. Our results suggest that in addition to possible immediate impacts, harvesting treatments have legacy effects (subtle or delayed inherited effects of forestry in the past) that influence the forest under storey vegetation community composition and the amount of coarse woody debris. This finding deserves special attention when planning of species conservation, multiple use of forests and sustainable forestry.

AB  - The loss of wetlands and semi-natural grasslands throughout much of Europe has led to a historic decline of species associated with these habitats. The reinstatement of these habitats, however, requires spatially explicit predictions of the most suitable sites for restoration, to maximize the ecological benefit per unit effort. One species that demonstrates such declines is the white stork Ciconia ciconia, and the restoration of habitat for this flagship species is likely to benefit a suite of other wetland and grassland biota. Storks are also being reintroduced into southern Sweden and elsewhere, and the a priori identification of suitable sites for reintroduction will greatly improve the success of such programmes. Here a simple predictive habitat-use model was developed, where only a small but reliable presence-only dataset was available. The model is based on the extent and relative soil moisture of semi-natural pastures, the extent of wetlands and the extent of hayfields in southern Sweden. Here the model was used to predict the current extent of stork habitat that is suitable for successful breeding, and the extent of habitat that would become suitable with moderate habitat restoration. The habitat model identifies all 10 occupied nesting sites where breeding is currently successful. It also identifies similar to 300 km(2) of habitat that is predicted to be suitable stork habitat, but that is presently unused; these sites were identified as potential areas for stork reintroduction. The model also identifies over 100 areas where moderate habitat restoration is predicted to have a disproportionate effect (relative to the restoration effort) on the area of suitable habitat for storks; these sites were identified as priorities for habitat restoration. By identifying areas for reintroduction and restoration, such habitat suitability models have the potential to maximize the effectiveness of such conservation programmes.

AB  - Finnish National Forest Inventory data and in particular multisource thematic maps were used as a mean to test different approaches to measure landscape characteristics and complexity as well as biodiversity indicators. We used wall-to-wall output thematic maps from the Finnish multisource National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI) to evaluate landscape level structure and composition of the Finnish forests. This work constitutes a first effort to estimate forest landscape structure, composition and habitat quality at a full national level. The use of MS-NFI maps with landscape metrics was proven as an efficient and novel method to monitor forest landscape structure and derive biodiversity indicators. In particular, the approach provides a useful tool for monitoring biodiversity when combined with georeferenced species information.

AB  - Spatial and temporal continuity of resources often benefits both ecological and economic goals in landscape management. Consideration of multiple and conflicting goals is also needed to view the future production possibilities of forests in successful forest management. Our aim was to estimate the production potential of a planning area in Finland by examining different forest management strategies from ecological and economic perspectives using long-term forest planning calculations. Economic objectives referred to timber production, whereas ecological objectives were based on suitable habitats for arboreal Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). Suitable habitats were defined using an empirical site-specific model, which includes a spatial variable reflecting the availability of habitat within an individual's activity area. Five alternative forest plans were worked out with different objectives for flying squirrel habitat and timber production. The alternative plans were compared with respect to values of objective variables at the end of the planning period of 60 years and against a production possibility frontier among net present value and flying squirrel habitat. Varying objective values in our analyses resulted from different utilization of production possibilities, and the changes were in line with the objectives used. The formation of flying squirrel habitat clusters in the landscape was enhanced, and it did not always incur severe reductions in harvestable timber volume. Possibilities to combine ecological and economic goals, both spatial and aspatial, in the planning process seems to be an encouraging alternative for the long-term forest management in the future.

AB  - Reintroductions can play a key role in the conservation of endangered species. Parasites may impact reintroductions, both positively and negatively, but few case studies of how to manage parasites during reintroductions exist. Bumblebees are in decline at regional and global scales, and reintroductions can be used to re-establish extinct local populations. Here we report on how the risks associated with parasites are being managed in an ongoing reintroduction of the short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, to the UK. Disease risk analysis was conducted and disease risk management plans constructed to design a capture-quarantine-release system that minimised the impacts on both the bumblebees and on their natural parasites. Given that bumblebee parasites are (i) generalists, (ii) geographically ubiquitous, and (iii) show evidence of local adaptation, the disease risk management plan was designed to limit the co-introduction of parasites from the source population in Sweden to the destination site in the UK. Results suggest that this process at best eliminated, or at least severely curtailed the co-introduction of parasites, and ongoing updates of the plan enabled minimization of impacts on natural host-parasite dynamics in the Swedish source population. This study suggests that methods designed for reintroductions of vertebrate species can be successfully applied to invertebrates. Future reintroductions of invertebrates where the parasite fauna is less well known should take advantage of next-generation barcoding and multiple survey years prior to the start of reintroductions, to develop comprehensive disease risk management plans.

AB  - 1. Climate change affects many ecosystems on earth. If not dying out or migrating, the species affected have to survive the altered conditions, including changes in community structure. It is, however, usually difficult to distinguish changes caused by a changing climate from other factors.
   2. Forestry is considered to be the major disturbance factor in Swedish forests. Here, we use forest lake data sets from 1996 and 2006 which include species abundance data for dragonfly larvae, water plant structure, forest age and forestry measures during a period of 25 years: from 1980 to 2005. Hence, we were able to discriminate between forestry effects and changes in species composition driven by recent climate change.
   3. We explored effects on regional species composition, species abundance and ecosystem functions, such as changes in niche use, utilising dragonflies (Odonata) as model organisms.
   4. Our results show that dragonflies react rapidly to climate change, showing strong responses over such a short time span as 10 years. We observed changes in both species composition and abundance; former rare species have become more frequent and now occur in lakes of a wider quality range, while former widespread species have become more selective in their choice of waters. The new communities harbour about the same number of species as before, but seen from a regional perspective, diversity is reduced.
   5. We predict that the altered species composition and abundance might raise new demands in conservation planning as well as altering the ecological functions of the aquatic systems.

AB  - In this article, we discuss cooperative networks for forest conservation from the viewpoint of deliberation. We ask how deliberative processes are produced and what predicts deliberation in the cooperative networks for forest conservation that have been established for policy implementation as a part of the Finnish forest biodiversity programme METSO. We base our argument on both qualitative and quantitative material. In the qualitative study, we present two cooperative networks for forest biodiversity conservation in Finland. The results show that clear leadership, active and determined work for common goals and openness to actively engage new actors assist in creating deliberative processes in cooperative networks. In the quantitative study, we explore the perceptions of implementers of METSO programme about the prerequisites for achievement in deliberation. The results of a quantitative study support those of a qualitative one: involving new forest owner groups and including conservation-biological knowledge were connected to perceived achievement. Based on the findings, we argue that in order to become as deliberative and empowering a programme as it has potential for, METSO needs to expose its actions to a broader public, critique and debate, involve new collaborators actively and support integration of various types of knowledge.

AB  - Societies have always been occupied with securing food supply and ensure environmental and human health. Scientific knowledge and technical level have, together with habitat and management patterns, shaped sanitation arrangements and recycling of resources. Because it is the same urban problems that are addressed by societies in different historical contexts, a longitudinal study may allow for novel ways to conjure food security and sanitation management issues in the present century. We trace the historical transition over two centuries away from a circular economy to a more linear one in two Swedish cities, the capital Stockholm and the industrial city Norrko & BULL;ping, and show that big but rather slow changes occurred more or less constantly in these two urban settings. The driving forces have changed from only improving local conditions of sanitation and food production over to global and regional driving forces in this century affecting what local communities can or could do. The ongoing globalization positions the subjects of environmental and human health, recycling and food security in a new global perspective, where climate change and global resource boundaries will play a central role. We cannot continue to rely on trade that causes rainforest destruction elsewhere or harmful chemical consumer products that lead to loss of biodiversity and human health risks. We need to put urban sanitation and food issues into this wider perspective with available remedial measures such as dietary changes, food waste reduction, soil less food production and building of new circular infrastructure. All urban areas in the world, including Stockholm and Norrko & BULL;ping in Sweden, need to adopt new strategies that again engage residents as well as public sectors and industry, including agriculture.

AB  - The scope of this paper is to present a landscape analysis which allows for the inclusion of dynamics through time and the cultural diversity of the landscape. Our method is to classify the physical landscape into area types based on the main forms of production in the agricultural society. This is combined with known historical sites, and the result is presented as maps representing different periods in time. We also generate character areas from modern land use and geological maps on the basis of the elements which dominate the landscape today. Finally, we combine the time images with the character areas to present functional units in a manner which includes time depth. The method is described through examples from a municipality in southern Norway (Notteroy). The method is useful for defining cultural environments for the purpose of area planning and conservation, and is applicable on a general level.

AB  - Conversion of boreal forest into agricultural land is likely to occur due to the shift of climatic zones and increasing food demand. However, any land conversion will affect the water balance and hence solute fluxes within the soil column and connected ecosystems. Understanding the consequences of land conversion on soil hydrology is essential to support an economically viable agriculture while minimizing its environmental footprint. Hydrological models can simulate these effects based on regionally adjusted climate scenarios. Here, we combined a local climate analysis with hydrological simulations (Hydrus-1D) of boreal soils before and after agricultural conversion. Historical climate analysis showed increasing temperatures and growing degree days while precipitation remains stable. Hydrological simulations revealed lower saturation and higher infiltration rates for unconverted soils, indicating lower runoff and increased infiltration and deep percolation. In contrast, agricultural soils have slower infiltration rates, particularly in the upper horizon. Over the long term, agricultural conversion consequently increases erosion risk and nutrient loss by runoff. This might further progressively limit groundwater recharge, affect hydrological processes and functions and future drought/flood conditions at catchment levels. Hence, conversion of boreal soils demands a primary identification of suitable areas to minimize its impacts.

AB  - This paper analyses urban densification in Norway as a key element of sustainable city policies. The city is viewed as a system in which changes of material aspects, such as density, are linked with social and technological aspects. Densification targets in Trondheim are used as a case study to explore the main actors and factors involved in urban development. A multilevel perspective approach used in sustainability transitions studies is applied as a model to describe them. The aim is to illustrate interactions and barriers arising in the implementation of densification policies. The argument suggests that despite a shift of paradigm in planning towards sustainability, urban regimes have remained rather stable. Some progress has been made, but further advancing the sustainability agenda may require new rules in the regime - for example, new planning policies integrated with taxation and financial instruments, and transport regulations - and a stronger emphasis on niche developments.

AB  - Recently, increased attention has been paid to the importance of everyday landscapes in the Western world, and a stronger political will to involve local participation in planning processes has emerged. The authors discuss the implementation of the political will to engage the Norwegian public in local heritage planning and whether or not this new role can have a mobilising effect on heritage protection. In Norway, cultural heritage managers have established methods for identifying valuable heritage assets in cultural historic landscapes. As increased responsibility for cultural heritage management is given to municipalities, more municipalities are making their own heritage plans to improve local heritage management. The article investigates how cultural heritage management in everyday landscapes is taking place, how heritage plans are developed, how local knowledge is involved, and what assets local residents appreciate in their environment, based on an in-depth study of two medium-sized Norwegian regional towns. The results show that local stakeholders were often invited to participate in planning processes, but that their contributions were largely kept out of official plans at the final stage. Further, the study revealed that memories and personal histories related to heritage appreciations are important elements in building identity, both at a personal level and at a local level.

AB  - Growth trends of animal farming pose a threat to water quality around the world. To find cost-efficient means to reduce nutrient loads from agriculture, detailed information on the abatement measures need to be incorporated in bioeconomic models. This study presents a theoretical framework that covers both animal and crop operations on farms. It describes the farmer decision making problem and incorporates nonlinear functions to capture the economic and biological aspects of the problem. The model is applied to Finnish dairy farms. The abatement cost functions are derived for nitrogen and phosphorus. Results indicate that abatement measures on fields should precede dietary changes.

AB  - Quantity depletion and quality deterioration issues arising from the extraction of groundwater have been discussed in previous studies. However, the literature reveals no systematic analysis of the possible social welfare losses due to the cost of both quantity depletion and quality deterioration. This paper therefore investigates the long run welfare cost of using groundwater for agriculture by including both quantity depletion and quality deterioration costs simultaneously. This is achieved through an empirical study of onion farmers in Sri Lanka who use groundwater for their cultivation. A significant social welfare loss is found in terms of both groundwater quantity and quality deterioration costs and which is likely to increase over the long run. This is shown to have important long run implications for land use management. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In striving for sustainability, urban policy and planning increasingly emphasize proximity ideals in order to go beyond established mobility- and speed-oriented accessibility strategies. Yet proximity is a fluid concept with many contextualized meanings, cutting across most sectors of urban planning. When proximity is realized in actual planning, clarity and communicability are therefore required. Here we explored how urban planners in different fields of expertise understand and apply the proximity concept. Furthermore, we tested a collaborative tool enabling transparent discussion and fostering a joint basis for further application. Qualitative data were collected via six semi-structured, focus-group workshops with 35 planners of various competencies working in three western Swedish municipalities. The results indicated that planning goals of proximity were negotiated according to three understandings: One derived from the established understanding of transportation and land-use integration, relying on planners' expert views; a second emphasizing the local community understanding, highlighting the social context of neighborhoods; and a third comprising the personal environment understanding of the individual's closest physical space at a detailed scale level. Collaborative exercises resulted in the development of a communicative tool for negotiating perceived understandings of proximity, as well as planning goals.

AB  - Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

AB  - The wolf (Canis lupus) is classified as endangered in Sweden by the Swedish Species Information Centre, which is the official authority for threat classification. The present population, which was founded in the early 1980s, descends from 5 individuals. It is isolated and highly inbred, and on average individuals are more related than siblings. Hunts have been used by Swedish authorities during 2010 and 2011 to reduce the population size to its upper tolerable level of 210 wolves. European Union (EU) biodiversity legislation requires all member states to promote a concept called favourable conservation status (FCS) for a series of species including the wolf. Swedish national policy stipulates maintenance of viable populations with sufficient levels of genetic variation of all naturally occurring species. Hunting to reduce wolf numbers in Sweden is currently not in line with national and EU policy agreements and will make genetically based FCS criteria less achievable for this species. We suggest that to reach FCS for the wolf in Sweden the following criteria need to be met: (1) a well-connected, large, subdivided wolf population over Scandinavia, Finland, and the Russian Karelia-Kola region should be reestablished, (2) genetically effective size (Ne) of this population is in the minimum range of Ne = 5001000, (3) Sweden harbors a part of this total population that substantially contributes to the total Ne and that is large enough to not be classified as threatened genetically or according to IUCN criteria, and (4) average inbreeding levels in the Swedish population are <0.1.

AB  - Solar power generation in Sweden is far from required capacity to help with transition towards 100% renewables in the power sector by 2040. Decentralized PV system attracts attentions given the conflicts of future increasing demands and land scarcity in the urban areas. However, it is not easy to implement it due to challenges on local conditions and lack of references.This paper aims to propose an overview of the potential of small-scale grid-connected PV systems in a Swedish context and offer an example for urban PV system planning in Sweden or high latitude areas. A model considering weather, space, infrastructures and economics is developed and implemented with a real case in the Swedish context.The findings verify the technical and economic feasibility of urban decentralized rooftop PV systems in the Swedish context. It is found that this kind of system does have considerable power potential in the Swedish context without land requirements. This kind of PV system could be a promising option for future power generation which satisfies part of demands and reduces pressure on external grids. The full potential could be only achieved with improved infrastructures, and the profitability of the system relies heavily on market and political conditions. This study can be a refence for other high latitude areas.

AB  - In this paper, I tell a story of the making of a regional biodiversity management plan. The plan is one example of the new modes of operation that are being tried out in order to build linkages from individual to collective action in the implementation of agri-environmental policy in Finland. I argue that in order to understand the role of these management plans in the policy process, we need to reinstate the practices that have produced them. In this article, I analyse experiences gained from Vehmaa, Southwest Finland. I analyse the planning process as a collective experimentation and systematically examine how human and non-human elements associate together in a policy process. By following the actors involved, I analyse how they create associations between heterogeneous elements and create the linkages between individual and collective action. I show how it is the mutability of the plan and its ability to move across the different scales that makes it a powerful device in agri-environmental policy. I argue, however, that regional planning has not been able to challenge the boundary between productive space and nature created by the modern intensive agricultural systems. Although the aim of the planning was to blaze a trail for biodiversity, the associations created around ecologically valuable sites ended up enforcing the rather limited interpretation of biodiversity offered by agri-environmental policy and offered only little capacity for farmers to act. I close the article by situating the case study within a wider context of rural sustainability and discussing possible other ways of associating agriculture, rural livelihood and biodiversity.

TI  - Water Transit and Ferry-Oriented Development in Sweden: Comparisons with System Trends in Australia
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Water transit is increasingly becoming an option for cities looking to expand their public transport network and provide an alternative to land-based transport congestion. But there are challenges in realising a functional urban ferry network, especially in Sweden which faces land use policy and weather-related constraints. This paper has three related aims: i) to compare the development of water transit in Swedish and Australian cities, ii) to compare changes in patronage over time, and iii) to analyze the role of ferry-oriented development (FOD) and planning policy effects on water transit development. Our approach is exploratory and comparative, and we use the cases of Stockholm and Gothenburg in Sweden with comparison to Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Patronage figures indicate that in both countries, water transit systems are a small part of the total public transport network, from 0.5% of total public transport trips in Stockholm to 3.7% in Brisbane. However, there has been modest growth in patronage that in relative terms has exceeded that of urban rail and bus services in all cities except Sydney. Integration of water transit with land use plans in FOD varies, with Brisbane and Sydney embarking on large-scale waterfront and transit plans focused on economic development. In Sweden integration with land use remains in early stages, with ad hoc terminal location and restrictive land use being limiting factors, especially in Stockholm. There are also conflicting strategies toward FOD in Gothenburg. Better conceptualization of land use implications for development of water transit planning is therefore suggested.

AB  - 1 We assessed the relative importance of habitat quantity, quality and isolation for the distribution and local abundance of two epiphytic lichens, Parmelina tiliacea, which is red-listed in Sweden, and the common Pleurosticta acetabulum. We predicted that habitat isolation should constrain the distribution of the mainly vegetatively dispersed P. tiliacea more than the sexually dispersed P. acetabulum.
   2 All patches of habitat containing suitable host trees for the study species were mapped from aerial, infra-red photographs. Presence and abundance of the lichens were recorded for a total of 3237 trees in 94 patches.
   3 Patch identity had strong influence on presence of both species on individual trees. Within patches, presence was positively correlated with tree size and was also influenced by tree species.
   4 At patch-level, species presence was positively correlated with tree number and negatively correlated with the proportion of the boundary that bordered coniferous forest and with isolation. Abundance was mostly correlated with tree size or with the number of large trees at tree- and patch-levels, respectively. For P. acetabulum, within-patch abundance was also influenced by isolation from other patches.
   5 Presence at patch-level was affected by isolation for both species, but this effect differed between the three isolation measures used. There was no clear evidence that the distribution of P. tiliacea was more constrained by isolation than that of P. acetabulum.
   6 Whilst this study emphasizes the importance of habitat quantity for species occupancy and local abundance, it shows that explanations of species occurrence in fragmented landscapes must also involve variables describing habitat quality and spatial configuration. Moreover it illustrates the difficulties in predicting species' occupancy from general knowledge about their dispersal traits.

AB  - Conflicts between opposing objectives of wildlife conservation and agriculture are increasing globally due to rising human food production and competition with wildlife over land use. Conservation conflicts are often complex and driven by variability and uncertainty in wildlife distribution and stakeholder wealth and power. To manage conflicts, empowering local stakeholders by decentralizing decisions and actions has been suggested to promote democratization and awareness of stakeholders. There is, however, a current gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment (e.g., farmers' and managers' practical, time or monetary resources) affects policy effectiveness. In this study, we apply an individual-based model of management strategy evaluation to simulate the conservation conflict surrounding protected and thriving common cranes (Grus grus) causing damage to agricultural production in Sweden and along the European flyways. We model the effect of farmer empowerment (i.e., increasing budgets to affect populations and agricultural production) in four management scenarios, in which we manipulate the availability and cost of two actions farmers may take in response to crane presence on their land: non-lethal (scaring) or lethal (culling) control. We find that lower budgets lead to increases in population size due to increased use of less costly scaring instead of shooting. Higher farmer budgets lead to increased population extinction risk. Intermediate budgets allow farmers to control the population size around the management target and limit impact on agricultural production to intermediate levels. Our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders, and particularly their power to implement effective actions, needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting management targets and strategies. Further, our results show that empowering individual farmers has the potential to contribute to conflict management and to balance agricultural with conservation objectives, but increased stakeholder involvement also requires careful planning and monitoring.

AB  - Forecasting the potential impacts of forest policies on species of special conservation value is a prerequisite for safeguarding forest biodiversity. In this study, regional forest policy scenarios were compared in terms of predicted habitats suitable for the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). To derive both patch- and landscape-scale models to predict species presence in a forest stand, species occurrence data from a systematic field survey covering the whole distribution area of the flying squirrel in Finland and Multi-Source National Forest Inventory data were combined. Then, the Finnish forestry model MELA and the derived occupancy models were applied to predict the quantity of suitable habitats for flying squirrels in three different 50-year policy scenarios. The results confirm that increasing the utilization of felling potential from the level of business-as-usual to the level stated as policy targets in regional forest programs decreases the amount of suitable habitat in the future. However, regional forest programs had a less drastic impact on habitats than maximum sustainable removal, except in two regions. It should be noted that the occupancy models seemed to fail on sites that experts deem to be most suitable for the species. Obviously, there are other factors than forest management affecting presence.

AB  - During the 1990s many European cities, including the Norwegian cities, stressed image building as cultural cities. Growth in the so-called "cultural economy" is strongly linked to a need in the post-industrial towns for new businesses. Culture has been viewed as an instrument for economical development and is used as a strategy to rejuvenate city centres. This includes a wide spectrum of creative activities, and a new interest for active use of cultural heritage assets in the image building of towns and cities has developed. Heritage has been ascribed a new role in the process of revitalising city centres. Based on empirical studies in two Norwegian towns the paper discusses whether this renewed interest has set marked stamps on the urban environments or whether it has a more superficial character in an attempt to keep up with international trends.

AB  - Four watersheds, each characterized by a major resource use were selected for the study: The Vistula River in Poland-agriculture: the Dalalven River in Sweden-forestry: the Archipelago Sea in Sweden, Finland, Estonia-tourism: and the Lake Peipsi in Estonia/Russia-fisheries/agriculture. The main objective was to examine the reactions of particular ecosystems within the Baltic Sea drainage area, and to assess sustainability conditions on the regional level.
   The degree of sustainability and impact on the Baltic Sea were investigated through workshops and seminars in the areas. Overviews of environmental and socio-economic conditions were succinctly summarized in commissioned papers. Interventions by and discussions with scholars, sector experts, administrators and stakeholders of the various sites laid the foundation for conceptualizing the interaction of natural and human forces for each case. The project was able to draw quite a number of conclusions, summarized as the following lessons learnt.
   In the Vistula Region, nutrient emissions have levelled off but shortage of freshwater is critical. Forestry in the Dalalven watershed is largely environmental-friendly, except for fragmentation of the landscape and its negative impact on biodiversity. In the Archipelago area a former low-energy community has been replaced by a leisure time society. Different types of tourism is developing, but despite this variety, an improved integration of ecological properties with socio-economic patterns is required in order to build a sustainable, living Archipelago. The lake Peipsi basin and the surrounding area suffer both from problems of resource management and economic backwardness. Parts of the local economy has lost access to the one time large Soviet market, although the Estonian side has apparently benefited from present economic growth. To cope with the division of the lake, a regime for transnational management is unfolding. It is based on both informal and. to an increasing extent, agreed professional contacts.
   Networks of engaged people were in all sites a resource for and promoter of the sustainability path. In order to succeed and to maintain the zeal. they need strong institutional support and common goals. Public programmes in the Baltic, ie. the work of the Helsinki Commission and Baltic Agenda 21, have developed instruments to enhance sustainability beneficial for the management of these watersheds. But critical tasks retrain to be done in developing a shared understanding of ways to improve management of ecosystems with social factors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stormwater ponds are beneficial to urban landscapes because these man-made systems can reduce the negative effects of flooding in urban areas and restrain the distribution of pollutants. In addition, these systems are especially important to maintain the biodiversity of urban landscapes. Here, we sampled a set of 18 stormwater ponds in the city of Uppsala in Sweden to test the relationship between beta diversity of adult dragonflies and environmental factors (local and land use variables). We analysed the total beta diversity and its two components: replacement and richness difference. We recorded 31 species of Odonata, comprising 61% of the Odonata species in the province of Uppland in Sweden. By itself, this result indicates the importance of stormwater ponds in contributing to biodiversity in urban areas. The richness difference component of beta diversity was higher than the replacement component. Results from generalized dissimilarly models indicated that the richness difference component was mainly related with pond area and total vegetation cover (aquatic vegetation plus vegetation surrounding ponds). Focusing on different vegetation variables separately, models indicated that the beta diversity components were significantly correlated with percentage cover of floating algae scums, emergent aquatic macrophytes and tall shore vegetation. These results are consistent with what is known about the ecology of dragonflies, including the importance of aerial plant structures for perching, shelter from terrestrial and aquatic predators, and for providing oviposition sites. We also found that the stormwater ponds harboured a large part of the regional species pool. These systems are therefore important havens of biodiversity in urban landscapes. Our results also indicate that the management of different types of vegetation is key to maximize the potential of these systems in maintaining regional biodiversity.

AB  - As urban areas are developing and becoming increasingly important for dealing with sustainability goals and challenges, it is of the essence not to overlook the impacts created by the local, small-scale processes taking place across metropolitan regions. Based on a case study conducted in the expansive Stockholm region, this study explores the challenges associated with linking small-scale development to long-term overall strategy and development in municipal spatial planning. More specifically, it explores planning practitioners' experiences of how local planning processes are organized to deal with established cross-cutting sustainability goals and the conditions for promoting sustainability in small-scale development projects. The results show that municipal planners face several organizational, procedural, and knowledge-related challenges that also influence the interplay between public and private actors in the process. To promote suStainable trajectories at the local level, it is necessary to devote resources and build capacity to further develop the relationship and interdependency between the processes of translation and formalization, which constitute an important link between the project-specific planning process and the overall strategy and development.

AB  - The sustainability aspects of land use were assessed with an environmentally extended input-output model of Finland in 2002. The main economic industries and products causing land use were identified and the impacts were estimated with three indicators: biocapacity, human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) and ecosystem degradation potential (EDP). The results correlated well with expert assessments on the threats to biodiversity, although the influence of animal farming was not clear in all indicators. Most of the domestic land use was caused by final demand outside Finland. Based on a simplified trade balance, Finland was a net exporter of land area, mainly through wood products. Two thirds of the domestic land use was driven by export production. Therefore a regional consumption based approach is not sufficient to mitigate and control the environmental impacts of land use even in a developed country like Finland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper reports on the methodology and findings of a recent project on behalf of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management. The Ministry is seeking procedures for combining ecological and economic criteria to assess which technical urban water alternatives shall receive funding. To this end the current decision making process (DMP) for implementing urban water alternatives in Austria has been analyzed and compared with the situation elsewhere, e.g. in Sweden. The DMP entails specific requirements on assessment, whence the most common decision aid methodologies, ranging from LCA-based to multi-criteria methods, have been described and evaluated from an environmental, economic, legal and practical point of view, turning out recommendations to the Ministry. Their main points are: First the DMP should be kept as simple as possible in order to make it transparent. Second the aggregation of different criteria groups should and can be avoided. Therefore the stakeholders should not be allowed to make trade-offs. Finally clear objectives need to be stated.

AB  - As a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), South Africa is obliged to ensure that CBD objectives are met. Fundamental to the concept of biodiversity are the different levels of biological organization ranging from landscapes to genes. Historically, biodiversity conservation has predominantly focussed on species, while southern African nature reserves were generally not established with biodiversity criteria under consideration. This paper describes an integrative approach to conserving and managing all levels of biodiversity in Gauteng, the smallest province in South Africa. Utilizing land cover and vegetation maps for the province, higher level biodiversity considerations will incorporate principles of landscape ecology together with gap analysis and iterative techniques, while lower level biodiversity considerations will involve the assessment of the status and distribution of Red Data plant species in the province. As the final output, a map will be created within a Geographic Information System depicting priority conservation areas with associated broad management recommendations. A landscape mosaic with simple management guidelines for landowners will attempt to facilitate the conservation of landscape processes.

AB  - Global climate change, rapid urbanization, and drastic economic development pose many threats and challenges to humanity, increasing the necessity for sustainable human development, urban ecological management, and low-carbon transformation. The current studies on urban management model are relatively scattered, while most of them focus on one-dimensional and problem-oriented measures. Firstly, we review the history of urban ecological management's development, including four stages, i.e., the germination, transitional, formative, and prosperity stage, and summarize the concepts related to eco-cities. Then, we present a comparative analysis of the typical urban ecological management models worldwide, with a focus on Singapore's garden city, Japan's zero-waste city, Britain's low-carbon city, Brazil's green state capital, Australia's eco-city, Finland's eco-city development projects, and the United States' comprehensive management. Three other typical models from Sweden, Germany, and Denmark are presented. The experiences and lessons from these urban ecological management models are further discussed. Finally, a new and comprehensive management framework is proposed, incorporating the five perspectives of urban planning, industrial transformation, organizational model, environmental protection, and institution system. The framework can provide a scientific basis for the refinement of urban ecological mangement. All the analysis and conclusions will contribute to the academic research and practical operations regarding low-carbon transformation and regional sustainable development.

AB  - The Hieracium flora of westernmost Dalarna, comprising the southern fringe of the Scandes alps (central Scandinavia), is extremely rich in species. The area is dominated by species-poor coniferous sub-alpine and taiga forest, but within this matrix there are small and isolated sites with high species richness of both Hieracium and other plants. Both steep mountain slopes with outcrops of base-rich bedrock and moving ground water, and old seasonal or permanant human settlements constitute such biodiversity hotspots. However, today the former are threatened by modern forestry practices and/or exploitation for winter tourism and the latter are commonly abandoned and subjected to severe overgrowth or dramatically changed land-use. The area was thorougly surveyed in 1897-1921. In 2007, the same region and partly the same sites, were revisited. In 1897-1921, 15 Hieracium species were on average recorded from each site, but when the same sites were revisited in 2007 significantly fewer, only about 6 (40%) species per site, were refound. As far as the total species pool of the study area is concerned, it consisted of 168 species in 1897-1921, whereof only 117 (67%) were found in 2007. This remarkable reduction in species richness at both the local and the regional scale is attributable to both modern forestry practices and to the cessation of traditional agricultural practices like hay-making on semi-natural grasslands and extensive cattle-grazing in the forests. It is concluded that to reduce the on-going severe loss of biodiversity in the sub-alpine and taiga regions, conservation efforts in these areas ought to be enhanced and concentrated not only on saving what still remains of old-growth forest but also on managing remnants of grasslands and formerly grazed or mowed open forests around former settlements.

AB  - This essay analyses the design of Stockholm Metro in Sweden, focusing on its planning and design of public art. Under special cultural background, Stockholm Metro has its own comprehension of public art and design. The design has successfully solved problems by giving vivid guidance to passengers in several ways: the use of colour decoration in stations, personalized designs of spaces and the changes of passengers' sensory focuses, which are valuable to improve the management and the transportation quality of Metro in China.

AB  - A regional geochemical sampling program of stream waters has been carried out in the Nord-Trondelag region of central Norway. This area has hitherto been little affected by regional anthropogenic sources of pollution. Hydrochemical trends appear to be dominated by interplay of two main factors: (i) input of sea salts via marine aerosols in precipitation: and (ii) geological sources (mineral weathering). Factor (i) results in a predominance of Na-Cl waters near the coast, and may also be partially responsible (via proton displacement from soil ion-exchange sites by marine cations) for lower pH values in near-coastal waters. Further inland, the importance of marine salts decreases and waters become dominantly Ca-(Na)-HCO3 Sub-regional anomalies in geochemical maps for, e.g. nitrate and copper may indicate anthropogenic sources for these parameters from agriculture or mining activities.

AB  - Changes in landscape over a period of 50 years were analysed in a rural area of 324 ha in Central Finland. The data were digitized from aerial photographs of the National Land Survey taken in 1944, 1959, 1979 and 1991, and analysed with the IDRISI (TM) geographic information system (GIS). The average proportion of land in agricultural use in the sample area was 17.4%.
   The arable area declined from the maximum of 62.3 ha (1959) to 47.6 ha. The total length of linear landscape elements, predominantly ditch bank habitats, halved, from 876 m/ha of field (1944) to 449 m/ha by the end of the period. The average rate of loss of field boundary habitat was 9.1 m/ha/ year. At the same time, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity of agricultural landscape elements dropped from 0.37 to 0.24. The number of field parcels declined by 29%, and the mean parcel size increased by 45%, from 1.2 ha to 1.7 ha. The index value of the fractal dimension measuring the complexity of parcel shapes also fell, from 1.88 (1959) to 1.86 (1991).
   The change in spatial structure reflects the intensification of farming in Finland. Biodiversity at ecosystem level has clearly declined. However, the implications for the agroecosystem and its sustainability are still unknown.

AB  - This comparative study is based on structured interviews with farmers participating in the agri-environment schemes in Estonia and Finland. It explores farmers' interest in and knowledge of farmland wildlife, their understanding of the concept of biodiversity, and awareness of the potential causes behind declines of farmland birds. It also examines the relationship between farmers' interest and willingness to undertake practices favouring farmland wildlife. Estonian and Finnish farmers showed considerable interest in wildlife on their farms, which was only weakly related to the self-assessed knowledge of wildlife. Many farmers viewed biodiversity from a narrow perspective often excluding species directly related to farming. Finnish farmers expressed more concern about the decline in common farmland species than Estonian ones. In both countries farmers rated intensification of agriculture as the major driving force behind farmland bird declines. The expressed interest in wildlife positively correlated with willingness to undertake wildlife-friendly measures. Only farmers with agri-environment contracts targeted specifically at biodiversity enhancement were more knowledgeable about practical on-farm activities favouring wildlife, and were more willing to employ them than the rest. Estonian farmers expressed a high degree of willingness to enhance wildlife though agri-environment management, which is a good sign for better implementation of the recently established national programme towards conservation.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is one of the most studied topics in ecology but our knowledge is still limited particularly concerning matrix effects on species distribution in a human-dominated landscape. We tested the ability of random sampling hypothesis, colonization-extinction dynamics and matrix-related concepts to explain the variation in species richness, total bird density and community composition in old-forest bird assemblages in two contrasting landscapes. We collected data on breeding bird abundances from 66 old-growth forest reserves in NE Finland and six larger areas in adjacent Russian Karelia using the line transect method. In Finland, protected old-forest patches are embedded in a matrix dominated by young regeneration stands. In Russia, study areas were situated in continuous, old forest dominated landscapes. Bird assemblages in old-forest patches embedded in human-modified matrix in Finland were not random samples from Russian bird assemblages. In the Finnish assemblages, species richness was lower and total bird density higher. Species richness declined with increasing distance (isolation) to Russia. Bird assemblages in large forest reserves in Finland close to Russia were structurally more similar to assemblages in the continuous reference landscape than those in small and more distant reserves. The results support the idea that several mechanisms related to colonisation-extinction dynamics and to matrix resource availability influence species distribution in fragmented landscapes but in species-specific ways. We conclude that even though small and isolated protected areas may foster high relative bird species density their ecological integrity is compromised, and therefore, improving matrix quality around reserves may lead to considerable conservation benefits.

AB  - The herbaceous understory forms the richest stratum in temperate broadleaved forests in terms of plant diversity. Understanding the process of understory succession is thus of critical importance for the development of management guidelines for biodiversity restoration in post-agricultural plantation forests.
   We studied effects of stand age, forest fragmentation, and soil and canopy conditions on species richness and abundance of four species groups in the understory of post-arable oak plantations in southern Sweden: herbaceous forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-land species, and woody species.
   The group of forest specialists may approach the richness of continuously forested sites after 60-80 years in non-fragmented plantations, but many forest species were sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Open-land species richness decreased during succession, while the richness of woody species and of generalists remained stable, and was not affected by fragmentation. Abundance of generalists gradually decreased in non-fragmented plantations, probably due to competition from colonizing forest specialists. Soil pH in post-arable stands remained consistently higher than in continuously forested stands, which maintained differences in species composition. The development of a shrub layer seemed to imply a competitive advantage for forest specialists compared to generalist species.
   For successful recovery of a rich understory, we suggest that post-arable plantations should be established on loamy soils of intermediate to high pH proximate to older forest with source populations, and that a continuous overstory canopy cover of 70-80% is maintained by regular light thinnings and promotion of a shrub layer.

AB  - Question
   To what extent do historical and present-day management regimes and landscape characteristics affect the functional structure of semi-natural grassland communities?
   Location
   Semi-natural grasslands, the Baltic island of oland, Sweden.
   Methods
   We assessed community functional structure within 475 (50cmx50cm) semi-natural grassland vegetation plots using two indices: community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and functional divergence (FD), calculated using the Rao quadratic entropy index. Spatially explicit regressions were used to assess the extent to which the CWM and FD for different plant traits are explained by past and present levels of local grazing management, and the present and historical characteristics of the surrounding landscape.
   Results
   Across traits, the CWM and FD of individual grasslands were strongly associated with current grazing intensity, but also with local management history and past landscape structure.
   Conclusions
   Our results indicate that grassland functional structure in the fragmented present-day landscape reflects not only present conditions, but also the historical context of the grassland fragments - where the presence of extensive grassland habitat in the surroundings provided a diverse pool of grazing-tolerant species. The study also suggests that information on landscape history, and its effects on the local species pool, may improve predictions of future plant community structure.

AB  - While the twentieth century was dominated by private car usage, shifts towards more sustainable urban mobility, to mitigate environmental damage and increase health benefits, are now taking place. In Scandinavia, several car-free street experiments take form, that span from permanent car-free inner-city plans (i.e. Oslo) to temporary interventions (i.e. pop-up plaza and parklets) to shift the use of urban settings and infrastructures from motorised traffic towards spaces for people and social interactions. Specifically, in Sweden, transitory car-free street experiments (i.e. summer streets) are developed with the purpose of creating novel mobility patterns and uses of public spaces that enhance social inclusion and quality of life. Despite Swedish municipalities' monitoring of these interventions, very little is known about which physical parameters (i.e. environmental qualities) and psychosocial processes (i.e. emotional relation with places) affect people's acceptance and place usability during car-free initiatives. Following the guidelines proposed by the European Commission, this paper focuses on residents' perception of car-free street experiments. The aim is to identify how acceptance and usability of car-free street experiments might vary depending on the perceived qualities of the physical urban settings and on interceding psychosocial processes such as, neighborhood attachment and perceived quality of life. An interdisciplinary methodology of investigation merging knowledge from the field of environmental psychology, landscape architecture, urban transport and planning was applied on four case studies in Sweden. Results suggest that psychosocial processes of place attachment and quality of life are relevant in order to understand the level of acceptance towards car-free streets implementations.

KW  - COASTAL
AB  - Renewable energy and sustainable food production are high on the international agenda, as is the prospect of expanding activity northwards to Arctic waters. In this article, we review core elements of the marine governance systems for aquaculture facilities and offshore wind farms in Norway and Scotland. Management of these sectors through strategic planning, marine spatial planning and licensing systems furthers rule of law values such as stability and predictability, making investment less risky. The review illustrates how the governance systems also facilitate flexibility and adaptability, balancing predictability considerations against the need to adapt management to natural and economic changes and innovative technologies, or even effective multi-use. This article discusses what endeavours have been made to strike a balance between predictability and adaptability in these sectors in Norway and Scotland. This study of marine management regimes in the Arctic and northern parts of the Temperate Northern Atlantic, and the values underpinning these regimes, provides lessons for the future of the Arctic.

AB  - ICZM (Integrated Coastal Zone Management) is a decision-making process for sustainable use, development and protection of coastal marine areas and their resources, in continuous realization. Norway is currently dependent upon the commitment and motivations of the municipalities to fulfill its ICZM initiatives. These communities are lacking epistemic communities that can help prevent the simmering conflicts surrounding aquaculture expansion, as demonstrated by media data from 1984-2010. With the forthcoming harvest of the zooplankton redfeed in Norwegian and surrounding waters, the Aquaculture industry could be in a situation of expanded feed resources. which would ensure its expansion if localities are made available. This would also be in line with the Norwegian government's commitment to the expansion of this industry. A government-endorsed growth of the Aquaculture industry will add fuel to these simmering conflicts concerning the use of the eco-system of collective goods and services available along national coastline in Norway for Aquaculture purposes. The suggestions from the recently released report from the Select Committee appointed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs in Norway on Effective and Sustainable Area Use in the Aquaculture Industry cab be an aid to supporting the growth of epistemic communities and a subsequent successful national ICZM implementation, thereby paving the way for a conflict-less coastal area management.

AB  - This paper presents a futures study of international forest trends. The study, produced as part of the Swedish Future Forest program, focuses on global changes of importance for future Swedish forest use. It is based on previous international research, policy documents, and 24 interviews with selected key experts and/or actors related to the forest sector, and its findings will provide a basis for future research priorities. The forest sector, here defined as the economic, social, and cultural contributions to life and human welfare derived from forest and forest-based activities, faces major change. Four areas stand out as particularly important: changing energy systems, emerging international climate policies, changing governance systems, and shifting global land use systems. We argue that global developments are, and will be, important for future Swedish forest use. The forest sector is in transition and forest-, energy, climate-and global land use issues are likely to become increasingly intertwined. Therefore, the. forest sector. must be disembedded and approached as an open system in interplay with other systems.

AB  - This essay is about the role of ecologists in policy-determining and, decision-making processes in the society in which research results may play, and are expected to play, a constructive role. The incentive for writing this essay came from my,involvement, over the past several years, in the research-and conservation-planning of boreal forest biodiversity in Finland. Forest biodiversity is a much,debated issue in Finland, where forest industry represents an important sector of the economy and has become so advanced technologically and in terms of the infrastructure that:the ever-diminishing work force can manage the entire area of 20 million ha of forests - practically down to single big trees. Biodiversity has become a fundamental concern in boreal forestry, because this is an industry that is based on the use of just a few species, but in a manner that will influence thousands of non-target species living in the same area. Arguably, current boreal forestry as practiced in e.g. Finland is sustainable from the perspective of the dynamics of the target tree species, but-not from the perspective of the forest communities as a whole.

AB  - Fragmentation may occur simultaneously in different spatial and temporal scales. The ecological importance of fragmentation depends both on the scale of fragmentation and on the habitat requirements of the species. The fragmentation of old-growth forests is regarded as one of the most important causes for the recent decline of several forest-dwelling species in Fennoscandia. In Fennoscandia landscape-level fragmentation has proceeded differently in various areas. For example, in eastern Finland mature forest fragmentation was evident very early. By the 1800's, only one third of the landscape was covered by 150 yr old forests. This early fragmentation resulted mostly from the slash-and-burn cultivation practised widely in these areas. In the northern Fennoscandia, however, no such landscape changes have been found before the 1900s. During the 1900's fragmentation has accelerated. Recent results suggest that biological impacts of current landscape-level fragmentation of mature forests may have been overestimated, especially among invertebrate species. Specific habitat requirements of these groups are still poorly known. Instead of requiring mature forests, several wood-associated threatened species may require only dead wood that can occur in any successional stage in both managed and protected areas. Such variability in the habitat requirements allows good opportunities for preservation of the threatened species. Results from current research indicate the need to restore and recreate natural fire-originated early successional stages where the amount of coarse woody debris is high. Promotion of coarse woody debris in young managed forests is potentially a very effective way to sustain populations of several threatened wood-associated species.

AB  - Changes in Collembola richness and diversity along a land-use intensity gradient were studied in eight European countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland, Hungary, UK, Ireland and Finland). In each country a set of six 1 km(2) (and-use units (LUUs) were selected forming a gradient ranging from natural forest to agricultural dominated landscapes, passing through mixed-use ones. In addition to data on Collembola, detailed information regarding landscape diversity and structure was collected for each LUU. A total of 47,774 individuals were identified from 281 species. Collembola reacted not only to changes in the diversity of the landscape, but also to the composition of that diversity and the area occupied by each land-use type at each LUU. Although species richness patterns were not concordant among the different countries, the total number of species per LUU (landscape richness) was generally higher in natural forests and mixed-used landscapes, and lower in agricultural dominated landscapes. Moreover, high richness and diversity of Collembola at each LUU were associated with a diverse landscape structure, both in terms of number of patches and patch richness. Despite this comparable species richness between mixed-use landscapes and those dominated by natural forests, average species richness on forested areas (local richness) decreased along the gradient, showing that forest patches on mixed-use landscapes support a lower richness than in landscapes dominated by forest. This aspect is important when addressing the role of native forests in structuring biodiversity in disturbed and fragmented landscapes. Although a diverse Landscape can support a high biodiversity, the results suggest that intensive fragmentation should be avoided with the risk of collapsing local species richness with the consequent result for regional biodiversity.

AB  - Trails are significant features in landscapes, and many ancient pathways have developed into routes of great importance for recreation and tourism in contemporary societies. Nevertheless, international research on recreational trails has hitherto mainly focused on managerial and environmental aspects of trails and less on trails from a social science perspective, such as conflict management. This study explores the role of recreational trails as a potential tool for managing conflicts in a multifunctional landscape. The findings originate from a case study of the southern Jamtland mountain region in Sweden, an area where land-use conflicts exist and where tourism is a major concern. The study examines the recreational trail as an applied example where actors in the mountain landscape negotiate and collaborate. through the recreational trail, dialogue and discussions are made possible among stakeholders. Findings show that trails can function as facilitators for communication and can thus enhance the possibilities of building trust and promoting collaboration between actors. This research contributes to the existing literature on handling multiple land-use interests and adds to previous knowledge by taking on a rather new approach, where the recreational trail becomes a facilitator for communication.

AB  - Due to increasing anthropogenic habitat alteration, fragmentation, and loss, the analysis of how, when, and why animals select particular habitats has become a central issue in ecology and biogeography. Animals adapt to spatiotemporal variability in resources either by tracking these resources or by plasticity in behavior to cover their needs, leading to three important implications: movement, temporal variation, and individual trade-offs leading to intra-species variability, all of which are directly linked to the use of space by animals. Based on GPS-tracking of domesticated reindeer in southern Norway, the authors addressed these issues by analyzing movement patterns and space use simultaneously across different temporal and organizational scales. Emerging information about the space use by reindeer was found explicitly linked to scaling relations, reflecting the matter of scale as having important functional implications rather than solely being a technical question of extent and resolution. Adding movement into the analysis of space use further advances the necessary functional perspective on space use. The authors conclude that scaling not only space but also time and the organizational level, in combination with accounting for different behavioral states, brings biogeography closer to a process-based view, rather than solely pattern-based view.

AB  - The Norwegian government recently agreed on the goal 30by40, which involves opening Norwegian offshore areas to host 30 GW of installed wind power by 2040. We address this goal by presenting a first mapping of wind power suitability scores (WPSS) for the entire Norwegian economic zone (NEZ) using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework (MCDA), namely, the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) approach. We obtain WPSS considering relevant criteria like wind resources, techno-economic aspects, social acceptance, environmental considerations, and met-ocean constraints such as wind and wave conditions. The results starts with a baseline scenario, where the criterion importance is pairwise compared in the context of balancing economic incentives and conflicting interests. Additionally, to reveal regions that are robust to changes in criterion importance, we carry out a sensitivity analysis by introducing three additional scenarios. These scenarios represent stereotypical actors with distinct preferences for siting of wind farms: the investor, the environmentalist, and the fisherman. The results show that the southern part of the NEZ is the most suitable and robust region for offshore wind power deployment. This region receives the highest suitability category ("very high" suitability for wind power application) throughout all the scenarios. Areas in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea and the near-coastal areas outside mid-Norway are also well suited regions, but these are more sensitive to the choice of criterion importance. The use of AHP within the framework of MCDA is shown to be a promising tool for pinpointing the best Norwegian offshore areas for wind power application.

AB  - It is important to consider the preferences of the various stakeholders involved when evaluating effective reserve selection, since it is largely their preferences that determine which of a given set of potential reserve networks that actually is "the best". We interviewed eight conservation planners working at the county administrative boards in each of the eight administrative counties covering boreal Sweden to establish weightings for different structural biodiversity indicators by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The subjective weightings were applied in a reserve selection model based on a goal programming (GP) approach. The structural indicators were derived from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) and used as proxy for biodiversity potential. A biodiversity indicator score, based on the values of those indicators, was maximized. The model adjusted this score ensuring that all indicators were represented in the selection, and further also adjusted the influence of the indicators based on the subjective weightings. We evaluated the GP approach by comparing it to a simple linear programming (LP) formulation, only maximizing the indicator richness. In all cases the model was limited either by a budget or an area. The biodiversity potential in young forests are often neglected within present conservation policies, however, the proportion of selected forest under 15 years was relatively high in all our cost-effective cases, varying between 32% and 60% using the individual planners subjective weightings, compared to 80% when using a simple LP model. The proportion of selected forest over 100 years varied between 69% and 85% in the area-effective cases using the subjective weightings, compared to 80% when using a simple LP model. Middle-aged forest was not favored in any of the selections, although they make up a substantial part of the total area. We conclude that there are differences in how conservation planners prioritize the indicators, and depending on how specific biodiversity indicators are weighted the age distribution of the selected reserves differs. This demonstrates the importance of considering how to establish appropriate weightings. It is also important to consider the, at least in our case, substantial difference in how common the different indicators are to ensure that the weightings get their intended impact on the selections.

AB  - The conservation of biodiversity in aquatic habitats has become an increasingly important challenge in the management of water resources. In addition to the complexity of the lake fishery and the management structure, the popularity of gill net fishing, in particular, has brought problems when re-establishing populations of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), collecting genetically sustainable numbers of spawners of the land-locked salmon, Salmo salar nl. sebago (Girard), and increasing the population of the Saimaa ringed seal, Phoca hispida saimensis (Nordq.) to a sustainable level in the Vuoksi watercourse, south-east Finland. The attitudes towards protection among the users and other interested parties vary. In order to enhance the coexistence of the lake fishery and endangered species over large water areas, improved institutional linkages are needed among the local, regional and governmental levels of the fragmented decision-making regime. Environmental interests should also be integrated into the communication structure.

AB  - Species ranges are expected to move polewards following the changing climate, which poses novel challenges to the protected area network, particularly at northern latitudes. Here we study how well protected areas are likely to sustain populations of birds of conservation concern under a changing climate in northern Europe, in Finland. We fitted bioclimatic envelope models generated for 100 bird species to climate scenario data for the years 2051-2080 and three alternative emission scenarios in a 10-km grid system to predict changes in the species probability of occurrence. We related the projected changes in the climatic suitability to the amount of protected preferred habitat for the study species in the 10-km grid cells, and based on the cover of four main CORINE Land Cover classes in each conservation area in Finland. The probability of occurrence of all species (except marshland birds) decreased according to all scenarios, the decline being greatest in southern and smallest in northern boreal zones. This decline was slightly greater in unprotected than in protected areas for species of forests, mires and mountain habitats. The climatically suitable areas for the species were predicted to shift northwards, but the potential gain of southern species of conservation concern appears not to compensate for the loss of northern species. Thus, a representative protected area network is needed in all boreal zones. Overall, our results show that species-specific habitat preferences and habitat availability should be taken into account when assessing the efficiency of a protected area network in a changing climate.

AB  - Barriers and bridges to implement policies about sustainable development and sustainability commonly depend on the past development of social-ecological systems. Production of metals required integration of use of ore, streams for energy, and wood for bioenergy and construction, as well as of multiple societal actors. Focusing on the Swedish Bergslagen region as a case study we (1) describe the phases of natural resource use triggered by metallurgy, (2) the location and spatial extent of 22 definitions of Bergslagen divided into four zones as a proxy of cumulative pressure on landscapes, and (3) analyze the consequences for natural capital and society. We found clear gradients in industrial activity, stream alteration, and amount of natural forest from the core to the periphery of Bergslagen. Additionally, the legacy of top-down governance is linked to today's poorly diversified business sector and thus municipal vulnerability. Comparing the Bergslagen case study with other similar regions in Russia and Germany, we discuss the usefulness of multiple case studies.

AB  - Optimal understanding of biodiversity threats must consider the effects of population size and habitat quality on population viability. I examined the effects and relative importance of these factors for the performance of two endangered hemiparasitic plants, Melampyrum cristatum and M. arvense in Finland. I surveyed 18 M. cristatum and 14 M. arvense populations. Both habitat quality and population size influenced the performance of M. cristatum. By contrast, the performance of M. arvense was determined by habitat quality, but not influenced by population size. Habitat quality was improved in managed M. cristatum populations, which translated into greater hemiparasite performance in these populations. Degradation of suitable habitats has likely decreased the performance of the two endangered hemiparasites, resulting in reduced population sizes. The results highlight the importance of considering simultaneously population size effects and habitat quality. Habitat management seems to be the key to sustain or increase the viability of the hemiparasite populations, but the timing and intensity of management should be considered.

AB  - This article focus is on the perceived impact that aquaculture industry has on coastal communities in Northern Norway. Here, aquaculture is key industry with natural, social and economic impacts. In natural resource management in general, identifying and monitoring the perceived social impacts can be a useful tool for local planning. In order to ensure the blue growth goals of the Norwegian government and avoid conflict and mistrust in the future, it is important to understand how both the general public and stakeholders perceive the aquaculture industry, how it affects them and its use of space in the coastal zone. Hence, we ask a) how do coastal communities perceive the aquaculture industry and b) is there a legitimacy gap between the blue growth strategies of the Norwegian Government and the public? In order to answer these questions, we lean on theories related to legitimacy and stakeholder's participation. Original data were collected from structured (N = 150) and semi-structured interviews (N = 10) in two coastal communities in Northern Norway (Alstahaug and Bronnoy). Our findings suggest that a legitimacy gap does exist between blue growth goals and fishers in the communities studied, while the general citizen holds a positive attitude towards aquaculture. Insights from this study are useful for local, regional and national decision makers with responsibility for natural resource policies and development efforts.

AB  - At the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the imperative of monitoring progress and holding policy-makers accountable. For this purpose, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 230 global indicators were established with the double function of being a report card and a management tool. In the light of a pilot study about the experiences of local planning officials in the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, in relation to the suggested indicators for SDG 11, 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable', and a comparison with findings in four other cities, the paper argues for a need to reprioritize indicator criteria to serve better governance for sustainable development in diverse urban contexts worldwide.

AB  - We used data from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses (1989-92) to test the prediction that the reproductive success of ground nesting bird species is lowered in forest landscapes fragmented by the occurrence of agricultural land, presumably as a consequence of increased densities of generalist predators. Our study was based on 201 wildlife triangles located in central Finland (total length 2412 km). As expected, the proportion of black grouse hens with a brood in August decreased relative to the increasing proportion of agricultural land in a landscape (100 km(2)). However, on a smaller spatial scale (10.8 km(2)), the probability of an observed hen being with a brood was higher in the vicinity of fields. This finding may be explained by differences in habitat selection between hens with a brood and those without a brood. We did not find any negative effect of landscape composition on brood size. We conclude that increased predation pressure in forest landscapes fragmented by agriculture affects nesting success, but not the survival of black grouse chicks after hatching. Our results also emphasize the importance of spatial scale in studies of landscape ecology.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, several sustainability-profiled districts have been developed in Sweden with high bitions for the energy systems, such as Hammarby Sjo center dot stad in Stockholm and Western Harbor in Malmo center dot. Research into energy systems in urban districts is interdisciplinary and therefore spread over different areas, which means that an overview of the current state of knowledge and lessons learned is lacking. This semi-systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of previous research on the planning, development, and evaluation of energy systems in sustainability-profiled districts in Sweden. The review of 70 journal and conference articles reveals seven research themes in the interdisciplinary nexus of energy systems and sustainability-profiled districts: Conceptualizations and critique of sustainability-profiled districts, (2) Evaluations of energy goals and quirements, (3) Technical and economic assessments of heating and electricity systems, (4) Integration innovative (energy) solutions in urban planning, (5) Stakeholder perspectives on energy systems, (6) Stakeholder collaboration on the building and the district level, (7) Governance and policy instruments for sustainable urban development and energy systems. We use a socio-technical ecology approach to critically discuss the existing research on energy systems planning, development, and evaluation to guide future research on energy systems development in urban districts. An increase in integrated approaches across all identified research themes relationships between scales, phases, and impacts are discussed as central observations that can guide future research. Future research is needed on new or better-adapted energy indicators, the inclusion, perspectives, roles of (new) stakeholders, and the consideration of ecology and nature in research on the planning, devel-opment, and evaluation of energy systems.

AB  - In Europe, and many places throughout the world, the return, and preservation of large carnivores is escalating tensions between stakeholder groups, as well as between local actors and authorities. In Sweden, despite policies aimed at reducing conflict surrounding wildlife management, tensions seem to have intensified. This research investigates the collaborative governance model within Swedish wildlife management and what dampens the capacity to reduce ongoing tensions. In-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders at different levels of wildlife management. Through an abductive approach combining empirical data from interviews and theories from the human-wildlife conflict and collaborative governance literature, we problematize the role of regional wildlife managers in this multilevel governance context, in exploration of ways to advance collaboration. Our model analyzes the challenges for wildlife managers to implement government policies based on broad international conventions while remaining accountable to local concerns. The results reveal that issues within the governance structure and relationships within management in terms of lack of legitimacy, trust, and participation, need to be addressed to create a socially viable collaborative governance regime capable of managing conflict.

AB  - An area of research that has recently gained more attention is to understand how species respond to environmental change such as the landscape structure and fragmentation. Movement is crucial to select habitats but the landscape structure influences the movement patterns of animals. Characterising the movement characteristics, utilisation distribution (UD) and habitat selection of a single species in different landscapes can provide important insights into species response to changes in the landscape. We investigate these three fields in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in southern Sweden, in order to understand how landscape structure influences their movement and feeding patterns. Movements are compared between two regions, one dominated by a fragmented agriculture-forest mosaic and the other by managed homogenous forest. Red deer in the agriculture-dominated landscape had larger UDs compared to those in the forest-dominated area, moved larger distances between feeding and resting and left cover later in the day but used a similar duration for their movements, suggesting faster travelling speeds between resting and feeding locations. The habitat selection patterns of red deer indicate a trade-off between forage and cover, selecting for habitats that provide shelter during the day and forage by night. However, the level of trade-off, mediated through movement and space use patterns, is influenced by the landscape structure. Our approach provides further understanding of the link between individual animal space use and changing landscapes and can be applied to many species able to carry tracking devices.

AB  - The national scale nutrient load modelling system VEMALA-ICECREAM was used to simulate agricultural total nitrogen (TN) loading and its trends for all Finnish watersheds for the period from 1990-2019. Across Finland, agricultural TN loading (ATNL) has decreased from 17.4 kg ha-1 a-1 to 14.4 kg ha-1 a-1 (moving 10-year averages) since the 1990s. The main driver of the decrease in simulated ATNL is a reduction in mineral fertilizer use, which has decreased the N surplus in the soils. The TN leached fraction, however, did not show a trend but did have high annual variability due to variations in runoff; this corresponds to an average of 14.4% of the TN applied. The ATNL was considerably higher in the Archipelago Sea catchment compared to other Finnish Baltic Sea sub-catchments, with the lowest ATNL found in the Vuoksi catchment in Eastern Finland. The highest decrease of ATNL was simulated for Vuoksi and Gulf of Finland catchments. In the Bothnian Sea, Bothnian Bay and Archipelago Sea catchments, the decreasing trend of ATNL was smaller but still significant, with the exception of the Quark catchment, where there was no significant change. The differences in decreasing trends between regions can be explained by the heterogeneity of catchment characteristics, hydrology and agricultural practices in different regions.

AB  - Institutional and paradigmatic changes in Finnish fisheries and environmental governance in the light of the protection of the Saimaa ringed seal, Phoca hispida saimensis Nordq., are discussed. The analysis is based on written statements by stakeholder institutions in response to a proposal by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to restrict fishing in the breeding areas of the ringed seal. The controversy about the conservation of the Saimaa ringed seal is a revealing example of transition of an environmental conflict into a larger scale criticism of ongoing transformations in society related to paradigmatic changes of fisheries governance institutions. In addition to changed emphasis in different basic world outlooks, the contexts of the paradigms have changed. The policy restricting fishing by the authorities to support seal conservation is located between the paradigms of conservation and rationalisation. The Government has aligned itself with modern conservation ideas, but at the same time aroused strong resistance from the local level of fisheries governance. The local and regional stakeholders emphasised private water ownership, local knowledge and already established local agreements for seal conservation.

AB  - The present research examines the joint effects of climate change and management on the dead wood dynamics of the main tree species of the Finnish boreal forests via a forest ecosystem simulator. Tree processes are analyzed in stands subject to multiple biotic and abiotic environmental factors. A special focus is on the implications for biodiversity conservation thereof. Our results predict that in boreal forests, climate change will speed up tree growth and accumulation ending up in a higher stock of dead wood available as habitat for forest-dwelling species, but the accumulation processes will be much smaller in the working landscape than in set-asides. Increased decomposition rates driven by climate change for silver birch and Norway spruce will likely reduce the time the dead wood stock is available for dead wood-associated species. While for silver birch, the decomposition rate will be further increased in set-aside in relation to stands under ordinary management, for Norway spruce, set-asides can counterbalance the enhanced decomposition rate due to climate change thereby permitting a longer persistence of different decay stages of dead wood.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) has a long tradition in Finland, and modern sustainability concepts link economic, ecological and social aspects. The ecological aspect refers to the maintenance of biodiversity and the long-term functionality of forests, while the economic aspects concern continuity of timber supply. Socially sustainable forest management takes multiple use into consideration. These three components of SFM are commonly regarded as competing, or even exclusive, suggesting that there are trade-offs between them. Relationships between components of SFM, however, differ across spatial and temporal scales. Interdisciplinary research is needed to explore the interaction between sustainability components. This study explored the interrelationships between ecological, social and economic sustainability at the regional scale. Regional differences of sustainability components were also studied. Two economic, two social and eight ecological variables were included in the analyses. The study covered 41 regional municipality complexes in central Finland. The results show trade-offs between some ecological components and economic ones. Grouse abundance and numbers of old-growth forest patches decreased when forestry activity increased. There was some support for the idea that socially active communities compete less intensively with ecological components of forests than communities where forestry has a central role.

AB  - The lack of mobility choices in many Swedish neighbourhoods and cities designed for automobiles hinders the possibilities to shift towards more sustainable travel alternatives. Urban designers and planners can help with redesigning these neighbourhoods and creating urban forms that encourage walking, cycling and increased use of public transportation if they are informed about the environmental performance and carbon implications of transportation systems in existing and newly planned neighbourhoods. This paper proposes a mobility choices model based on urban form and accessibility factors commonly used in urban planning and design practices. The mobility choices model produces heat maps and visually informs about the integration with walking, cycling, public transportation and private car, modal shares, carbon emissions and transportation energy use. This information can (potentially) trigger urban transformation or redesign to better integrate sustainable travel alternatives in these neighbourhoods and contribute to more sustainable cities. Many houses can have an excellent environmental performance as buildings but they can be located at a distance where it is impossible to walk, cycle or use public transportation. The benefits of energy efficient and carbon neutral home then disappears with extensive travel and commuting by automobile.

AB  - Freshwater habitats and organisms are among the most threatened on Earth, and freshwater ecosystems have been subject to large biodiversity losses. We developed a Climate Change Sensitivity (CCS) indicator based on trait information for a selection of stream-and lake-dwelling Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa. We calculated the CCS scores based on ten species traits identified as sensitive to global climate change. We then assessed climate change sensitivity between the six main ecoregions of Sweden as well as the three Swedish regions based on Illies. This was done using biological data from 1,382 stream and lake sites where we compared large-scale (ecoregional) patterns in climate change sensitivity with potential future exposure of these ecosystems to increased temperatures using ensemble-modelled future changes in air temperature. Current (1961 similar to 1990) measured temperature and ensemble-modelled future (2100) temperature showed an increase from the northernmost towards the southern ecoregions, whereas the predicted temperature change increased from south to north. The CCS indicator scores were highest in the two northernmost boreal ecoregions where we also can expect the largest global climate change-induced increase in temperature, indicating an unfortunate congruence of exposure and sensitivity to climate change. These results are of vital importance when planning and implementing management and conservation strategies in freshwater ecosystems, e.g., to mitigate increased temperatures using riparian buffer strips. We conclude that traits information on taxa specialization, e.g., in terms of feeding specialism or taxa having a preference for high altitudes as well as sensitivity to changes in temperature are important when assessing the risk from future global climate change to freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Fire regimes across the world are expected to be altered by continuing variations in socio-economic conditions and climate. Current global fire-vegetation models are able to represent the present-day fire activity, but it is unclear how well they can simulate past or future scenarios. Here we use sedimentary charcoal-based biomass burning reconstructions to evaluate fire probability and total carbon flux emitted to the atmosphere per year simulated by the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with its incorporated fire model SIMFIRE-BLAZE across the boreal region during the last century. The analyses were run for the whole time period (1900-2000 CE), as well as for the intervals 1900-1950 CE and 1950-2000 CE. The data-model comparison for the 20(th) century reveals a general disagreement in trends between charcoal reconstructions (with decreasing or stable trends) and simulations (showing an overall increase) at both global (boreal forests) and continental scales (North America and Fennoscandia), as well as for most of the regional sub-areas (Canada, Norway and Sweden). The only exceptions are Alaska and Finland/Russia Karelia, where all the variables increase. Negative correlations between observations and model outputs are also recorded for the two different sub-periods, except for Alaska and North America during the time interval 1900-1950 CE, and Norway and Finland/Russia Karelia between 1950 and 2000 CE. Despite several uncertainties in charcoal records, main differences between modeled and observed fire activity are probably due to limitations in the representation of the human impact on fire regime (especially connected to forest management and landscape fragmentation) in the model simulations.

AB  - Purpose A nature reserve set up in a disaster-stricken area can have various functions, e.g. as a place where biodiversity is favored and sometimes as a memory of a traumatic event. This study presents four different record-breaking disasters during 1992-2014 in Sweden, where the idea of setting up reserves has been advanced in the aftermath, but with slightly different results in relation to attitudes about nature conservation and modes of remembering. The phenomenon is primarily discussed against theory formation around disaster memorials and window of opportunity for change. Design/methodology/approach comparative case study approach. The cases are described through narratives on the basis of "grey" literature, i.e. documents from Swedish authorities in the form of evaluations, summaries from experience seminars, political decisions on the establishment of nature conservation or information material addressed to the public, and also media reporting. Findings The nature reserves will be reminiscent of the disasters since the natural regrowth will take decades but may also be accompanied by exhibitions in visitor centers, arts and plays, monuments and bureaucratic documents, all of which contribute to the memory. In all but one case, such artifacts are secondary in relation to the explicit goal of forest conservation. The local population's attitude to the reserve formation plays a big role for the plans to be implemented. Originality/value Foundation of nature reserves in the immediate aftermath of a disaster may have different functions for actors, affected people and interested public; some are exemplified and discussed here.

AB  - In this paper, we study the integration of ecological sustainability and social welfare concerns in cities. Efforts to handle ecological challenges risk having negative impacts on equality and social welfare. While current levels of consumption and material welfare are unsustainable, there is a need for more sustainable approaches to welfare and wellbeing. Still, ecological and social concerns in urban governance are treated as separated topics. Based on text analysis of policy documents and qualitative interviews, we study how ecological and social welfare concerns are being addressed and integrated into urban planning in three Swedish cities (Stockholm, Goteborg, Malmo). Theoretically, the paper draws on conceptualizations of sustainable welfare, social and ecological sustainability, and policy integration. We find ecological and social welfare concerns being acknowledged as interconnected and we see signs of an emerging sustainable welfare agenda in the cities, e.g., around Agenda 2030. However, in practice, eco-social policy integration is only established to a limited degree, for instance in neighborhood development, transport planning, and green city planning. Issues of ecological justice and equity and the relationship between socioeconomic factors and consumption-related environmental impacts are hardly addressed. Thus, much remains to be done for eco-social policy integration to materialize at the urban level.

AB  - It is known that biotope characteristics and species distribution patterns reflect human influences on the landscape to an increasing extent. In this study, we demonstrate a landscape change trajectory analysis, where the land cover and land use changes are identified from 1690 to 1998. Knowledge of the landscape change dynamics is compared to the present-day detected oak woodlands, which are characterised and re-classified according to the identified land cover and land use trajectories. Additionally, the study aims to advance combined analysis of spatial landscape data within GIS by developing methods for completing a landscape trajectory analysis. A total of six different land use trajectory types within the present-day oak woodlands were identified. The land use trajectories we found reflected both large shifts in land use during the study period but also local differences in land-use activities on the island of Ruissalo, SW Finland. These can be used to better explain and characterise oak woodlands, their development, present state and biodiversity.

AB  - Compared to conventional energy technologies, hydropower has the lowest carbon emissions per kWh. Therefore, hydropower electricity production can contribute to combat climate change challenges. However, hydropower electricity production may at the same time contribute to environmental impacts and has been characterized as a large water consumer with impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Life Cycle Assessment is not yet able to assess the biodiversity impact of water consumption from hydropower electricity production on a global scale. The first step to assess these biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment is to quantify the water consumption per kWh energy produced. We calculated catchment-specific net water consumption values for Norway ranging between 0 and 0.012 m(3)/kWh. Further, we developed the first characterization factors for quantifying the aquatic biodiversity impacts of water consumption in a post-glaciated region. We apply our approach to quantify the biodiversity impact per kWh Norwegian hydropower electricity. Our results vary over six orders of magnitude and highlight the importance of a spatial explicit approach. This study contributes to assessing the biodiversity impacts of water consumption globally in Life Cycle Assessment.

AB  - A land use policy shift is taking place in a growing number of cities regarding parking, whereby a conventional supply management approach is being replaced with a parking management approach. As part of this policy shift, many cities are lowering their parking requirements. This study analysed changes in car use, car ownership, spatial parking patterns and the consequences for the everyday life of residents in a housing area with a relatively restrictive parking requirement in Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. The housing area, a concrete example of how lowering parking requirements can be used to achieve targets on reduced car use and sustainable urban development, is used to discuss how parking policy should be applied to achieve the desired effect. The results show that the consequences of the restrictive requirement was paradoxically small in the study area. In practice, the requirement did not result in a decrease in the number of parking spaces, because e.g. of access to parking in neighbouring residential areas. This shows how important it is to adopt a holistic approach in parking policy, by e.g. introducing more restrictive parking requirements in parallel with other measures, such as raising parking charges and decreasing the number of public parking spaces. It also shows that planning of parking must be coordinated with other urban planning functions. Otherwise, the actual contribution of a shift in parking policy to the development of a more environmentally friendly transport system and city risks being small, despite lower parking requirements.

AB  - National forest inventories (NFIs) have traditionally been designed to assess the production value of forests as well as forest biodiversity. However, in this study, the aim is to show a new application of NFIs, namely the estimation of the landscape metric contagion. This metric is commonly calculated on rasterbased land cover/use maps. In this study, a sample-based dataset from the Swedish NFI was used. The estimated contagion metric is based on a distance-dependent function so that the value of the metric is small for longer distances, whereas the corresponding estimated variance is large for longer distances. With this procedure, comparisons can be made for different landscapes at a given time and or to compare any given landscape over time. The main advantages are that the approach can be applied where raster-based land cover/use maps of the landscape are not available and that the data obtained from NFIs (e.g., land cover type) typically are of high quality in comparison with remotely sensed data due to being based on direct observation in the field survey. The procedure applied here accommodates both the patch-mosaic and the gradient-based model approach to landscape structure.

AB  - The following study is the first Swedish study on Halal tourism in Sweden. The purpose of this exploratory research is to get insight into the perception of Halal tourism in Sweden among representatives of tourism stakeholders. The overall methodology approach in this research is qualitative, consisting of 25 qualitative questionnaires, 21 short letters, four follow-up interviews, and a web observation, and content analysis was employed. The results indicate that there is a low knowledge of Halal tourism in Sweden including Swedish tourism industry. The concept is very challenging, and profits are low. It might result in problem scenarios such as detrimental effects on non-Halal tourism, cultural difficulties and increased risk of xenophobia, anti-Islamism, and tension in the society. There is low interest for Sweden among Muslim tourists as the interest and priority for Halal tourism is rather low from Swedish tourism industry. Despite Halal tourism's importance internationally, these representatives are rather cautious and doubtful about promotion of Sweden towards this niche. Still, a majority seems to be positive to a lighter version of Muslim-friendly tourism with secular/moderate Muslims as a target group.

AB  - As wild ungulate densities increase across Europe and North America, plant-herbivore interactions are increasingly important from ecological and economic perspectives. These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant-herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species. However, wolf territory presence had negative effects on browsing occurrence and pressure when interacting with secondary roads, young forest, or snow cover. We showed that roads can influence browsing patterns in Norway and Sweden. However, further research is needed, particularly in the face of continued infrastructure development in Scandinavia.

AB  - We studied the occurrence and cover of epiphytic bryophytes and one lichen species (Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm.) growing on Populus tremula L. trunks. Our aim was to explore the spatial scales where epiphyte species respond to their environment. At the landscape scale, fragmented Finnish old-growth forests close to the Russian border and farther west in a heavily fragmented landscape were compared with Russian sites with more continuous old-growth forest landscapes to assess the effect of landscape structure on epiphyte assemblages. We studied factors affecting populations at the level of individual sites and local habitat patches within the forests. Twelve sites were surveyed for epiphytes. We estimated epiphyte occurrence from 353 Populus tremula trunks. There seemed to be only minor differences in the structure of epiphyte assemblages between the three landscapes surveyed. Species richness varied also independently of the landscape structure but was positively related to regional Populus tremula abundance (alpha diversity) and the size of the substrate trunk (point diversity). At the regional scale, the most important factor affecting the occurrence of epiphytes was the abundance of Populus tremula. At the local scale, the size of the Populus tremula surveyed and tree density around the trunk surveyed correlated positively with the occurrence of some species. The size and abundance of Populus tremula as well as tree density are the most important factors for maintaining viable populations of the studied species.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important legislative and scientific tool that may assist and improve the quality assistance for the decision-making process in sustainable development. Here, a comparison of EIAs from three cases of hydropower projects in Pakistan, Norway and Sweden is reported. A huge difference concerning the incorporation of environmental considerations into the decisionmaking process between developed and developing countries is observed. The EIA system of Pakistan appears to be less efficient in the application and review process. In addition, the appraisal of issues, the decision-making process and evaluation through post-monitoring is not as well performed in Pakistan as in cases of hydroelectric power plants in Sweden and Norway. The key reason for this shortcoming is misconceptions about the EIA process, which initially receives intense attention but becomes weakened by the time of implementation. This implies that there is a need to adopt simplified and flexible EIA techniques suitable for the infrastructure and resources of a specific country, taking into account institutional, technical and financial constraints. Improvements are required in public participation, awareness, as well as in environmental control and data system sectors in Pakistan, besides simply enacting legislation to achieve the goals of the EIA system.

AB  - Following the "green" growth tradition, the construction of lower carbon energy (renewable energy) infrastructures, such as wind power, has gained prominence in Norway. This has led to indigenous Saami herders confronting pastureland dispossession, some citizens fearing the industrialization of nature, and municipal councils losing formal governance power in favor of national agencies and private-sector project developers-justified by the urgency of the climate crisis. The purpose of the paper is to explore how energy infrastructures aimed at decarbonization have led to social fragmentation and ecological degradation alongside claims of economic revitalization potential in & ANGS;fjord. The authors draw upon fieldwork conducted within Saepmie (or Sapmi), the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Sami, and investigate the Fosen Vind energy project in the & ANGS;fjord Municipality. They find that lower carbon energy infrastructures, such as "wind farms," have been normalized as unavoidable, and damage to habitat and encroachment on Saami livelihoods are positioned as necessary sacrifices for the greater good of fighting the climate crisis. The authors conclude that avoiding the creation of green sacrifice zones in making low-carbon places requires a more transformative vision than the visions offered by techno-solutionism, such as degrowth.

AB  - A major challenge in conservation biology is to understand species' responses to habitat loss. In Fennoscandia, the ongoing decline in aspen in forests is of particular concern, since aspen is the boreal forest tree species that supports the most host-specific species of cryptogams and invertebrates. In order to predict the potential effects of aspen decline we compared the occurrence of three epiphytic cyanolichens in old-growth stands of the same habitat quality, in four aspen-rich and four aspen-poor landscapes. Collema curtisporum and Collema furfuraceum were, on average, five and six times more frequent, respectively, in the aspen-rich than in the aspen-poor landscapes. Leptogium saturninum was not affected by the abundance of aspen stands at the landscape level. Our data suggests that lichen species with poor dispersal abilities may be more sensitive to habitat loss than more easily dispersed species and that species with broader habitat amplitude may be less sensitive to habitat loss than more specialized species, even if they have inferior dispersal ability. We conclude that (i) predictions of species occurrences at the stand level have to take account of the amount of suitable habitat at the landscape level, and (ii) predicting the responses of individual species based on life-history traits can be crucial, but cannot be based on single traits. Thus our study shows that biological value cannot be assessed on the basis of habitat quality alone and that a landscape perspective is needed for the sustainable management of specialist species.

In 1912, a strict nature protection reserve, with non-intervention management, was established on Moricsala Island in Latvia, located in the boreo-nemoral forest zone. Prior to establishment of the nature reserve, part of the island area was used for agriculture. The island is now covered almost entirely by forest dominated by Quercus robur L. and Tilia cordata Mill. on sandy soils. Resurvey was conducted in 2011 in 17 plots in which tree layers and the understory vegetation had been described in 1930. The plots were classified into two groups based on tree species composition in 1930 to determine changes in species composition. Differences in understory and tree canopy composition between these groups persisted over the period between the studies, in relation to soil factors and past stand history. Considerable turnover of species occurred, with a decrease of species typical of open habitats and replacement by species typical of nemoral (temperate deciduous) forest plant communities. In the past, Q. robur had likely established in open habitats created by agricultural land use or past fire but is presently not regenerating in the understory.

AB  - Soil loss by erosion threatens food security and reduces the environmental quality of water bodies. Prolonged and extreme rainfalls are recognized as main drivers of soil erosion, and climate change predictions for large parts of the world foresee such increases in precipitation. Erosion rates are additionally affected by land use, which may change as a result of the shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to an economy relying on using renewable biomass, a "Bioeconomy". In this study we aimed at investigating, through modelling, i) if future changes in land use, due to a bioeconomy, would increase the risk for soil loss and enhance suspended sediment yields in streams and ii) if these changes, when combined with climate change effects, would further aggravate suspended sedi-ment conditions in a catchment. We used hydrological and bias adjusted climate models to compare the effect of seven land use pathways on discharge and sediment transport relative to a baseline scenario under present and future climate conditions. The study was carried out based on data from a small headwater stream, represen-tative for cereal production areas of S-E Norway. By modelling our scenarios with the PERSiST and INCA-P models, we found that land use change had a greater influence on both future water discharge and sediment losses than a future climate. Changes from climate showed strongest differences on a seasonal basis. Out of the modelled land use pathways, a sustainable pathway manifested the least occurrence of extreme flood and sediment loss events under future climate; whereas a pathway geared towards self-sufficiency indicated the highest occurrence of such extreme events. Our findings show that careful attention must be placed on the land use and soil management in the region. To maintain freshwater quality, it will be increasingly important to implement environmental mitigation measures.

AB  - Global conservation expansion has been associated with significant changes in cross-scale interactions and in the discourses surrounding them engendering new scale challenges in the field of biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we analyze frames of scale challenges by drawing on evidence from eight focus groups of stakeholders and scientists from Greece and Finland. By following a systematic frame analysis we found three dominant frames. First, framing scale challenges as mainly derived from knowledge gaps regarding ecological scale emphasizes the scale problems occurring when only limited consideration is given to the scale-dependence of ecological phenomena. This prioritizes the formulation of scientifically informed conservation policies, discounting the importance of governance by concentrating on specialized environmental administrations. Second, framing scale challenges as stemming from limited fit highlights the scale problems caused by discrepancies in the alignment of natural and social scales and underlines the need to optimize the match between ecological and governance levels with more or less fixed boundaries. Third, framing scale challenges as primarily derived from inequalities in existing power relationships and learning processes emphasizes scale problems resulting when the dominant perception of scale is seen as a neutral, technical issue. This calls for investigations focused explicitly on how conservation scaling contributes to the production of new social-ecological entities in space and time. Dialogues between aspects of the different frames offer a potential path toward deliberative learning aimed at resolving current contradictions in the spatial patterning of human-environment interactions produced by biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Capsule The amount of forest (at local and landscape scales) and occurrence of residual habitats at the local scale are shown to be the major factors influencing bird community composition in farmland-forest landscapes in central Sweden.
   Aims To investigate the importance of local habitat and landscape structure for breeding birds in farmland-forest landscapes in central Sweden.
   Methods Breeding birds were censused at 292 points. A detailed habitat mapping was made within 300 m of the points. Within a 300-600 m radius only two major habitats (forests and arable fields) were identified.
   Results Cluster analyses of bird communities identified three site types that also differed in habitat composition: (i) partially forested sites in forested landscapes; (ii) heterogeneous sites with residual habitats in mosaic landscapes; and (iii) field-dominated farmland sites in open landscapes. A total of 19 of 25 farmland bird species (restricted to farmland or using both farmland and forest) had the highest abundance in farmland sites with mosaics of forest and farmland, while only six farmland species had the highest abundance in field-dominated sites. The bird community changed from being dominated by farmland species to being dominated by forest species (common in forest landscapes without farmland) at small proportions (10-20%) of forest at the local scale. A major difference in habitat composition between heterogeneous and field-dominated sites was the occurrence of different residual habitats (e.g. shrubby areas and seminatural grasslands). These habitats seemed to influence bird community composition more than land-use, despite covering <10% of the area. Seminatural grasslands were important for bird community composition and species-richness, but grazing seemed to be less important. Among different land-use types, cereal crops were the least preferred fields. Set-asides with tall vegetation and short rotation coppices were positively associated with species-richness of farmland birds.
   Conclusion In general, the composition of the landscape was important for bird community composition, although amount and distribution of forests, occurrence of residual habitats and land-use of fields at the local scale had the strongest influence on bird community composition. The possible implications of these patterns for managing farmland-forest landscapes are discussed.

AB  - Target orientation in road management allows consideration of non-monetary landscape values that have been largely ignored due to lack of assessment tools and insufficient knowledge. We discuss shortcomings in traditional road planning and describe the new Swedish target-oriented approach to integrate natural and socio-cultural assets in road management. The approach is based on tangible environmental targets and criteria that can be enforced.
   We emphasize the advantages of the new approach and conclude that target orientation helps to integrate environmental impact assessment into the planning and performance control system. It enhances landscape-ecological concern among planners and strengthens the dialogue between engineers and environmentalists. Target orientation requires an elaborate monitoring system that has roots in a profound ecological understanding. in order to monitor performance and to validate measures mitigating negative effects of landscape fragmentation, further methodological development and applied ecological research are necessary.

AB  - Hanski, I.K. 1998: Home ranges and habitat use in the declining flying squirrel Pteromys volans in managed forests. - Wildl. Biol. 4: 33-46.
   The flying squirrel Pteromys volans is an arboreal rodent and inhabitant of Palearctic boreal forests. In Finland, the flying squirrel has been classified as a declining species which needs to be monitored. I studied home ranges, habitat use and nocturnal activity of eight adult flying squirrels by radio tracking in fragmented coniferous forests in Finland during June - December, 1996. Average home-range size of the flying squirrel measured by the 100% MCP was 6.5 ha. In summer, the average size of the 95% cluster area was 2.3 ha and the 80% core area 0.5 ha. The core areas represented only 7.8% of the 100% MCP area and were composed of 2-6 separate patches in the home ranges of individual squirrels. Radio-tagged squirrels used several nests, both old woodpecker cavities and dreys for nesting and diurnal roosting. The combined density of all deciduous tree species was significantly greater in the 80% core areas than within the 100% MPC in the summer data set. In the polychotomous logistic regression model the great canopy cover, high densities of alders Alnus incana and A. glutinosa and aspen Populus tremula significantly explained the ranked utilisation classes (utilisation rank from highly used areas to least used areas: 80% core - 95% cluster - 100% MCP). The three most abundant deciduous trees species (birches Betula pendula and B. pubescens, aspen, alder) constituted 87% of trees used by squirrels in summer. Flying squirrels were found in aspens more often than expected according to their availability. The results show a clear preference for deciduous trees and a preference for the parts of home ranges with higher densities of alders and aspen. The flying squirrel seems to be capable of using several cover types, including young forest stands, as foraging and moving areas and are able to move across semi-open clear-cut areas.

AB  - The replacement of some spruce monocultures with stands composed of planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and naturally regenerated birch (Betula spp.) has a range of potential benefits, but the implications for biodiversity are generally unknown. Here we conduct a paired replicated study in southern Sweden of the avian biodiversity found within Norway spruce monocultures, and within Norway spruce stands possessing approximately 20% birch. Our research leads us to three findings. First, avian diversity was significantly higher in the spruce birch polycultures. Second, spruce birch polycultures exclusively attracted broadleaf-associated bird species and retained the majority of conifer-associated bird species found in the spruce monocultures. Third, avian biodiversity within the spruce birch polycultures did not incorporate threatened taxa. We suggest that in addition to the apparent benefits for stand level diversity, widespread use of spruce birch polycultures could provide a means of softening the matrix for broadleaved-associated species, while concurrently providing an increased broadleaf base from which future conservation actions could be implemented. Our results are relevant to multi-use forestry, and recent policy initiatives by forest certification agencies which aim to increase broadleaf-associated biodiversity within conifer-dominated production forest landscapes.

AB  - Globalisation and urbanisation are driving the worldwide homogenisation of urban landscapes. The flora and fauna of cities in different parts of the world are very similar, irrespective of geography and climate. One of the most powerful symbols of modern urban landscapes is the lawn. There are just a few management options for urban lawns, regardless of how they are used and where in the city they are situated. Today, lawns occupy much of the green open spaces in cities (70-75%) and are located in private front and rear gardens, public parks, cemeteries, golf courses and along roads. Most people in the Western world view lawns as a 'natural' and even compulsory element of the urban landscape, without questioning their social, symbolic, ecological or aesthetic values. In this article we discuss the conceptual framework and methodological approaches being used in an ongoing transdisciplinary collaboration project including stakeholders to study lawns in Sweden as a social and ecological phenomenon. The overall aim is to understand the role of lawns in sustainable urban planning, design and management. The transdisciplinary approach allows us to exchange knowledge between scientific disciplines in order to influence the studies within each subject throughout the project and to achieve a multi-dimensional understanding of the lawn as a phenomenon. The involvement and close collaboration of stakeholders in the project allows us to obtain first-hand information on planning issues connected to lawns and existing planning data from cities and to focus on true implementation aspects rather than just theoretical recommendations.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change in forestry has become a growing concern, in part due to the impact of storms and other events that have raised the awareness of such risks amongst forest owners. Sweden is one of Europe's most densely-forested countries, with this sector playing a major role economically. However adaptation has, to a large extent, been limited to the provision of recommendations to forest managers, most of which have only been partially implemented. This paper summarizes research with direct implications for adaptation to climate change within the forestry sector in Sweden. The focus is based in particular on providing examples of adaptations that illustrate the specific Swedish orientation to adaptation, in line with its relatively intensive forest management system. The paper thus illustrates a specific Swedish orientation to adaptation through active management, which can be contrasted with approaches to adaptation in other forestry systems, in particular those with limited management or management based on maintaining natural forests in particular.

AB  - This article provides a case study of a project in Kondoa, Tanzania under the programme Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). It demonstrates how a success narrative came to dominate presentations about the project as a multi-win involving not only climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation, but also benefits for local people and poverty reduction. Based on repeated fieldwork using qualitative methods, we find that there is lack of evidence to substantiate the success claims. These claims are in particular based on the assertion that a component of conservation agriculture' was successfully implemented as compensation for forest enclosure. Gaps between claims and evidence are often exhibited in the scholarship on political ecologies of conservation in Africa, as well as by observers of development aid projects. But how can such gaps be explained? We suggest taking the interests of the actors behind the project as a point of departure, including how individuals as well as organisations have stakes in marketing a success narrative. Furthermore, we argue that an unsubstantiated success narrative of an aid project can be maintained only when there is a lack of structures to ensure independent and adequate examinations of the project by evaluators and researchers. In this case, Norway was the funder of the project, and as the dominant funder of REDD, the Norwegian government has a particular interest in reproducing REDD success narratives, since the credibility of the country's climate mitigation policy depends on REDD being a success. In addition, the case study demonstrates how success projects' emerge in the wake of new development fads.

AB  - In Finland, 61% of classified river kilometres were below good water quality in 1994-1997. Diffuse loading originating from land use in river basins has the most important role in the deterioration of water quality. Therefore, practical tools for planning sustainable land use in river basins are important. In the RiverLife project (1998-2001) a decision support system, RiverLifeDSS, was developed to be used through the Internet (http://www.environment.fi/riverlife). The system contains information packages, tools and methods for planning water pollution control and management of river basins. The use of RiverLifeDSS was demonstrated during the project in three Finnish target river basins for which also management plans were drawn. The RiverLifeDSS is useful in the implementation of the WFD in river basins as it gives information on river environment, ecology and biology and the factors affecting them, and on methods in river water pollution control. The system helps to make integrated river basin management plans, in which the whole river basins are taken into account. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) is distributed in coastal and inland habitats all over Europe, but spawns in the Sargasso Sea and is thus affected by both continental and oceanic factors. Since the 1980s a steady decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels to freshwater and in total eel landings. The eel is considered as critically endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of species. The Skagerrak beach seine survey from Norway constitutes the longest fishery-independent dataset on yellow/silver eels (starting in 1904). The Skagerrak coastal region receives larvae born in the Sargasso Sea spawning areas that have followed the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift before they penetrate far into the North Sea. The Skagerrak coastal time series is therefore particularly valuable for exploring the impacts of oceanic factors on fluctuations in eel recruitment abundance. Analyses showed that Sargasso Sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 12 years revealing a cyclic and detrimental effect of high temperatures on the newly hatched larvae. The North Atlantic Oscillation index and inflow of North Atlantic water into the North Sea were negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 11 years. Increased currents towards the North Atlantic during high North Atlantic Oscillation years may send larvae into the subpolar gyre before they are ready to metamorphose and settle, resulting in low recruitment in the northern part of the distribution area for these years. The Skagerrak time series was compared with glass eel recruitment to freshwater in the Netherlands (Den Oever glass eel time series), and similar patterns were found revealing a cycle linked to changes in oceanic factors affecting glass eel recruitment. The recent decline of eels in the Skagerrak also coincided with previously documented shifts in environmental conditions of the North Sea ecosystem.

AB  - We analyze three environmentally conscious works that are concerned with the state of Finnish forests: the documentary film Metsan tarina/Tale of a Forest (2012), the book with the same name (2013) and the series of short documentaries Tarinoita metsasta/Tales from the Forest (2013). By combining methods from arts research and ecology, we ask how the narratives adapt material from nature photography. The film and book present mythic stories and old Finnish beliefs about forests. They also contain references to cultural memory. Additionally, the biodiversity on display reflects a conventional practice to exhibit large or charismatic species. However, the ecological message remains only implicit, expressed through aesthetic choices rather than information about natural processes. Overall, we suggest that adaptation in these narratives can be understood as an artistic process of recycling and referencing and as a way to reconnect with cultural memory and nature. As such, it can enhance relationships with nature and awareness of conservation needs. However, we ask whether the past-oriented strategy is a politically effective way to activate a connection with nature in modern Finland, where discussions about environmental problems are closely connected to heated debates about forestry.

AB  - Contemporary studies demonstrate that rodent bites do not occur frequently. However, a huge number of cases were reported from Peshawar vale, Pakistan during 2016. Two species, the local black rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the invasive brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769) might be the suspected cause. Several studies indicated the invasion of brown rats into Pakistan presumably via port city of Karachi. In this study, we modeled geospatial distribution of rodent bites for risk assessment in the region. Bite cases reported to tertiary care lady reading hospital were monitored from January 1 to August 31, 2016. Among 1747 cases, statistically informative data (n = 1295) was used for analyses. MaxEnt algorithm was employed for geospatial modeling, taking into account various environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and elevation) and anthropogenic factors (human population density, distance from roads, distance from water channels, and land use/land cover). MaxEnt results revealed that urban slums (84.5%) are at highest risk followed by croplands (10.9%) and shrublands (2.7%). Anthropogenic factors affecting incidence of rodent bites included host density (contribution: 34.7), distance from water channels (3.2), land use/land cover (2.8), and distance from roads (2). Most of the cases occurred within a radius of 0.3 km from roads and 5 km from water channels. Rodent bite incidence is currently at its peak in Peshawar vale. Factors significantly affecting rodents' bite activity and their distribution and dispersal include urbanization, distance from roads, and water channels. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of invasion by brown rat on bite incidence.

AB  - Understanding how cities develop climate plans is crucial to capture their potential to achieve ambitious climate goals. Previous literature has highlighted the role of external pressures or heroic actors in driving local changes. By highlighting the everyday practices of actors in urban climate planning, we reveal new sets of contradictions in climate governance. Drawing from social practice theory, this paper examines how contradictions were managed in the process of developing a new climate plan in Bergen, Norway. Through a variety of empirical sources, we explore the strategic value these offer, and the organisational work accomplished by the navigation of contradictions. We highlight three strategic benefits of negotiating contradictions: the legitimisation, expansion and signalling of climate work. In conclusion, the paper argues that considering practices of climate planning reveals novel forms of agency, namely the potential of mundane organisational processes and the pivotal role of civil servants in this work.

AB  - Large carnivores are expanding in Europe, and their return is associated with conflicts that often result in policies to regulate their population size through culling. Being wide-ranging species, their populations are often distributed across several jurisdictions, which may vary in the extent to which they use lethal control. This creates the conditions for the establishment of source-sink dynamics across borders, which may frustrate the ability of countries to reach their respective management objectives. To explore the consequences of this issue, we constructed a vec-permutation projection model, applied to the case of wolverines in south-central Scandinavia, shared between Norway (where they are culled) and Sweden (where they are protected). We evaluated the effect of compensatory immigration on wolverine population growth rates, and if the effect was influenced by the distance to the national border. We assessed to what extent compensatory immigration had an influence on the number of removals needed to keep the population at a given growth rate. In Norway, the model estimated a stable trend, whereas in Sweden it produced a 10% annual increase. The effect of compensatory immigration corresponded to a 0.02 reduction in population growth rate in Sweden and to a similar increase in Norway. This effect was strong closer to the Norwegian-Swedish border, but weak when moving away from it. An average of 33 wolverines was shot per year in the Norwegian part of the study area. If no compensatory immigration from Sweden had occurred, 28 wolverines shot per year would have been sufficient to achieve the same goal. About 15.5% of all the individuals harvested in Norway between 2005 and 2012 were compensated by immigrants, causing a decrease in population growth rate in Sweden. Synthesis and applications. When a population is transboundary, the consequences of management decisions are also transboundary, even though the political bodies in charge of those decisions, the stakeholders who influence them, and the taxpayers who finance them are not. It is important that managers and citizens be informed that a difference in management goals can reduce the efficiency, and increase the costs, of wildlife management.

AB  - In this study participatory approaches were used to develop alternative forest resource management scenarios with particular respect to the effects on increased use of forest bioenergy and its effect on biodiversity in Eastern Finland. As technical planning tools, we utilized a forest management planning system (MELA) and the Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment (ToSIA) to visualize the impacts of the scenarios. We organized a stakeholder workshop where group discussions were used as a participatory method to get the stakeholder preferences and insights concerning forest resource use in the year 2030. Feedback from the workshop was then complemented with a questionnaire. Based on the results of the workshop and a questionnaire we developed three alternative forest resource scenarios: (1) bioenergy 2030 in which energy production is more centralized and efficient; (2) biodiversity 2030 - in which harvesting methods are more nature friendly and protected forests make up 10% of the total forest area; and (3) mixed bioenergy + biodiversity 2030 scenario - in which wood production, recreation and nature protection are assigned to the most suitable areas. The study showed that stakeholder engagement combined with the MELA and ToSIA tools can be a useful approach in scenario development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper brings new insight on practices that enable planning processes concerning urban green landscapes (everyday landscapes) to move beyond the somewhat deadlocked conflict between conservation and development. The empirical basis is four planning processes in Norway and Sweden illuminating the following research questions: How is the tension between densification and conservation in everyday landscapes handled in concrete planning processes? Is it possible to identify practices that create opportunity for viable compromises between development and conservation interests? The analysis identifies the core position of expert knowledge in creating a basis for compromise in political processes. Furthermore, green structure as a coherent and basic entity in planning is emerging as a decisive force in local discourse held by the civil society, public authorities, and developers alike. I argue that these elements contribute to create viable compromises on the future development of everyday landscapes, thus functioning as building bricks in creating more agonistic planning practices.

AB  - Although the productive fishing grounds had long attracted the Crown and the Church to northern Sweden, it was not until the sixteenth century that the judicial and fiscal powers of the Swedish Crown were exercised in full. Records show that the regular fishing in interior lakes formed a prominent enterprise among coastal farmer communities. This paper examines the social and economic context of farmers engaged in interior fishing with respect to the internal organization of village communities, principles of private and collective ownership, land-use strategies and inter-community relations. There are no a-priori assumptions about the coastal population being Swedish. Instead of applying ethnonyms, the terms farmer and coastal are used throughout the paper. The main area of investigation includes the coastal area of northernmost Sweden and the western parts of Finnish Lapland. The study shows that interior lakes fitted into village resource areas, long sanctioned by usage, and that usufruct belonged to village members collectively. A large part of the fishing lakes are situated in interior Sami territory. Fishermen were internalizing Sami place names, implying close relations between the groups. Archeological investigations point to subsistence strategies including systemic interior lake fishing being established before AD 1200. The authors propose that coastal and interior communities should be perceived as two economic strategies representing indigenous and pre-colonial land-use schemes.

AB  - Putting climate change policy-integration into practice is challenged by problems of institutional misfit, due to, inter alia, deficient vertical administrative interplay. While most focus within the field of climate change research has targeted the national-local interplay, less is known about the interface of regional and local perspectives. Here, the aim is to study that interface with a specific focus on the relation between regional and local spatial planning actors, through a case-study of transport and coastal zone management in a Swedish municipality. The article is based on interviews (focus group and single in-depth) and official planning documents. The material reveals a tricky planning situation, replete with conflict. In practice, various institutional frameworks, claims and ambitions collide. The attempts to steer the local spatial planning initiatives from the regional level led to conflicts, which in turn seems to have hampered the overall work for climate change management through spatial planning. Furthermore, there are few traces of prospects of a smooth vertical institutional interplay able to support the overall aims related to integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation in spatial planning.

AB  - With the current loss of biodiversity and threats to freshwater ecosystems, it is crucial to identify hot-spots of biodiversity and on which spatial scale they can be resolved. Conservation and management of these important ecosystems needs insight into whether most of the regional biodiversity (i.e. gamma-diversity) can be found locally (i.e. high alpha-diversity) or whether it is distributed across the region (i.e. high beta-diversity). Biodiversity patterns of benthic macroinvertebrates and diatoms were studied in 30 headwater streams in five Swedish catchments by comparing the relative contribution of alpha- and beta-diversity to gamma-diversity between two levels of stream habitat hierarchy (catchment and region level). The relationship between species community structure and local environmental factors was also assessed. Our results show that both alpha- and beta-diversity made a significant contribution to gamma-diversity. beta-diversity remained relatively constant between the two levels of habitat hierarchy even though local environmental control of the biota decreased from the catchment to the region level. To capture most of headwater gamma-diversity, management should therefore target sites that are locally diverse, but at the same time select sites so that beta-diversity is maximized. As environmental control of the biota peaked at the catchment level, the conservation of headwater stream diversity is likely to be most effective when management targets environmental conditions across multiple local sites within relatively small catchments.

AB  - We used national scenario analyses to examine the effects of harvesting intensity on the development of forest resources, timber supply, carbon balance, and biodiversity indicators of Finnish forestry in nine 10-year simulation periods (90-year simulation period) under the current climate. Data from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland were used to develop five even-flow harvesting scenarios for non-protected forests with the annual harvest ranging from 40 to 100 million m(3). The results show that the highest annual even-flow harvest level, which did not decrease the growing stock volume over the 90-year simulation period, was 73 million m3. The total 90-year timber production, consisting of harvested volume and change in growing stock volume, was maximized when the annual harvest was 60 million m(3). Volume increment increased for several decades when harvested volume was less than the current volume increment. The total carbon balance of forestry was the highest with low volume of harvested wood. Low harvested volume increased the values of biodiversity indicators, namely volume of deciduous trees, amount of deadwood and area of old forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study the variation in species richness, species composition and habitat specificity is examined among all land patches in a 43-ha landscape in W Norway, created by traditional agricultural management practices, with particular focus on the distribution of semi-natural grassland species, i.e. species known to be typical of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. In 2002 about one half of the study area was intensively managed for agricultural purposes, 19.3% was woodland and 14.4% was semi-natural grassland. The main vegetation gradient in the area reflected long-term management (land-use) intensity. Both species richness and habitat specificity decreased with increasing management intensity. Semi-natural grassland species occurred throughout the landscape, although with some concentration to semi-natural grasslands. The two measures of habitat specificity both peaked in semi-natural grasslands. Comparison of the present patterns of vascular plant distributions with information on past land-use derived from a map from 1865, indicate that species typical of semi-natural grasslands persist long after land use activities have come to an end and that there is an extinction debt in the vascular flora. The significant positive relationship between patches with high richness of species typical of semi-natural grasslands, remnant semi-natural grassland patches and man-made structures with long continuity, shows that restoring formerly open semi-natural grassland 'hot spots' in a agricultural landscapes is advantageous both for conservation of cultural and biological values.

AB  - The expansion of wind energy over large areas may be accompanied by major conflicts with birds, including birds of prey. Hence, it is desirable that the space use of species known to be vulnerable to wind energy be assessed in light of current and future developments. Here, we report on the large-scale dispersal movements of pre-breeding white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Finland, where a currently modest wind-energy capacity is expected to increase in the near future. We studied white-tailed eagle space use with a particular focus on the potential for annual power production (GWh) at specific locations, as estimated by the Finnish Wind Atlas. Also, we aimed to detect a potential human-wildlife conflict by assessing white-tailed eagle space use against the spatial distribution of existing and recently proposed wind farms. We found that, despite visiting a large proportion of the country, the eagles stayed primarily within coastal areas and islands, restricted to where human infrastructure was present only at very small amounts. Because of the distribution of wind resources, such areas were found to contain considerable potential for power production. The eagles visited most of the areas targeted for wind-energy development. However, these areas did not coincide with a higher-than-average eagle relocation frequency, suggesting that the existing and recently proposed wind farms do not represent an elevated threat to dispersing eagles. Caution should nevertheless be taken against interpreting that co-occurrence poses no threat at any given site, as site selection is paramount to avoid conflicts with avian conservation.

AB  - Eutrophication assessments in water management to quantify nutrient loads and identify mitigating measures seldom include the contribution from horse facilities. This may be due to lack of appropriate methods, limited resources, or the belief that the impact from horses is insignificant. However, the recreational horse sector is growing, predominantly in multi-functional peri-urban landscapes. We applied an ecosystem management approach to quantify nutrient loads from horse facilities in the Stockholm Region, Sweden. We found that horses increased the total loads with 30-40% P and 20-45% N, with average area-specific loads of 1.2 kg P and 7.6 kg N ha-1 year-1. Identified local risk factors included manure management practices, trampling severity, soil condition and closeness to water. Comparisons of assessment methods showed that literature standard values of area-specific loads and water runoff may be sufficient at the catchment level, but in small and more complex catchments, measurements and local knowledge are needed.

Although the average number of disruptions per wind turbine only increased slightly from 2007 to 2009 in Sweden, the average downtime, the average electricity production loss and accordingly economic loss to the wind power operators increased 3 times during the same period. Equipped with strong production power, technology skills and expertize, Chinese wind turbine manufacturers have opportunity to enter the Swedish wind power maintenance and service market, and bring benefit to Swedish wind power industry and to themselves' internationalization process and sustainable development.

AB  - The rapid urbanization of land in the peri-urban West District surrounding Zanzibar city in Tanzania has occurred during a 20-year period of political and economic reform, with related reforms in the land sector. Utilizing 2006 and 2007 interviews with officials and residents alongside document and archival research, this study examines two themes in relation to Zanzibar's most prominent pro.gram of contemporary land reform, a Finnish-funded project for the Sustainable Management of Lands and Environment (SMOLE). These themes entail: (1) the importance of the historical-cultural geography of peri-urban land dynamics for dual reform (simultaneous political and economic reform) processes in Africa; and (2) the critique of pro-poor, neoliberal land reform for the disjunctures between its rhetoric, actual planning practice, and the beliefs and practices of the peri-urban poor, wherein we discover a lack of participation, transparency, or democracy in the land sector. The article's broader aim is to contribute a detailed African case study to urban political ecology's efforts to argue for democratization of the construction of social environments.

AB  - The moose (Alces alces) is the most intensely managed game species in Fennoscandia; approximately one-third of the population, ca. 160,000 animals, is harvested annually. Despite the species' biological and socioeconomic importance, there are knowledge gaps with respect to its intraspecific diversity and genetic structure. Recent studies of moose in neighboring countries report 2 genetic groups in Finland, 3 in Norway with one of them suggested to be of ancient origin, and no indications of bottlenecks. To delineate the spatial genetic landscape of the Swedish moose, we used allozyme variability from over 20,000 georeferenced moose collected all over Sweden in combination with 12 microsatellites (n = 1,200) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 44). We combined individual-based and traditional statistical approaches with coalescence-based simulations. The results indicate a complex history with bottlenecks and recent expansions that is consistent with historical records. Swedish moose are separated into 2 major genetic groups, a northern and a southern one, where the southern group is further divided into 3 subgroups. The 2 main subpopulations are moderately differentiated (F-ST = 0.1; R-ST = 0.07) and separated by sharp genetic discontinuities occurring over a relatively narrow transition zone in central Sweden that coincides with a similar, previously reported transition zone in Norway. This differentiation is not reflected in mtDNA variation, where no significant divergence was observed. Together with the F-ST andR(ST) similarities, this suggests that the 2 major subpopulations in Sweden reflect divergence shaped after the postglacial recolonization of Scandinavia. Neighborhood size assessments indicate that gene flow is relatively restricted with an estimated average dispersal distance of 3.5-11.1 km, and spatial autocorrelograms suggest that genetic similarity decreases almost linearly over space resulting in continuous genetic clines within major subgroups. Management areas largely coincide with genetic clusters, simplifying the integration of genetic information into management.

AB  - Replacing fossil jet fuel with biojet fuel is an important step towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation. To this end, Sweden has adopted a GHG mandate on jet fuel, complementing those on petrol and diesel. The GHG mandate on jet fuel requires a gradual reduction in the fuel's GHG emissions to up to 27% by 2030. This paper estimates the potential production of biojet fuel in Sweden for six integrated production pathways and analyzes what they entail with regard to net biomass input and the amount of hydrogen required for upgrading to fuel quality. Integrated production of biofuel intermediates from forestry residues and by-products at combined heat and power plants as well as at the forest industry, followed by upgrading to biojet fuel and other transportation fuels at a petroleum refinery, was assumed in all the pathways. The potential output of bio-based transportation fuels was estimated to 90 PJ/y, including 22 PJ/y of biojet fuel. The results indicate that it will be possible to meet the Swedish GHG mandate for jet fuel for 2030, although it will be difficult to simultaneously achieve the GHG mandates for road transportation fuels. This highlights the importance of pursuing complementary strategies for bio-based fuels.

AB  - This paper will report on the initial findings of an ongoing British Academy funded research project, the aim of which is to explore the potential of urban scale food governance for addressing the challenge of the de-animalisation of the food system. The research brings together and extends two largely discrete debates within social science research into the governance of transitions to a more sustainable agri-food system. The first debate concerns the 'animalisation' of the food system i.e. the over production and consumption of food from animals. This has been identified as a significant impediment to global food system sustainability with the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production highlighted as a major contributor to climate change. An increasingly diverse set of stakeholders argue that a more sustainable food system will need to place greater emphasis on plant sourced foods, hence 'de-animalisation'. However, resistance represents a challenge for research and practice. Research into (de)animalisation is emergent with analysis mostly undertaken at global and national scales neglecting other spaces of action including in particular the urban scale. Urban food governance is the second debate that frames the study. It represents another developing area of investigation which recognises that feeding the city is one of the 'quintessential' challenges of the 21st century. In response, urban governments across the globe have begun to develop a range of food plans, policies and strategies that help city governments integrate a full spectrum of urban food system issues within a single policy framework. Systematic research attention has yet to be given to how food governance at the urban scale is addressing the challenge of de-animalisation. The study reported here represents an initial attempt to address this gap and is being conducted in the UK and Finland, countries with contrasting approaches to the issue of interest. Findings will be presented from a literature review, document analysis of urban scale food provisioning initiatives and interviews with urban food governance stakeholders in the UK and Finland.

AB  - In order to achieve sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry, factors such as environment, economy and public opinions need to be accounted for. In this paper, we explore and compare attitudes towards the aquaculture industry in a statistical representative sample of Norwegians with attitudes in a representative sample from a local area where the aquaculture is highly present, also in Norway. Analysis of the national and local samples allows for investigation of how opinions towards aquaculture vary according to both demographical variables and geographical setting. Our findings suggest that being from an area where the industry dominates does not give one a more negative view of the environmental threat of the industry, but does make one less likely to believe that aquaculture activity creates local employment. In addition, the results show that in a community where the aquaculture industry dominates, negative attitudes towards aquaculture are not primarily due to its perceived environmental impact, but rather due to conflicts of interest and to whether aquaculture activity is perceived to create jobs locally or not.

   2. Quantitative analysis of habitat preference and avoidance on a large scale indicated that bats were flexible, yet consistent in their habitat use across contrasting landscapes. Habitats associated with broadleaved woodland and water were most preferred, while arable land, moorland and improved grassland were strongly avoided. Linear vegetation features were selected in all landscapes. demonstrating the importance of habitat continuity to bats, The availability of preferred habitats was low and patchy in all landscapes, indicating that bats have specialized habitat requirements. Differences in habitat selection between landscape types and possible factors influencing habitat selection are discussed.
   3. Habitat selection analysed on a local scale demonstrated the same consistent preference for woodland, riparian and corridor habitats across 19 discrete land classes.
   4. Management policies for bats in Britain should endeavour to preserve and enhance the availability of woodland, water margins and linear corridor habitats. Lack of continuity of the landscape, loss and fragmentation of habitat patches plus deterioration of the quality of such patches may pose a threat to bat populations.

AB  - The European Union has made the development of a vibrant knowledge-based economy a key policy objective. and increasingly national and local governments worldwide are seeking to harness information and communication technologies to provide government services more effectively and for the benefit of their citizenry. The paper reports on the first phase of the ongoing European Union IntelCities integrated project that seeks to integrate electronic governance of cities and urban planning. The background to the project in terms of the e-Europe Action Plan is explored and the outcome of surveys of user needs and requirements carried out in the cities of Marseilles (France), Siena and Rome (Italy), Helsinki (Finland), Leicester and Manchester (UK), and Dresden and Bertin (Germany) are explained. The outcomes identify a range of implications for digital or electronic planning in terms of increasing the efficiency in e-urban planning and the need to develop digital methodologies for widening public participation. Thus. the importance of e-skills development in new forms of e-planning for planners, developers and citizens is highlighted and shown to be important for achieving a wider e-enabled sustainable knowledge society.

AB  - We Studied changes in habitat selection of capercaillie in northern Finnish boreal forests at two spatial scales during two time periods, 1989-1992 and 2000-2003. We studied capercaillie densities and their changes between the study periods in relation to the landscape class proportions within 3-km buffer zones around the wildlife triangle center points. Furthermore, we compared the landscape class proportions in 800-meter buffer zones around capercaillie wildlife triangle count observations and around the counted wildlife triangle transects using t-tests and compositional analysis. At the local Population scale (3 km) the change in adult density between the study periods was associated positively with the proportion Of Young thinning stands in 2003 and reversely with the mature stand (1992 and 2003) and clear-cut (1992) proportions. Capercaillie juvenile and pooled densities during 2000-2003 were positively associated with the advanced thinning stand proportion in 2003. At the capercaillie home range scale (800 m) habitats were rich in mature stands during 1989-1992 in relation to available habitats, but not during 2000-2003 when young thinning stands were more abundant in relation to available habitats. Relatively young managed forests can be suitable for capercaillie, but mature managed forests as capercaillie habitats may have deteriorated between the study periods. Spatial planning may help to form suitable areas that are large enough for the species, but the highest potential may Jay in the forest stand scale, where increased cover on the ground Could promote the habitat quality.

AB  - The quantitative archaeological record of the & Aring;land Islands (Finland) indicates a population boom in the mid-sixth century CE. Yet the number of palynological investigations on & Aring;land is limited, resulting in a knowledge gap of anthropogenic landscape modification generated by the land use that followed the increased population. This article presents the results of a pollen analysis from Lake Lavsb & ouml;le Tr & auml;sk in central & Aring;land, covering the period from the end of the Bronze Age into the modern period. The results of this study provide evidence of continuous land use throughout the Iron Age and the medieval period, and the population boom during the sixth century CE is indicated in the pollen signal. Altogether we argue for an economy based on cereal cultivation, animal husbandry, and maritime resource utilization (e.g. seal hunting, fishing, and fowling) as well as trading. The results indicate a society able to manage risks connected to their subsistence strategies, in which versatility seems to have had a key role.

AB  - The Finnish anthropogenic CH, emissions in 1990 are estimated to be about 250 Gg, with an uncertainty range extending from 160 to 440 Gg. The mast important sources are landfills and animal husbandry. The N2O emissions, which come mainly from agriculture and the nitric acid industry are about 20 Gg in 1990 (uncertainty range 10-30 Gg). The development of the emissions to the year 2010 is reviewed in two scenarios: the base and the reduction scenarios.
   According to the base scenario, the Finnish CH, emissions will decrease in the near future. Emissions from landfills, energy production, and transportation will decrease because of already decided and partly realized volume and technical changes in these sectors. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is considered achievable.
   N2O emissions, on the other hand, are expected to increase as emissions from energy production and transportation will grow due to an increasing use of fluidized bed boilers and catalytic converters in cars. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is optimistic.
   Anthropogenic CH4 and N2O emissions presently cause about 30% of the direct radiative forcing due to Finnish anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This share would be even larger if the indirect impacts of CH4 were included. The contribution of CH4 can be controlled due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime and due to the existing emission reduction potential. Nitrous oxide has a long atmospheric lifetime and its emission control possiblities are limited; consequently, the greenhouse impact of N2O seems to be increasing even if the emissions were limited somehow.

AB  - The aim is to study how ideologies come through in urban regeneration plans. Neo-liberalism, participatory democracy and environmentalism are systems of ideas competing for the minds of citizens in large parts of the world. Typical urban policies linked to each ideology are listed to provide a basis for identifying features of development plans that reflect aspirations for an entrepreneurial, green or open and inclusive society. A case study from Trondheim, Norway, maps ideological traces in waterfront development plans. The central question to be addressed is whether the internationally widespread allegations of neo-liberal hegemony over urban plans are reasonable. In light of the case data, it can be questioned whether neo-liberal ideology, although influential, is hegemonic in the plans. This doubt lingers, even if the chosen case Nedre Elvehavn is the kind of large-scale transformation of former dockyards close to the central business district that is often regarded as prototypical neo-liberal development in academic planning literature.

AB  - Owing to the internationalisation of the forestry debate and forest policy, there is growing need to conduct comparative forest policy research at an international scale. This research compares environmental conflicts in forestry in seven cases during 1984-1995. The cases include Finland, France, Minnesota USA, Norway, Pacific Northwest USA, Sweden and West Germany. The research is based on the notion that each society has its own 'cultural' ways of producing and managing environmental conflicts in forestry, depending on the social, political, economic, and resource characteristics of the society. The purpose of the study is to describe these conflict cultures, to identify and analyse the societal aspects that impact them, and to discuss the implications of understanding conflicts as cultural phenomena. The research is based on focused interviews of multiple actors related to forest management and protection. For the data analysis, a 'hermeneutic' (interpretative and understanding) approach is introduced to Qualitative Comparative Analysis, the use of which has been dominated by causal applications. As a result of the analysis, models of conflict cultures and conflict management strategies are constructed. The model of conflict cultures indicates three basic dimensions of conflict culture, and defines how they are related to each other. These dimensions are mild vs. intense conflicts, separatist vs. co-operative relations between actors and stability vs. change in forest resource policy and use. The model of conflict management strategies indicates to what extent the different cases place emphasis on interactive vs. institutional conflict management, and the management of conflicting (sub)cultures within the society vs. the conflict culture of the society.

AB  - This paper investigates chain hotel employees in Sweden and their ability to work against sex trafficking. Using ten semi-structured interviews, the research asks questions about employee's relationships with external stakeholders (the police, booking channels, non-profit organizations, and competitors) and macroenvironmental factors (political and legal factors, economic, socio-cultural and health). The findings highlight that lack of communication, cooperation and autonomy hinder chain hotel employee's ability to recognize and prevent sex trafficking. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for better interdisciplinary engagement to help eliminate sex trafficking within the tourism and hospitality industries and reiterates the call for actionable outcomes that empower chain hotel employees to work with external stakeholders to find viable solutions to help stop sex trafficking.

AB  - Degradation of freshwater ecosystems has engendered legislative mandates for the protection and management of surface waters while groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) have received much less attention. This is so despite biodiversity and functioning of GDEs are currently threatened by several anthropogenic stressors, particularly intensified land use and groundwater contamination. We assessed the impacts of land drainage (increased input of dissolved organic carbon, DOC, from peatland drainage) and impaired groundwater chemical quality (NO3--N enrichment from agricultural or urban land use) on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in 20 southern Finnish cold-water springs using several taxonomic and functional measures. Groundwater contamination decreased macroinvertebrate and bacterial diversity and altered their community composition. Changes in macroinvertebrate and bacterial communities along the gradient of water-quality impairment were caused by the replacement of native with new taxa rather than by mere disappearance of some of the original taxa. Also species richness of habitat specialist (but not headwater generalist) bryophytes decreased due to impaired groundwater quality. Periphyton accrual rate showed a subsidy-stress response to elevated nitrate concentrations, with peak values at around 2500 mu g L-1, while drainage-induced spring water brownification (increased DOC) reduced both periphyton accrual and leaf decomposition rates already at very low concentrations. Our results highlight the underutilized potential of ecosystem-level functional measures in GDE bioassessment as they seem to respond to the first signs of spring ecosystem impairment, at least for the anthropogenic stressors studied by us.

AB  - Forestry has altered the boreal flora and fauna strongly during the 1900s. At present, logging methods other than clear-cutting are often applied but the ecological effects of these modifications are poorly studied. I collected carabid beetles in 8 uncut, 8 thinned (10%-30% -of trees removed, with the aim of generating an uneven age structure) and 8 clear-cut, spruce-dominated stands, by using pitfall traps in central Finland during 1995-1998. The c rabid species fell into three distinctive ecological groups in the multivariate analyses: forest, open-habitat and Sphagnum bog species. The forest species further formed a continuum from forest specialists to canopy-closure generalists. Logging affected the forest species slightly, while generalists and open-habitat species benefitted from clear-cutting. Thinning maintained the forest-floor carabid assemblage well. Site characteristics, such as the amount of trees and bottom and field-layer vegetation, were important determinants of carabid assemblages. Certain within-stand habitat types (e.g. spruce mires) were shown to be important for carabid diversity and should be managed with methods other than clear-cutting, in order to avoid extinctions of local populations. Increasing distance to the nearest source habitat had a negative effect on the abundance and distribution of carabids. Therefore, landscape-level forestry planning is also important for the maintenance of forest-species assemblages.

AB  - Retrofit of existing housing increases the possibility of meeting Sustainable Development Goals. Improving quality of life, minimising energy consumption and increasing productivity in buildings process with the aim of affordable housing (social, environmental, and economic sustainability) set new demands for renovation amongst residential housing in Norway. Most studies to date emphasised on mitigation of CO2 emissions in building sector through building renovations. However, recent studies started evaluating why such renovation plans may not be considered by property owners. This study investigates potential barriers and motivations for Sustainable Building Renovations (SBR) from house-owners' perspective and discusses the role of urban Facility Management (FM) in promoting SBR. Results from a questionnaire survey with 341 citizens in Trondheim city, Norway, confirm economic issues as the main barrier for SBR with respondents suggesting different forms of financial support to resolve these barriers. Social engagement of citizens with public/private partners and neighbours illustrates the collective motivation for SBR. This requires an intermediary role like urban FM engaging citizens to co-create their needs in urban areas with public/private sectors. The output of this study helps to promote urban FM engaging with SBR targets through renovation of neighbourhoods.

AB  - Winter sport and nature-related tourism are growing fast at North European mountain resorts, where ecosystems are vulnerable to changes. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how natural constraints and land-use strategies steer the development of tourism infrastructure in subarctic mountain resorts. Furthermore, an indicator for monitoring and evaluating ongoing development was created. For the study objectives, landscape structures of two subarctic mountain resorts in Finnish Lapland were modelled by the visual overlapping of 3D-terrain models and erosion vulnerability maps of soils and vegetation with the geographical information system. Four landscape zones were separated on the ground of their overall erosion resistance. Additionally, hectares of built-up areas were transformed to spatial data of the most vulnerable summit and upper slope zones. The statistic indicates the clear cutting volume of the high altitudes and predicts erosion risk. The findings indicated that resorts have locked on a pro-growth mode, which threatens the fundamental flows between subarctic mountain ecosystems and may affect visitors' contentment in the long run. Simple models are suggested for discussion of acceptable changes to conditions in mountain resorts.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, new infrastructure projects and other land use changes must be considered on landscape and regional scales. This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels.
   In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level.

AB  - The impacts of forest fragmentation, agricultural land and habitat structure on depredation of artificial ground nests were studied in the cultivated area in central Finland and in the forest dominated area in Finnish Lapland. The overall predation rate did not differ between the regions. The overall predation rate was also independent of landscape characteristics forest patch size and the distance to patch edge. However, nest predation was clearly affected by the agricultural land since the robbing rate in forest edges was higher near farmlands than further away. This effect was caused by avian predators which proportional importance in predation was higher in the agricultural landscape than in the forest landscape. In both regions, depredation correlated positively with high numbers of pine and spruce. This can be mainly explained by the preference of predators over coniferous forest habitat as a living or hunting area.

AB  - We studied the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation and their interaction on the persistence of Capercaillie lekking areas at three study areas in Finland. We inspected a total of 381 leks twice with an interval of 10-30 years, and classified them as persisting versus ceased leks. We attempted to explain the persistence of Capercaillie leks with forest cover and fine-grain fragmentation at two spatial scales (within 1,000 m and 3,000 m from the leks) by using satellite-image based forest-inventory data. We statistically removed the effect of forest cover from the measure of fragmentation, and used information-theoretical model selection to evaluate a set of logistic regression analyses. Fine-grain forest fragmentation had a positive effect on lek persistence. Forest cover positively affected lek persistence only when considering the landscapes surrounding the leks (within 3,000 m radius). In addition, we found a significant negative interaction between forest cover and fragmentation. Under conditions of low forest cover, patch configuration may become increasingly important for the persistence of lekking areas. According to our results, the most effective management strategies for Capercaillie lekking areas include maximizing the amount of forest around the lekking areas, and encouraging mosaic-like variability of the forest.

AB  - The way in which we produce and consume energy has profound implications for our societies. How we configure our energy systems determines not only our chances of successfully dealing with climate change but also, how benefits and burdens of these systems are distributed. In this paper, we set out to map the literature on conflicts related to the energy system in Sweden using a framework of energy justice. The purpose of this exercise is twofold: first, to identify and understand energy conflicts in Sweden through the research that is published; and second, to identify gaps in the literature on energy justice in Sweden. This systematic review builds upon 40 scholarly articles focusing on energy conflicts in Sweden. All articles were written in the time period from January 2010 to January 2021. All articles were published in English in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The papers were analysed using a framework for energy justice that focused on the elements of distributional and procedural justice and recognition justice. The findings of the review suggest that there has been little explicit focus on energy justice in the literature on Sweden's energy system. Issues of distributional justice are most raised and procedural and recognition justice are often conflated in research. While conflicts over hydropower and nuclear have dominated in the past, wind energy in Sami territory is most problematised in the reviewed literature. The understanding of justice in the Swedish energy system is currently missing two elements: a rigorous handling of ecologically unequal exchange and restorative justice.

AB  - Extensive utilisation of logging residues, straw, and energy crops will lead to short transportation distances and thus low transportation costs. The average distance of transportation of biomass to a large-scale conversion plant, suitable for electricity or methanol production using 300 000 dry tonne biomass yearly, will be about 30 km in Sweden, if the conversion plant is located at the centre of the biomass production area The estimated Swedish biomass potential of 430 PJ/yr is based on production conditions around 2015, assuming that 30% of the available arable land is used for energy crop production. With present production conditions, resulting in a biomass potential of 220 PJ/yr, the transportation distance is about 42 km. The cost of transporting biomass 30-42 km will be equivalent to 20-25% of the total biomass cost. The total energy efficiency of biomass production and transportation will be 95-97%, where the energy losses from transportation are about 20%. Biomass transportation will contribute less than 10% to the total NOx, CO, and HC emissions from biomass production, transportation, and conversion.

AB  - This article examines biodiversity conservation in commercial boreal forests. The means of promoting biodiversity are green tree retention and prolonged rotation age, which create dead and decaying wood artificially and via natural mortality, respectively. We extend the Hartman model to cover biodiversity benefits and to allow for leaving retention trees standing at the final felling. We first characterize qualitatively the socially optimal choice of the harvest volume and rotation age. We then assess empirically the optimal solution in a simulation model calibrated to the Finnish forestry for a pine stand. We find that biodiversity conservation increases the socially optimal rotation age beyond the Faustmann rotation age. The optimal volume of retention trees increases (decreases) with biodiversity valuation (timber price). The optimal retention volume is higher than suggested by the current forest management recommendations or certification systems.

AB  - During the past few decades, the Swedish spatial planning system has experienced numerous problems and challenges. In particular, there have been changes in legislation and an increased neoliberalisation of planning that gives private actors a larger influence over the planning processes in Sweden. In this article, we analyse these changes through the lenses of collaborative and neoliberal planning in order to illuminate the shifting power relations within spatial planning in Sweden. We analyse the changes of power relations from three dimensions of power based on interviews with different kinds of planners throughout Sweden. We show that power relations in the Swedish spatial planning system have shifted and that neoliberalisation and an increased focus on collaborative planning approaches have made spatial planning more complex in recent decades. This has led to a change of role for planners form actual planners to collaborators. We conclude that market-oriented planning (neoliberal planning) and collaborative planning have made it more difficult for spatial planners in Sweden to work towards sustainable urban futures.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands in Sweden are species-rich, and their natural values are strongly dependent on continuous management, mainly by grazing. However, the large heterogeneity in vegetation within and between grassland sites must be taken into account when designing management and preservation schemes, calling for precise field monitoring and assessment of habitat type and land use history. We have evaluated different surrogate measures to assess community composition and biodiversity of the most common vegetation types in grazed semi-natural pastures. We compared the complete plant community, two reduced checklists intended for quick surveys of the plant community, and the ant community. The results suggest that the taxonomic resolution in a plant inventory is important for both biodiversity assessment and recognition of vegetation types. The extent of a reduced species checklist was of greater importance than its quality for describing the plant community. Reduced checklists should only be used if they comprise species with known affinity to the studied vegetation types. We also found that plants and ants experience grazed semi-natural grasslands in different ways. Ant communities did not resemble the communities deduced from plant inventories, or vegetation types recognised by field staff.

TI  - Summer loggings and bird protection: On regulation and derogations
T2  - REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA  - English
AB  - Forest loggings during the nesting season are increasing in Finland. The aim of this article is to evaluate how current regulation applies to summer loggings, paying special attention to the protection of birds. The European Union Birds Directive and the Finnish Nature Conservation Act prohibit the deliberate killing and disturbance of birds. Regardless, it seems that in practice none of these rules is applied to birds and summer loggings as forestry is not considered 'deliberate' killing or disturbance, even if thousands of birds are killed in summer loggings every year. European biodiversity targets and the principle of minimizing harms would emphasize implementing and monitoring existing national law and soft law more actively than currently is the case.

AB  - The well-known and much investigated rise of urban entrepreneurial policies has fuelled a transformation of urban spaces and landscapes, and has led to changes in the social composition of city centres. This is the case for Oslo, Norway's capital, where increasingly urban policies are designed to attract transnational companies and those in the creative class. A key strategy to achieve this has been to transform the city's waterfront through spectacular architecture and urban design, as has taken place in other European cities. Transnational and local architects have been commissioned to design the Barcode, one of the most striking waterfront projects. This article investigates the role of architecture and architects in this process, because architects can be seen as influential generators of urban spaces and agents for social change, and because there is remarkably little published empirical research on this specific role of architects. It is argued that although there was an overall planning goal that the projects along the waterfront of Oslo should contribute to social sustainability, with the implication that planners and architects possessed information about the local urban context and used this knowledge, in practice this was not the case. It is demonstrated that the architects paid little attention to the social, cultural and economic contexts in their design process. Rather, the architects emphasized the creation of an exciting urban space and, in particular, designed spectacular architecture that would contribute to the merits of the firms involved. It is further argued that because of this the Barcode project will not contribute to the making of a just city.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse how and why domestic forest policies in Europe have responded to pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation, climate and bioenergy policies. We use content analysis of documents and interviews to analyse change and stability in domestic forest policy goals, instruments and practices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over time. We find that decision-makers in forest policy and practice responded to pressure to integrate biodiversity into forestry through four different types of policy change outcomes and processes. Depending on the context, these responses included layering, drift, conversion and/or replacement. In all countries, the forest policy changes were driven by (partly shifting) coalitional politics and changes in external conditions. Domestic forest policy regimes shifted from 'timber production' towards 'multifunctional', 'sustainable forest management' or 'biodiversity' primacy, and then back to 'timber harvesting'. Forest policy also integrated bioenergy and climate change policies in order to minimise pressure by EU and national biodiversity policy sectors and to enable 'timber harvesting' (re-)turns in forest policy. We conclude that policy integration processes and the shifts in forest policy they contain refer to a sectoral resilience, that is, the ability of forest policy to react to, minimise, and absorb pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation policies.

AB  - In this article we explore the hidden gender order of the biodiversity policy and, in particular, the social and societal positions offered to male and female forest owners in voluntary conservation. Two studies were conducted in the region where the National Biodiversity Program for Southern Finland ("METSO") has been implemented. Study 1 focused on forest owners' discursive practices that construct different actor positions to female and male forest owners; 27 interviews with forest owners were analyzed. Three discourses - "conservation threatens forestry," "forestry threatens conservation," and "good forestry is conservation" - were identified. Forest owners typically described themselves as "loggers" who were explicitly described as masculine. This was paired with the feminine position of "bystander." The other two positions found, "protectors" and "political agents", by contrast, were discussed as non-gendered positions. In Study 2 we examined quantitatively how individual forest owners' nature conservation preferences and willingness to conserve forests is mediated by gender. The responses of 965 owners were analyzed with structural equation modeling. The endorsement of nature conservation preferences was found to increase willingness to conserve forests only among male owners. The results illustrate how individual forest owners adapt their nature conservation preferences to forestry's masculine sociocultural context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wind power has become an increasingly important source of renewable energy in Norway. Current demand and production capacity have exceeded expectations stipulated in energy policies a few years back. Wind power affects landscape characteristics, and the rapid development has created considerable public conflict. However, knowledge to date about public attitudes toward wind power development in Norway is limited. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public to examine relationships between wind power development and place attachment, localization, and policies. We also examined if attitudes toward wind power are linked to broader environmental attitudes and meaning of place. Public attitudes range from strong support to strong opposition. We found limited support for NIMBY effects. Support versus opposition correlates with attitudes toward place attachment, localization of wind power plants and energy policies. We found evidence of a dichotomy between the more fundamental world views of eco-modernism versus de-growth influencing the more specific wind power attitudes. We argue that policy institutions have underestimated the power of attitude diversity in the wind power debate, and that social acceptability of future wind power development will depend on improved understanding of how social values of landscapes are impacted.

AB  - Forest certification has emerged as a voluntary, market-driven tool for sustainable forest management (SFM). Its legitimacy depends on its ability to achieve its objectives and to retain the support of stakeholders such as NGOs and the companies that adopt it. This study presents a novel approach for assessing the contributions of forest certification to biodiversity conservation, based on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in four northern European countries (Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia). In each case, national FSC certification requirements related to specific biodiversity targets were compared with requirements in national legislation. Nearly 80% of the assessed certification requirements were more prescriptive than the national legislation. Onethird of these requirements (3-8 per country) were assessed to have a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation, whereas four requirements (up to 2 per country) were assessed to have a low positive contribution. FSC requirements to protect Woodland Key Habitats were identified as having a positive contribution in all four countries, whereas requirements regarding live tree retention in harvests and preserving dead wood had a positive contribution in three countries each. Despite often prescribing similar measures, the other requirements with positive contributions varied between countries depending on the national legislative baseline. The remaining requirements could not be assessed through expert evaluation, indicating the need for additional empirical research to evaluate how the normative requirements translate to impacts in the field, and how the national context may affect their implementation. The approach is globally applicable, repeatable, and provides a basis for designing systematic empirical assessments of the certification impact.

AB  - The global demand for renewable energy is on the rise. Expansion of onshore wind energy is in many parts of the world limited by societal acceptance, and also ecological impacts are a concern. Here, pragmatic methods are developed for the integration of high-dimensional spatial data in offshore wind energy planning. Over 150 spatial data layers are created, which either oppose or support offshore wind energy development, and represent ecological, societal, and economic factors. The method is tested in Finland, where interest in developing offshore wind energy is growing. Analyses were done using a spatial prioritization approach, originally developed for the prioritization of high dimensional ecological data, and rarely used in planning offshore wind energy. When all criteria are integrated, it is possible to find a balanced solution where offshore wind farms cause little disturbance to biodiversity and society, while at the same time yielding high profitability for wind energy production. Earlier proposed areas for offshore wind farms were also evaluated. They were generally well suited for wind power, with the exception of a couple of areas with comparatively high environmental impacts. As an outcome, new areas well suited for large scale wind power deployment were recognized, where construction costs would be moderate and disturbance to biodiversity, marine industries and people limited. A novel tradeoff visualization method was also developed for the conflicts and synergies of offshore energy deployment, which could ease the dialogue between different stakeholders in a spatial planning context. Overall, this study provides a generic and transparent approach for well-informed analysis of offshore wind energy development potential when conflict resolution between biodiversity, societal factors and economic profits is needed. The proposed approach is replicable elsewhere in the world. It is also structurally suitable for the planning of impact avoidance and conflict resolution in the context of other forms of construction or resource extraction.

AB  - Due to the fragmented organizational landscape characterizing public transport, it is important to study and explore how regional governance of public transport adapts to national institutional reforms. By employing the term governance cultures' to a comparative case study of regional public transport planning in Sweden, we contribute to theories of governance by cultural sensitization. Combining governance theory with cultural analysis, we apply a cultural perspective to understand the two cases. We conclude that public transport planning in the Stockholm region is defined by negotiations' between stakeholders, whereas in the Vastra Gotaland region it is characterized by a governance culture of collaboration'. The evidence from our case studies emphasizes the importance of understanding local governance practices as situated in cultural contexts as well as of viewing governance cultures as an important factor affecting the purpose, degree and outcomes of collaboration in planning practices.

AB  - To assess the biodiversity consequences of contemporary land-use trends in Northern Europe, where agriculture is being replaced by forestry, we need a better knowledge of the contributions of constituting habitats to biodiversity. Here, we use purposefully collected data from 87 sites to model how agricultural habitats, including semi-natural pastures, sown temporary grassland (leys), cereal crops, and forest habitats comprising both mature production forests and clear-cuts, contribute to landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in boreonemoral Sweden. At the local scale, species richness was highest in semi-natural pastures, intermediate in cereal crops and leys and lowest in forest. In clear-cuts, species richness was similarly high to that in semi-natural pastures. Countryside species-area models show that at a landscape scale, the high local richness in clear-cuts was more than offset by the low species richness encountered in forest. At landscape scale, semi-natural pastures, and in the case of plants also cereal crops, were major contributors of unique species. Leys and semi-natural pastures were both important contributors to bumblebee diversity. The effect of the surrounding landscape composition on local diversity was weak, suggesting that area-based approximations of landscape-scale species richness were reasonable. We conclude that clear-cuts constitute habitats for open-land species but cannot maintain landscape -scale diversity in the face of agricultural abandonment when open land is replaced by even-aged production forests. Maintaining farmland, in particular semi-natural pastures but also cereals and leys, is therefore critical to maintaining the landscape-scale species richness of plants and insects in forestry-dominated areas.

AB  - Increasing tourism in northern Finland produces challenges for tourist centres, their land use plans and sustainable development. Increasing activities in areas that are sensitive to environmental changes need solutions for sustainable land use. Equipment to minimize environmental effects, and the planning of ecologically, culturally, and visually sustainable built up areas at popular tourist centres on the Yllas and Levi fells are investigated in the LANDSCAPE LAB project. The project is partly financed by the EU LIFE Environment and the Geological Survey of Finland is involved as a partner. Geological factors such as the quality and composition of bedrock, the maturity of the matrix of surficial sediments, and geomorphology affect the resistance to erosion in different geoenvironments. In Fermoscandia, the glacial erosion has been intensive and the terrain is composed of eroded hill slopes and glacial landforms. Traditionally, in Finland, erosion resistance of nature trails has focused on vegetation and trampling resistance. The erosion rate is studied mainly by measuring the width and depth of the path and the amount of exposed roots and stones. Geological factors are not studied for nature trails, but geology and geological factors are the basic elements affecting resistance to erosion and should be included in land use planning. Careful planning and monitoring are the keys to creating visually impressive and geologically sustainable nature trails.

AB  - Non-market values pose a challenge in decision making. In a contribution to the issue, the study assesses the potential positive impact on residents' wellbeing of improving the ecological status of water bodies making up the Saarija center dot rvi watercourse in Central Finland, a region with numerous Natura areas. The benefits provided by the aquatic environment and the factors affecting them were assessed using the contingent valuation method (CVM). A split-sample design made it possible to analyse expressed uncertainty with two payment vehicles: in one, the question of uncertainty was included in the willingness-to-pay (WTP) questions (multiple bounded discrete choice, MBDC); in the other, it was queried separately after the payment card (PC) question. Where respondents saw added value in Natura 2000 sites and received new information on water management, they experienced increased wellbeing from improved water quality. Perceived importance of sustainable hydropower and water regulation also figured in a desire to improve the ecological status of waters in the region. The results show that there is a noticeable positive WTP among residents (N = 473) for improved water status and that estimated WTP differs according to uncertainty: mean WTP every year per individual fell in the range EUR 29.70 to EUR 75.50. Improvement of water status and protection of Natura 2000 sites were found to be mutually reinforcing goals. Higher net social benefits could be realized if implementation of the applicable directives were more closely coupled to regional planning.

AB  - To substructure the hypothesis that ecological agriculture positively contributes to landscape quality, a methodology has been developed that evaluates a broad range of components of the cultural landscape based on sets of objective and subjective criteria. This methodology aims to be a feasible regional planning tool Europe-wide and has subsequently been tested and improved in several European regions, the latest in Western Norway. This article presents the results of the farm and landscape quality assessments by an international group of experts of various disciplines and its possible implications for regional planning in a specific local situation. In an interdisciplinary approach two different organic farms in the impressive Norwegian fjord landscape were comparatively studied, especially with respect to their contributions to landscape quality, with emphasis on sensorial perceptions (subjective appreciation) and landscape identity issues (objective appreciation). Moreover, the preservation of values at landscape level as well as the meaning of the cultural landscape values for the local population are discussed. Landscape qualities in the study area are related to nature and cultural heritage values, but these values are declining without active human involvement. The methodology as developed so far appeared useful in demonstrating the values of the landscape and elements in the region to different stakeholder groups, especially with respect to local and regional planning processes. Both the organic farms, as part of the landscape, provide important contributions to the cultural and ecological values of the landscape, but according to the assessment results these contributions are different in quality.

AB  - Russia accounts for approximately 20% of the world's forest cover. More than 59% of the total territory of the Russian Federation is classified as forest land. However, the forest sector contributes only 1.3% to Russian gross domestic product and the Russian forest industry accounts for less than 4% of the world's forest products trade. This paper analyzes the most significant challenges facing Russian forest management including example of wood chips export to the EU and will suggest specific policy proposals that could be made in order to improve the forest management and forest transportation in Russia. Russian forestry has a lot of challenges such as lack of proper forest infrastructure, inadequate forest fire protection, unqualified personnel and unclear legislation. Most of these challenges are linked to one another and solving one problem can lead to the solution of others. The improvement of Russian forest governance is difficult and hard for policy, but without significant changes in current Russian forest management practices, forest degradation in Russia will continue to increase. The degradation of Russian forests could lead to a loss of global resources in general.

AB  - The nature areas surrounding the capital of Norway (Oslomarka), comprising 1 700 km(2) of forest land, are the recreational home turf for a population of 1.2 mill. people. These areas are highly valuable, not only for recreational purposes and biodiversity, but also for commercial activities. To assess the impacts of the challenges that Oslo municipality forest face in their management, we developed four optimization problems with different levels of management constraints. The constraints consider control of harvest level, guarantee of minimum old-growth forest area and maximum open area after final harvest. For the latter, to date, no appropriate analyses quantifying the impact of such a constraint on economy and biomass production have been carried out in Norway. The problem solved is large due to both the number of stands and number of treatment schedules. However, the model applied demonstrated its relevance for solving large problems involving maximum opening areas. The inclusion of maximum open area constraints caused 7.0% loss in NPV compared to the business as usual case with controlled harvest volume and minimum old-growth area. The estimated supply of 20-30 GWh annual energy from harvest residues could provide a small, but stable supply of energy to the municipality.

AB  - As resources allocated specifically for conservation are limited, there is a need to ensure conservation policy initiatives lead to effective conservation outcomes. In this study, we investigated the potential conservation benefits from alternative spatial allocations of old deciduous stands to a landscape dominated by coniferous production forests owned primarily by non-industrial private forest owners. As a target species, we used the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus), a species associated with deciduous forests and known to be sensitive to isolation. We used a previously published model based on empirical data on the occurrence of this species, to assess the probability of occurrence of the bird in a 4,000 km(2) area in southern Sweden for which we possess detailed spatial GIS data (kNN data) of tree species composition and age. We assessed alternative scenarios where old deciduous forest was allocated with or without respect to distance from existing old deciduous forests. Due to the long-tailed tit's habitat requirement increasing the amount of old deciduous forests close to existing habitats was the most effective strategy. However, the potential advantages of this strategy may in fact be overturned in favor of the other scenarios if ownership structures and probable uptake rates of policy initiatives are also considered. If a policy initiative is targeted toward owners with properties in close proximity to existing suitable habitat, when compared to if all forest owners are targeted, a higher proportion of owners is needed to participate in order to achieve the same degree of habitat creation for the species. Here, we discuss the potential benefits for effective conservation policy formulation from integrating spatially explicit datasets and detailed ecological knowledge with land-ownership structures and policy uptake scenarios.

AB  - This paper considers rural land use by analysing stakeholder values and perceptions concerning various landscape components. The purpose is to show that landscape content and land cover interactions with societal connections should be a base for land use development. The practical goal is to deliberate research tools to quantify public opinions and attitudes, which could form bases for developing of decision support tools. The main research objectives are: (1) to assess existing opinions concerning land use changes and provide a clearer insight into public attitudes to the role of woodlands for an integrated development of the countryside; (2) to place ecological and socio-economic values on inanimate natural components of landscapes; and (3) to assess values and preferences held by land use policy and management experts regarding multiple landscape components and features to assist in decision-making. Through the different levels of importance (values) accorded by the respondents to the integration of nature components in rural landscapes public priorities were identified. The paper develops an understanding of why certain aspects of land use changes are unfavourably viewed by some people and favourably received by others. It suggests some innovative perspectives on the areas of consensus and conflict between people, providing initial information for the selection and evaluation of land use management decisions.

AB  - The concept of a 'nexus' across issues regarding the management of natural resources has gained increasing academic attention in recent years, but there is still relatively limited research on the application of the nexus approach for evaluating policies. This study analyses coherence among the main goals of five policy areas (water, energy, food, land, and climate) in Sweden, drawing upon a desk review, expert assessment, and interaction with stakeholders. The main objective is to enhance understanding of opportunities and challenges posed by such a nexus, understand policy interactions in Sweden, and provide insights into the use of policy coherence analysis as an integral part of resource nexus assessments. The analysis reveals synergies and conflicts between policy goals. For example, Sweden's environmental quality objectives (EQOs) regarding land and all the goals regarding water are either synergistic or neutral. Likewise, climate policy goals are well aligned with the goals regarding energy and ground water quality. On the other hand, the key goal for agriculture, which is food production, is the least coherent with those of the other policy areas. There are conflicts between the EQOs and goals regarding agricultural and forestry production. Stakeholders also indicate that climate goals are treated with higher priority than the goals of other policy areas. Notably, some interactions between policy goals are synergistic or conflicting depending on the context or their interpretation. Implementation of existing goals depends on relevant stakeholders' interests, priorities and interpretations, and on existing prevailing discourses in society, often supported by higher level policies.

AB  - Loss of boreal wetlands in Finland has negative consequences for waders, ducks and local socio-ecological systems. These changes result from over 70-years of human-made alterations to land and waterscapes. Climate change and associated extreme events are expected to be further drivers of negative change. In order to build resilience and seek answers to these challenges, a five-year monitoring of Linnunsuo, a 120-ha human-made wetland was conducted. Wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) and Northern pintail (Anus acuta) were the indicator species. Analysis of co-management complemented the review. Results indicate that the creation of well-designed wetlands has the potential to increase resilience of these socio-ecological systems. They are cost-effective and can be replicated across the boreal region to address the need of habitat loss and climate impacts.

AB  - The agricultural products consumed in Finland are increasingly grown on foreign farms. We analyze the Finnish imports of food and feed crops from 1986 to 2011 by products and by their geographic origin drawing a link to environmental impacts. The share of foreign crops consumed in Finland nearly doubled in the study period. The imports increased especially with commodities that could also be produced domestically. While the production of food increasingly shifted abroad, also the exports from Finland increased. >90% of the blue water of the Finnish crop supply came from foreignwater resources. Wemap the results of land and water use together with their impacts on global biodiversity, and show thatmost of the land and water use related biodiversity impacts (>93%) associated with the Finnish food consumption are related to the imports and therefore taken place outside the Finnish borders. The use ofmultiple environmental indicators can help identifying products and spatial hotspots associated with themost severe environmental impacts of the Finnish crop imports contributing to a more holistic decision-making and the promoting of sustainable food consumption both domestically and globally.

AB  - We present a model that considers the spatial aspects of biodiversity in urban planning. Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, is used as a study area. The model comprises three steps of strategic selection: (1) information sources; (2) target biotopes, and (3) presentation strategies adapted to priorities in spatial planning. A classification system based on the interpretation of colour infrared aerial photographs was developed. Established methods for the study of woodland and agricultural landscapes were merged and modified in order to fit the present objectives. Ecologically valuable biotopes were found both in green and built-up areas. The methods developed have been used in the comprehensive planning of Stockholm to designate the core areas and the zones in the surrounding landscape with different demands for spatial planning. The model to support urban planners with context-sensitive planning tools was sufficiently flexible for the adaptation to the conditions of each individual area and the level of detail suited to the planning situation. It also provided information on the effects of fragmentation, creating a platform for meaningful follow-up work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Long-term data from marked animals provide a wealth of opportunities for studies with high relevance to both basic ecological understanding and successful management in a changing world. The key strength of such data is that they allow us to quantify individual variation in vital rates (e.g. survival, growth, reproduction) and then link it mechanistically to dynamics at the population level. However, maintaining the collection of individual-based data over long time periods comes with large logistic efforts and costs and studies spanning over decades are therefore rare. This is the case particularly for migratory aquatic species, many of which are in decline despite their high ecological, cultural and economical value.
   New information
   This paper describes two unique publicly available time series of individual-based data originating from a 51-year mark-recapture study of a land-locked population of large-sized migratory brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway: the Hunder trout. In the period 1966-2015, nearly 14,000 adult Hunder trout have been captured and individually marked during their spawning migration from Lake Mjosa to the river Gubrandsdalslagen. Almost a third of those individuals were later recaptured alive during a later spawning run and/or captured by fishermen and reported dead or alive. This has resulted in the first data series: a markrecapture-recovery dataset spanning half a century and more than 18,000 capture records. The second data series consists of additional data on juvenile and adult growth and lifehistory schedules from half of the marked individuals, obtained by means of scale-sample analysis. The two datasets offer a rare long-term perspective on individuals and population dynamics and provide unique opportunities to gain insights into questions surrounding management, conservation and restoration of migratory salmonid populations and freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - A sediment sequence from a small forest lake in southwestern Sweden was investigated to explore the effects of forestry and land-use on catchment erosion and delivery of organic and minerogenic matter to the lake. Catchment-scale vegetation changes during the last 1,100 years were reconstructed quantitatively at 50-year resolution using pollen analysis and the Landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA). Variations in terrestrial organic matter input to lake sediments were assessed by total organic carbon (TOC) content and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios. Changes in minerogenic matter were analysed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning. The results show that Skogaryd was not intensively used for agriculture throughout the past 1,100 years, but its land-use changes were very sensitive to societal changes. Between ca. ad 950 and 1350, local land-use was characterized by small-scale agricultural activities associated with the Medieval expansion, and enhanced soil erosion was recorded by increased K, Ti and Rb deposition. Around ad 1350 much of the farmland was abandoned, most likely in response to outbreaks of plague. The abandonment of farmland caused increased coniferous woodland cover and lower soil erosion. From the 16th century land-use expanded and gradually intensified, concurrent with a population increase documented in the study area between ca. ad 1600 and 1850. Intensive exploitation of the forest led to soil erosion and increased terrestrial organic and minerogenic matter export to the lake. These processes peaked with the artificial drainage of a nearby wetland for agricultural purposes. During the 20th century, modern forestry management started with the plantation of conifers, and soil erosion declined.

AB  - Increasing mobility over the last 30 years has added to the population density in the south-eastern regions of Norway. This article focuses on the effects of the landscape changes that take place in the outskirts of towns and cities, with special focus on how pressure on land resources effects the preservation of cultural heritage. It is based on the project "Threatened landscapes - A study of the decision-making, legitimacy and practice of cultural heritage management in local planning,". The project aims at shedding light upon two main questions: What happens to the cultural and historical values in an area during a process of area development? To what extent has the cultural heritage management authorities succeeded in setting the terms for the developmental procedure? To tackle the first question, a mainly humanistic approach is appropriate, as it sets a need for knowing what sort of material structures from former times are embedded in the landscape. The second question highlights the impact of the planning procedure and its possibility to ensure that the cultural heritage is appropriately handled. The pressure on the fringe of the cities is caused by expansion of housing-estates as well as transport systems and it leads to a division and separation of integrated areas. The requirement - for cultural heritage work increases parallel with the growing fragmentation process. Despite the activities from several local idealists, the study shows that the cultural heritage work still primarily is taken care of on a formal basis - through the formal planning process in the hands of the regional responsible bodies. Particular attention is paid to handling the controlling perspective, but heritage work kept on this level represents a minimum-standard where the commitment brought in by enthusiasts to a large extent is missing [1].

AB  - The extent to which scientific knowledge translates into practice is a pervasive question. We analysed to what extent and how ecological scientists gave input to policy for two approaches advocated for promoting forest biodiversity in production forests in Sweden: green-tree retention (GTR) and continuous-cover forestry (CCF). GTR was introduced into forest policy in the 1970s and became widely implemented in the 1990s. Ecological scientists took part in the policy process by providing expert opinions, educational activities and as lobbyists, long before research confirming the positive effects of GTR on biodiversity was produced. In contrast, CCF was essentially banned in forest legislation in 1979. In the 1990s, policy implicitly opened up for CCF implementation, but CCF still remains largely a rare silvicultural outlier. Scientific publications addressing CCF appeared earlier than GTR studies, but with less focus on the effects on biodiversity. Ecological scientists promoted CCF in certain areas, but knowledge from other disciplines and other socio-political factors appear to have been more important than ecological arguments in the case of CCF. The wide uptake of GTR was enhanced by its consistency with the silvicultural knowledge and normative values that forest managers had adopted for almost a century, whereas CCF challenged those ideas. Public pressure and institutional requirements were also key to GTR implementation but were not in place for CCF. Thus, scientific ecological knowledge may play an important role for policy uptake and development, but knowledge from other research disciplines and socio-political factors are also important.

AB  - Long-term data from a network of intensively monitored research catchments in Finland was analysed. We studied temporal (1981-2010) and spatial variability in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), from 1987 losses, both from agricultural and forestry land. Based on trend analysis, total nitrogen (TN) concentrations increased in two of the four agricultural sites and in most of the forested sites. In agricultural catchments, the total phosphorus (TP) trends were decreasing in two of the four catchments studied. Dissolved P (DRP) concentrations increased in two catchments and decreased in one. The increase in DRP concentration can be a result of reducing erosion by increased non-plough cultivation and direct sowing. In forested catchments, the TP trends in 1987-2011 were significantly decreasing in three of the six catchments, while DRP concentrations decreased significantly in all sites. At the same time, P fertilisation in Finnish forests has decreased significantly, thus contributing to these changes. The mean annual specific loss for agricultural land was on average 15.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for N and 1.1 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for P. In the national scale, total TN loading from agriculture varied between 34,000-37,000 t year(-1) and total P loading 2400-2700 t year(-1) These new load estimates are of the same order than those reported earlier, emphasising the need for more efforts with wide-ranging and carefully targeted implementation of water protection measures.

AB  - Having clear ecological knowledge of protected species is essential for being able to successfully take actions towards conservation, but this knowledge is also crucial for managing and preventing conservation conflicts. For example, the Siberian flying squirrel, Pteromys volans, listed in the EU Habitats Directive and inhabiting mature forests that are also the target for logging, has had a major role in political discussions regarding conservation in Finland. This species has also been well-researched during recent decades, providing knowledge on the ecology and management of the animal. Herein, we review knowledge on habitats, demography, community interactions and spatial ecology of this flagship species. We compare the ecology of flying squirrels with that of other arboreal squirrels, and summarize conservation management and policy related to flying squirrels. Reviewed research on the Siberian flying squirrel shows that the species has many similarities in behaviour to other arboreal squirrels. For instance, arboreal squirrels deviate from the general pattern of male-biased sexual size dimorphism in mammals, which perhaps relates to the mating system of arboreal squirrels. Important differences are found in the response of Siberian flying squirrels to tree mast, i.e. pulsed food resource, compared to that of red squirrels, and in communal nesting behaviour compared to that of North American flying squirrels. The extensive knowledge on dispersal behaviour of the flying squirrel, well-studied habitat associations and the proved need for evidence-based conservation may guide researchers and managers working with other similar species. For conservation, the case of the Siberian flying squirrel demonstrates that habitat protection becomes both ineffective and uneconomical if ecological knowledge is not applied in the conservation planning process. The cost-effective conservation of the species requires both landscape-level conservation planning and flexible conservation options to increase the motivation of land owners for conservation.

AB  - In keeping with international efforts to encourage sustainable forest management, new legislation, regulations. and certification criteria have been brought into effect across boreal regions of the world in the past decade or less. These initiatives have established hierarchical systems of forest management planning that consider multiple uses of the forest and various aspects of sustainable forest management at different scales. We describe the systems established in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, Russia, Finland, and Sweden. Most jurisdictions employ some form of three-level planning framework. in which strategic, tactical, and operational plans and considerations are presented with successively greater detail and spatial explicitness, However. planning scales and time horizons vary considerably, as does the level of consideration given to biodiversity and social concerns. We examine these systems in the context of sustainable forest management, raising a number of questions to be addressed in future research, adaptive management, and policy reform. In particular, we note (1) a need of new landscape and regional planning tools to evaluate the long-term and large-scale impacts of various land uses and (2) a general lack of responsiveness to global carbon and climate change concerns.

AB  - The forest ecosystems in northern Europe have undergone extensive changes over the last 200 years. We present the first detailed account on how modern forest management has transformed a beech (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forest landscape in southern Sweden. Specifically, we analyse changes in forest distribution, composition and structure since 1840 at Skabersjo estate and discuss the implications for forest biodiversity. Skabersjo estate is a representative example for the development of semi-open wood pastures into managed dense forests for timber production. This development was part of a long-term process during which changing socio-economic conditions initiated a pervasive change of the Swedish forest landscape, including increasing total forest areas and timber stocks but decreasing relative shares of broadleaved trees. The successful transition to net reforestation starting in the mid-nineteenth century benefitted from a new scientific approach to forest management and the banning of forest grazing. At Skabersjo estate, the introduction of organised forestry resulted in steadily increasing timber yields, but the associated changes in forest structure and composition also changed habitat conditions for many species associated to temperate broadleaved trees. A strong decline of old beech trees has resulted in a lower habitat availability for specialised epiphytic and saproxylic species.

AB  - Transport is strongly linked to cities and affected by planning related to their future. Trends such as population growth and aging, liveable cities, infrastructure resilience, and changes in land use patterns are reshaping how people and goods move across urban areas. In Norway, local authorities are primarily responsible for facilitating these trends by incorporating related issues into their planning processes. In contrast to personal travel, freight transport and logistics have been neglected by local authorities in urban planning. Thus, in order to address freight transport in decision-making processes, local authorities need to have an increased understanding of urban freight and to pay more attention to freight transport and city logistics. The aim of the paper is to understand the potential for coordinated logistics planning at the local level. Interviews were held with representatives of public authorities and private stakeholders within the logistics supply chain in three Norwegian cities. It is necessary for local authorities to understand stakeholders' operations, perspectives, and attitudes in order to ensure that their involvement in urban planning will be constructive. The findings show that there are no overall strategies for urban freight or city logistics in the studied cities, although public authorities are concerned with issues related to urbanisation and sustainability that indirectly affect freight deliveries. Furthermore, there is poor capacity in planning and policymaking regarding freight. Local authorities comprise a number of fragmented departments and appear to lack resources dedicated to urban freight. However, such authorities realise the need for their contribution in the process of establishing urban logistics plans.

AB  - Iron production was historically associated with major impacts on forests worldwide, as vast amounts of wood were harvested to produce the charcoal needed for heating the furnaces and reducing iron oxides in the ore to iron. This impact has left abundant legacies which potentially may remain in the present-day vegetation. We investigated how remains of historic charcoal production, mainly from the 18th to the early 20th century, at still remaining charcoal kiln platforms (CKPs), affect the current species richness, species occurrences and cover of vascular plants in the ground vegetation in a Swedish mining district located in the boreo-nemoral forest zone. CKPs have a significantly higher species richness than the surrounding forest, and they also affect cover (negatively) for ericaceous species typically dominating the forest ground vegetation. Several forest species are more frequent at CKPs, and these also harbor significantly more uncommon species, of which many are typical for traditionally managed grasslands. These latter species are likely to represent remnants in present-day forests reflecting former land-use such as livestock grazing. The soil chemistry at CKPs is strongly deviating from the surrounding forest, and this, together with a lower cover of ericaceous shrubs, are the most likely mechanisms behind the higher species richness. CKPs represent conspicuous and abundant historic anthropogenic habitats in the forest vegetation. As far as we are aware, the flora at CKPs in boreal and boreo-nemoral forests has not previously been investigated in detail, and they deserve more attention, both from a biological and a cultural-historical perspective.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyse the Constructive Dialogue, an initiative for collaborative and integrated urban governance for a sustainable built environment. The dialogue processes, implemented in six Swedish cities in 2004-2009, involved various actors and many types of initiative. Designed as a meta-analysis based on existing evaluations and supplementary interviews, this study examines experiences in capacity building in terms of building relationships, enhancing knowledge, and mobilisation. The study also considers achieved outcome in terms of sustainability, and specifically in terms of environmental aspects. The results show that the collaborative processes to promote relationship building were highly appreciated and that processes of knowledge exchange and knowledge enhancement were seen as quite successful. Consequently, an important result was the enabling of faster processes for urban planning to facilitate the process of urban densification. However, capacity building in terms of mobilisation for a sustainable development was seen to be less successful; the results show that the capacity of the Dialogue to enable mobilisation around sustainability issues through the creation of common visions and goals was weak. The best result was seen in Malmo where the Constructive Dialogue resulted in a shared sustainability agreement which was applied in the development of a new construction site. However, limitations were the difficulties in setting ambitious goals and the lack of knowledge and experience to meet the goals set in the agreement. The study indicates a difficulty in simultaneously considering process and environmental concerns and a tension between consensus and cutting-edge solutions. The study also illustrates the need to further develop processes for urban governance for sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Fennoscandinan forestry, retention of forest strips as a buffer adjacent to water and bogs has long been recommended, but their biological value is poorly known and practice varies greatly. This study explored the value for breeding birds of retaining buffer strips of different width and structure, after clear-cutting in coniferous forest. The presence of birds during their nesting season was inventoried in 370 strips in south-eastern Norway. The species number per 100 m strip length increased with increasing strip width up to about 30 m width, and then remained constant up to 70 - 100 m width. Generalist species dominated all width categories. Important habitat factors other than strip width were basal area of spruce, short visibility and tree height. Although 11 - 20 m wide strips had the highest density of species and individuals per hectare, buffer strips of about 30 m width may be recommended, as narrower strips had fewer species per unit length of edge.

AB  - Norway is considering a national afforestation program for greenhouse gas sequestration on recently abandoned semi-natural pastureland. However, the program may have negative impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity. We conducted a nation-wide choice experiment survey to estimate non-market values, combined with secondary data on program costs and other impacts, to derive the social net return on land use scenarios. Our results indicate that the scenarios where either half of the abandoned pastures are recovered, or half of the pastures are recovered, and a quarter are designated to the climate forest program, yields the highest net present value. The net present value of all land use scenarios remains positive when limiting the aggregation of willingness to pay to rural households, and when allowing for potential hypothetical bias in benefit estimates and cost increases. Results indicate that landscape and biodiversity values are substantial and should be considered when designing agricultural and climate policies.

AB  - Blue economy developments entail an industrialization of the world's ocean and coastal areas, placing growing pressures on the marine environment and ecosystems. Moreover, the competition for ocean space and resources increases the likelihood for social conflicts. Marine spatial planning has been presented as a tool that can avoid or mitigate conflicts. However, there is a need for a more thorough analysis of the conflicts linked to the blue economy. The objective of this paper is to analyze characteristics of blue economy conflicts and how they are shaped by the institutional context and sustainability discourses. This study also explores perspectives on conflict management and pathways toward sustainable transformations in marine planning. Empirically, we use two case studies of blue growth industries in Norway: (1) offshore wind energy development and (2) offshore aquaculture development. Through these cases, we take a close look at the established principles and procedures which regulate conflicts. Our study shows how current blue economy conflicts are framed and handled through institutionalized practices of conflict management. Our findings are twofold. First, blue economy conflicts are not easily categorized through common conflict typologies (i.e., user-user, user-environment) but increasingly appear to be sustainability conflicts in which all actors use sustainability as a frame of reference for discussing possible and desirable futures. Second, conflicts are not necessarily a negative social process. In fact, conflicts often uncover unsustainable practices and create potential positive pathways for sustainable transformations.

AB  - Some researchers have claimed that cultural heritage can best be understood as 'the contemporary use of the past' (Graham et al., 2000). While parts of heritage may be material remains of a long forgotten past, the way these fragments are viewed, interpreted and appreciated as social and cultural assets is a product of today. The basis of this paper is a study of the role that old cemeteries play as green public spaces in contemporary cities. The layout of the cemeteries and their locations within cities influences their everyday use. By comparing three urban cemeteries, one in Oslo (Norway), one in Sheffield (United Kingdom) and one in Kaliningrad (Russia), this article will reflect on how these city's histories have influenced the form and layout of the cemeteries, as well as their potential roles as future green areas in a modern urban context. At present, one of the cemeteries is in active use, one is a secluded public garden, and the third is on the verge of obliteration. Their common denominator is the character they share as memory sites. They can be read as a complex conflation of religious and moral belief, societal power and hierarchy, landscape and architectural ideals, health legislation and management practices. Their prospects as historic assets valued in future urban development are dependent both on planning contexts and strong cooperation with those who care about their future.

AB  - Finland, Norway and Sweden are characterized by small privately owned forest holdings, averaging only 60 hectares. The forests were over-exploited during the decades around the turn of the last century. Poor regeneration brought the prevalent partial cutting systems into discredit.
   After the Second World War, the call for move efficiency and the development of new technology simplified forest operations. Clearcutting dominated, particularly on the larger estates. The regeneration of spruce, Picea abies, was often established by planting; while pine, Pinus sylvestris, was regenerated by natural seeding with seed frees.
   The forest acts in the three countries in this period were focused on wood production. Today, revised forestry acts and regulations emphasize multiple use forestry and biodiversity. A larger variety of silvicultural systems, from clearcutting to selection cutting, will probably be practical in the future. Among forest owners and professionals on all levels there exists an increasing interest in ecologically-based silvicultural systems. Several research projects are now focused on multiple use forestry, biodiversity and silvicultural adaptation within sustainable utilization of the renewable resources.

AB  - Coastal environments have experienced large ecological changes as a result of human activities over the last 100-200 years. To understand the severity and potential consequences of such changes, paleoenvironmental records provide important contextual information. The Baltic Sea coastal zone is naturally a vulnerable system and subject to significant human-induced impacts. To put the recent environmental degradation in the Baltic coastal zone into a long-term perspective, and to assess the natural and anthropogenic drivers of environmental change, we present sedimentary records covering the last 1000 years obtained from a coastal inlet (Gasfjarden) and a nearby lake (Lake Storsjon) in Sweden. We investigate the links between a pollen-based land cover reconstruction from Lake Storsjon and paleoenvironmental variables from Gasfjarden itself, including diatom assemblages, organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, stable C and N isotopic ratios, and biogenic silica contents. The Lake Storsjon record shows that regional land use was characterized by small-scale agricultural activity between 900 and 1400 CE, which slightly intensified between 1400 and 1800 CE. Substantial expansion of cropland was observed between 1800 and 1950 CE, before afforestation between 1950 and 2010 CE. From the Gasfjarden record, prior to 1800 CE, relatively minor changes in the diatom and geochemical proxies were found. The onset of cultural eutrophication in Gasfjarden can be traced to the 1800s and intensified land use is identified as the main driver. Anthropogenic activities in the 20th century have caused unprecedented ecosystem changes in the coastal inlet, as reflected in the diatom composition and geochemical proxies. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article examines elements of the social sustainability of hunting tourism development by scrutinising Finnish hunters' opinions on three possible scenarios related to hunting tourism: the threat of an exclusion of local hunters, the threat of rising rents of hunting land and the threat to Finnish hunting customs and practice due to increasing numbers of foreign hunting tourists. Hunters' positions on these three issues are mapped and the determinants of their attitudes are analysed using unique national survey data on Finnish hunters and their attitudes (N= 1193). The results show a clear ambivalence to hunting tourism among hunters. While a majority of hunters tend to view hunting tourism as a threat, a large minority relate to it more positively. These attitudinal patterns can be explained only partly by socioeconomic factors, whereas factors pertaining to hunting experience and hunting profile play a somewhat more prominent role in understanding the legitimacy that hunting tourism enjoys in the eyes of hunters in Finland. Age, rural residence and participation in wildlife management are also found important for some issues. The ambiguities revealed could pose major problems for social sustainability and hunting tourism management and development.

AB  - Many freshwater ecosystems face severe threats from anthropogenic disturbances, yet little is known about the degree to which their. biotic communities have been degraded by human activities. We analysed temporal changes and persistence of bryophyte communities in 40 springs in eastern Finland by comparing field surveys conducted in 1986 and 2000. During that period, some springs had remained in a near-pristine state, while others had undergone varying degrees of disturbance from forest management, drainage, and water abstraction. Several spring bryophytes (e.g., Philonotis fontana) declined between the study years, whereas Sphagnum mosses (e.g., Sphagnum warnstorfii) increased in abundance. Species richness of spring bryophytes declined significantly from 1986 to 2000, irrespective of bryophyte group (spring vs. other bryophytes) and spring condition (severely disturbed vs. unaltered springs). Bryophyte cover also decreased dramatically from 1986 to 2000, but this effect was related to both spring condition and bryophyte type. Spring bryophytes lost much of their cover in severely altered springs, while in unaltered springs they remained relatively stable through time. No such trend was observed for other, habitat generalist bryophytes. Persistence and stability of bryophyte communities showed significant, albeit rather weak, relationships with spring condition, with communities in unaltered springs being more persistent than those in altered springs. Given the importance of springs to boreal forest and aquatic biodiversity, restoration of degraded springs is a major challenge to maintaining and conserving biodiversity of boreal landscapes.

AB  - Hunting tourism can help to diversify local economies in rural areas. In northern Sweden, hunting tourism has the potential to counteract outmigration and unemployment, but may entail ecological and social risks. I used a mail survey of 2,110 hunters in rural northern Sweden to assess attitudes toward hunting tourism. Respondents emphasized the importance of hunting to maintain economical, social, and cultural values in the rural areas. Most hunters estimated that game contributed equal or larger amount of meat to their household than meat bought commercially. Few respondents had first hand experience of hunting tourism and they were divided on their attitude towards promoting hunting tourism. Many (46%) were uncertain about their attitude towards hunting tourism; 36% were positive and 18% were negative. Ethical values on using wildlife in hunting tourism and the attitude towards new hunters coming to hunt influenced attitudes on development of hunting tourism. Hunters that were positive to hunting tourism believed that it would create new jobs. Because hunting in Sweden is highly organized and collective, there are no models of hunting tourism adapted to the hunting culture in northern Sweden. The uncertainty of the potential local benefits from a development of hunting tourism should be placed within a research framework, especially in the northernmost parts where governmental undertakings are large and the state can influence land use.

AB  - The energy transitions are in an acceleration phase, where less carbon intensive technologies emerge, but their applicability is uncertain creating a need for real-life experimentation. Cities have become a focal context, where novel constellations of technologies and practices are introduced to reconfigure patterns of production and consumption. One area of urban energy governance gaining increasing attention especially in a Northern context is the low carbon transition in district heating systems that provide the majority of heating in the residential sector and has been primarily built around combustion technologies relying on fossil energy reserves. This article analyses a bidirectional low heat experiment in district heat in Finland by examining what are the dimensions of institutional inertia and how it impacts the reconfiguration of an urban energy system. Institutional inertia emerges from the technical innovation itself, land-use planning practices, the absence of formal regulations and via organisational inertia in the implementation of the experiment. We find that visions about the innovation can become constraints of the experiment, which limit learning and reshaping of innovation, thus preventing radical transformation of the district heating system and watering down the initial target of the experiment. We contribute to the conceptualisation of institutional inertia within the energy transition.

AB  - This study investigates the consequences of dramatic price fluctuations on the global iron ore market between boom and bust for the Swedish communities Kiruna and Pajala, located above the polar circle, in the years 2006-2018. It focuses on the impact of the Swedish state's reorientation towards neoliberal policies that have entailed reduced state involvement in peripheral communities still dependant on heavy industry. This reorientation was manifested in the Mineral Strategy presented by the liberal-conservative government in 2013, in which the state was prescribed a role as facilitator of investment of foreign and private capital in the Swedish mining sector, but not as an active owner or developer of mining enterprises. The neoliberalisation of Swedish mining has established a fundamental conflict of interests between communities whose economic, social and cultural wellbeing depends on long-term state commitment, and the state whose main interests are aimed at global capital flows rather than the maintenance of industrial production in peripheral regions. This conflict remained latent as long as global mineral prices were high, but as boom turned to bust around 2012, it was activated in a way that highlighted asymmetric relations of power and economic development between the sparsely populated and resource-rich northern parts of the country and the densely populated south.

AB  - The Nordic and Baltic countries are in the frontline of replacing fossil fuel with renewables. An important question is how forest management of the productive parts of this region can support a sustainable development of our societies in reaching low or carbon neutral conditions by 2050. This may involve a 70% increased consumption of biomass and waste to meet the goals. The present review concludes that a 50-100% increase of forest growth at the stand scale, relative to today's common level of forest productivity, is a realistic estimate within a stand rotation (similar to 70 years). Change of tree species, including the use of non-native species, tree breeding, introduction of high-productive systems with the opportunity to use nurse crops, fertilization and afforestation are powerful elements in an implementation and utilization of the potential. The productive forests of the Nordic and Baltic countries cover in total 63 million hectares, which corresponds to an average 51% land cover. The annual growth is 287 million m(3) and the annual average harvest is 189 million m3 ( 65% of the growth). A short-term increase of wood-based bioenergy by utilizing more of the growth is estimated to be between 236 and 416 TWh depending on legislative and operational restrictions. Balanced priorities of forest functions and management aims such as nature conservation, biodiversity, recreation, game management, ground water protection etc. all need consideration. We believe that these aims may be combined at the landscape level in ways that do not conflict with the goals of reaching higher forest productivity and biomass production.

TI  - Agriculture as an upholder of cultural heritage? Conceptualizations and value judgements - A Norwegian perspective in international context
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The multifunctional role of agriculture as a producer of collective goods in addition to food and fibre, has been stressed within the context of negotiations on the liberalization of the world market for food (WTO) and in general in discussions concerning restructuring of the agricultural sector. One of these collective goods, cultural heritage, is connected to agricultural practice and covers objects, sites and areas influenced by agricultural activity, as well as experience based knowledge of work, resource utilization and management. Agriculture is seen both as a threat to and a caretaker of cultural heritage. This double role is recognized in Norway, although the responsibility of the agricultural sector as a caretaker of cultural heritage is stressed. This article investigates the connection between agriculture and cultural heritage as expressed by public and private actors who define the policy agenda, namely the cultural heritage or environmental, the agricultural and tourism sectors. This is done by analysing explicit and implicit value judgements in central concepts like "cultural heritage", "active agriculture" and "added value". The Norwegian case is compared to the international context. The analysis shows that within a Nordic context active farming and cultural heritage is positively linked and the farmer is seen as a major caretaker, while in documents from dominant international actors cultural heritage is seen as something on the side of active farming. Although differences reflect some actual variation in the consequences of agricultural practices, it is clear that concepts serve as 'legitimizing tools' placing central actors within a specific political agenda.

AB  - The Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) is an arboreal rodent that inhabits spruce-dominated boreal forest. The species has declined in Finland, probably due to modem forestry. We studied genetic variation in the flying squirrel (n = 159) between eight sampling sites in Finland using seven microsatellite loci. Heterozygosity levels were similar in the flying squirrel as found for other Sciurid species. There were slight heterozygote excesses over all loci. Isolation by distance was clear and genetic differentiation between sampling sites was high (overall F-ST = 0.115). In addition, geographical isolation of one site was observed as increased differentiation and low allele richness. Radio telemetry studies have revealed that the dispersal abilities of flying squirrels are good. However, the high differentiation between sampling sites indicates that the actual gene flow over large distances is low. Thus our results emphasize the importance of landscape-level management in the conservation of the flying squirrel.

AB  - The forest transition describes a reversal or turnaround in long-run land-use trends for a country or region from a period of net forest area loss to net gain. Such forest recovery has occurred in high-income economies, and increasingly in developing countries. Although this process has been studied extensively by geographers, social scientists and historians, only recently has it been analyzed by economists. This contribution has focused on how competing land use values result in changing patterns of use that lead to an increase or decrease in forest cover. A simple model of forest transition is developed to illustrate this approach in the literature. Empirical applications attempt to explain the underlying economic factors, including governance and institutions, which determine the long-run transition in land use values and patterns. The various findings of these analyses have important policy implications, including for REDD + and other forest recovery programs.

AB  - The genetic diversity within and among 17 populations of Carex loliacea from Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Poland and southcentral Alaska was evaluated by isozyme analysis. An extremely low allozyme variation was found. Fourteen populations were monomorphic at all 18 isozymes. Only three Estonian populations studied showed limited variation of one isozyme, malate dehydrogenase MDH-A, with two allozymes. Almost all allozyme variation was observed as homozygous variants. Of 400 individuals analyzed, only six revealed heterozygous morphs. The high level of inbreeding (F = 0.91) clearly shows that C. loliacea is a predominantly selfing species. The variation of MDH-A showed some geographic distribution. Finnish, Swedish and Alaskan populations form one group, and Polish and Estonian populations form another. The pattern of intraspecific geographic differentiation may reflect the postglacial recolonization routes.

AB  - Everyday traffic accounts for a significant share of overall greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2). While several solutions have been proposed for decreasing the emissions, a new kind of land use planning is required in order to achieve long-term effects. This study focuses on the effect of large retail store locations in the urban structure on overall CO2 emissions, by using the Oulu region, Finland, as a case study. The aim was to utilize GIS tools to assess store locations in terms of CO2 emissions from private cars used for consumer traffic. In this case, not only are the locations of the existing and planned retail units investigated with respect to population distribution and car ownership, but the analysis is also carried out by regarding any location within the study area as a hypothetical site for a large retail unit. According to the applied method, CO2 values are lowest near the centre of the studied region, the region with the highest population density, although the city centre itself did not turn out to be the most optimal location for a retail store in terms of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, by generally reducing trip length, a compact urban structure is an important way of achieving long-term cuts in CO2 emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For many years, the planning and management of terrestrial areas has been supported by a detailed knowledge of the distribution of habitats and their associated species. However, the detailed mapping of biological resources in extent coastal areas, such as the Norwegian coastal zone, is unrealistic due to its enormous coastline. Here, we present a useful and feasible approach and a set of simple, cost-effective methods which are suitable for providing a broad-scale overview of marine habitats and fish resources. This approach was developed in conjunction with a pioneer study conducted along the southern coast of the Skagerrak, where we combined knowledge gathered from local fishermen with scientific knowledge of important species and nature types to establish a coastal sea mapping program. GIS modeling tools were used in both the mapping program and to integrate local and scientific knowledge into digital maps made available to local area management. This multi-faceted approach, which combines local knowledge and scientific methods, provides valuable information with respect to marine biodiversity, and has been used extensively by local environmental management.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation may affect species distributions through, for example, altered resource availability and shifts in species interactions. Fragmentation by roads has had negative impacts on Fennoscandian alpine ecosystems, with reduction of habitats and connectivity for alpine species. Concurrently, infrastructure development causes influx of subsidies through roadkills and litter, which may facilitate expansion of boreal scavenging species, such as the red foxVulpes vulpes, which may intensify negative interactions with alpine species. Hence, understanding the impact of subsidies within marginal alpine areas is imperative for successful conservation and management of particularly vulnerable alpine species. We used snow tracking and camera traps in three alpine tundra areas in Norway to investigate whether the presence of boreal scavengers was positively associated with highways during winter, and if this contrasted the pattern of a critically endangered alpine species, the Arctic foxVulpes lagopus. In summer, artificial nests were used to assess whether predation risk was related to proximity to highways. During winter, the occurrence of red foxes was higher close to highways and decreased with increasing distance to highways, while the arctic fox showed no discernible pattern. Red fox occurrence increased with the number of edible items of anthropogenic origin located along highways, whereas arctic fox occurrence decreased. The overall predation risk of artificial nests during summer was high (>31.2%) and increased with proximity to the highway in the area with highest traffic volume. Synthesis and applications. Highways crossing alpine areas may attract boreal scavengers, possibly connected to increased access to subsidies of anthropogenic origin. Litter and food waste dominated available subsidies along highways in our study, and prevailing mitigating measures directed at reducing roadkill and movement restrictions may not be applicable to reduce negative effects of littering. We recommend actions focusing on informational campaigns, improved garbage disposal facilities and routines, and imposing fines for littering, to reduce negative impacts on vulnerable species. This is likely needed to achieve goals of 'no impact' from the physical loss of habitats due to road development.

AB  - Boreal forest nations are often thought to have similar environmental, social, and economic contexts. In this communication we show that boreal forest nations are a disparate grouping, with some similarities and many differences. Highlighting these differing national contexts provides insights into how a given nation utilizes the boreal forests over which it holds stewardship responsibilities. Current national contexts are related to each nation's physiography, climate, history, legacy of past forest management, the timing of transition from natural to plantation forests, population density and distribution, and access to resources and markets. Boreal forests are dominated by pioneer species that are resilient to disturbance and have a demonstrated ability to adapt to past climate changes. National responses to natural disturbances are linked to forest area, ownership, and management intensity. Boreal forests in large nations (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation) are typically publicly owned, and disturbances such as fire are allowed to progress naturally over remote areas. In smaller nations, where there is often a greater proportion of private ownership and a focus on production forestry, natural disturbances are more aggressively controlled (e.g., Sweden, Finland). Large nations with low boreal human population densities have a greater proportion of natural boreal forest, with relatively higher levels of biodiversity when compared to the fully managed forests of some smaller boreal nations. In smaller nations, the combination of limited forest area and private ownership has facilitated the dominance of intensive sustainable forestry management practices (e.g., Finland). Conversely, in nations with more spatially extensive forest assets that are publicly owned and managed to meet multiple objectives, extensive sustainable forest management practices dominate (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation).

AB  - The most radical anthropogenic impact on water systems in Sweden originates from the years 1900-1970, when the electricity network was developed in the country and almost all rivers were regulated. The construction of dams and changes in water flow caused problems for ecosystems. Therefore, when implementing the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) hydro-morphological indicators and targets were developed for rivers and lakes to achieve good ecological potential. The hydrological regime is one such indicator. To understand the change in flow regime we quantified the hydropower impact on river flow across Sweden by using the S-HYPE model and observations. The results show that the average redistribution of water during a year due to regulation is 19% for the total discharge from Sweden. A distinct impact was found in seasonal flow patterns and flow duration curves. Moreover, we quantified the model skills in predicting hydropower impact on flow. The median NSE for simulating change in flow regime was 0.71 for eight dams studied. Results from the spatially distributed model are available for 37 000 sub-basins across the country, and will be used by the Swedish water authorities for reporting hydro-morphological indicators to the EU and for guiding the allocation of river restoration measures.

AB  - A primary impediment in achieving sustainable mobility objectives is the multi-level and cross-sectoral nature of land-use and transport planning. This paper investigates whether changes in structural conditions have affected the ability of Norwegian regional authorities to succeed in sustainable mobility planning. The effects of the changes were minor, as the national government acted in ways that undermined the power of regional authorities. By analysing the fine-grained inter-agency dynamics, this study contributes richer and more nuanced theoretical understandings of the challenges involved in sustainable transport planning. The new insights could assist discussions in many countries on how land-use and transport planning can be organized to facilitate more sustainable mobility patterns.

AB  - Due to increased urbanisation, and climate change, there have been calls for a more sustainable management of stormwater. Blue-green measures have been recognised as a sustainable solution and a necessary complement to pipe-bound approaches. The aim of this study is to identify barriers and drivers in the implementation of blue-green measures in a Swedish context, to increase the understanding of how they could be implemented in a more successful manner. The study is qualitative and based on semi-structured interviews. Through the lens of transition theory, barriers and drivers for blue-green measures were identified and they give an updated picture of Swedish urban stormwater management. Many factors encourage municipal actors to implement blue-green solutions, such as increased need for recreation, protection of biodiversity and climate change. Identified barriers are found within the municipal stormwater management it-self, but can also be found outside the storm water management structure, such as lack of knowledge among politicians, officials, exploiters and civilians, fragmented roles and responsibilities in general, as well as uncertainty of the effects and cost of new alternatives. The study has three main findings; Several barriers were mentioned by most of the interviewees clearly show that a wide range of changes are needed to alter the current stormwater management regime; Niche innovations are often put forward as a way to enhance socio-technical transition, but this study is that such an approach is oversimplified instead elaborated suggestions for an alteration of urban stormwater management is given, both with top-down and bottom-up perspective. For the success of blue-green solutions, educational efforts are important at different levels in the planning, building and maintenance process of blue-green solutions. Therefore, employees must have a good general knowledge of both blue and green issues as well as having contacts in the different sectors of the municipality. To conclude we argue that a transition can not only be induced by pilot projects but requires change in legal structures as well as altered financing models for blue-green solutions. Moreover, the ongoing, but slow, change should therefor probably be interpreted as a shift to a new regime, but rather an evolutionary transition where new approaches are combined with traditional, pipe-bound solutions.

AB  - Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactyius) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution.
   Very few examples exist of WbfE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability; represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

AB  - Modern forestry has created stands with even age distribution of trees and fragmentation of the habitat. In boreal forests, the effects on biodiversity within many taxa need to be examined. We tested the hypothesis that species richness of foliose and fruticose lichens and spiders is positively related in the lower canopy of spruce (Picea abies) in forests with, or without, management in central Sweden. High species richness of lichens may increase the structural complexity of the microhabitat on spruce branches, and bring a higher species richness also in the spider community. In six areas, spruce branches were sampled in old-growth and managed boreal forest stands, respectively. Forest management did not affect the species richness of spiders or lichens, but an effect due to sampling area was found in the latter taxon. There was a significant covariation between species richness of lichens and spiders, and the hypothesised positive correlation was confirmed by separate analyses for each area and combining the probabilities. Moreover, regression analysis on mean values from each site revealed a positive relationship. We conclude that species richness of lichens and spiders covary on spruce branches for functional reasons, i.e. more lichen species promotes a more diverse spider community by increasing the structural heterogeneity. Our results might provide a 'shortcut' for assessing biodiversity in boreal forests.

AB  - This article is devoted to an important element of the Russian autocracy's policy in the ethno-confessional area - the accession of the Grand Duchy of Finland and the establishment of its autonomous governance in Russia. Since the pre-revolutionary period, Russian historiography has tended to attribute a liberal attitude to Finland to the peculiarities of the socio-political views of emperor Alexander I, who allegedly planned to extend the constitutional order to the whole country at a certain period of his reign. Unlike Russian historians, Western experts interpret the development of the Finnish course of tsarism as a result of the prevailing international situation at that time. The authors of this study have attempted to analyze this problem from the second point of view. They conclude that the grant of Finland's considerable share of political independence stemmed from the imperial government's desire to stabilize the situation on the North-Western borders as much as possible in anticipation of a large-scale conflict with Napoleonic France. In the future, the influence of the external factor on the actions of the authorities in the region remained, although it changed its content-from the alliance with Sweden to the fear of the revolutionary threat from the West and the struggle against the European press.

AB  - Although invasive alien species have been identified as the second greatest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss, characterizing and quantifying their impacts on native species and habitats remains a fundamental problem in conservation biology. Here, I review the techniques that are currently used to assess the impact of invasive alien species on biodiversity, highlighting both their uses in invasive species ecology and their limitations in establishing a causal relationship. Adopting a hypothesis-driven experimental approach to impact assessment, and to eradication efforts through adaptive management, would benefit our ecological understanding of invasive species without delaying critical management action that could reduce the spread of invasive species populations.

AB  - Genetic diversity is one of several factors affecting extinction risk in vulnerable populations. In addition to informing conservation management strategies, data on genetic variability can also shed light on the recency and magnitude of historic bottlenecks. The pine hoverfly Blera fallax is one of the rarest invertebrates in the UK, known from just two sites in Scotland. It belongs to an often overlooked, species-rich community that is fundamental to forest function, the saproxylics (that depend on dead wood). To assist current conservation management for B. fallax, including captive breeding and translocations, it is important to know whether genetic factors will limit the success of recovery. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we compared the genetic variation in Scottish and Swedish specimens (Swedish populations are thought to represent a more outbred B. fallax population). As expected, the Scottish population showed significantly lower levels of polymorphism, expected heterozygosity and allelic richness than the Swedish population. Furthermore, significant genetic differentiation was found between the two B. fallax populations (F-ST = 0.134). We then used an allele frequency-based approach and a Bayesian coalescent-based method to assess genealogical history and detect recent changes in population size. Unexpectedly, data from not only the Scottish but also the Swedish population indicated a strong and relatively recent decline that was more pronounced in Scotland. We discuss the implications of our findings for future conservation management planning, the first undertaking of its kind for saproxylic species in Britain.

AB  - Transitioning to fossil-free transport and reducing car use are necessary to meet European and national climate goals. Cities are promising leverage points to facilitate system transitions by promoting local innovation and policy experimentation. Building on transition management, we developed a knowledge base for the imple-mentation of transition experiments to reduce city-level car use. From screening nearly 800 peer-reviewed studies and case studies, including in-depth analysis of 24 documents that met quality criteria and quantita-tively estimated car use reduction, we identify 12 intervention types combining different measures and policy instruments that were effective in reducing car use in European cities. The most effective at reducing overall car use were the Congestion Charge, Parking & Traffic Congrol, and Limited Traffic Zone. Most interventions were led by local government, planned and decided in collaboration with different urban stakeholders. We evaluated the potential of the identified intervention types to be implemented in a pilot study of Lund, Sweden, using three criteria from Transition Management of novelty, feasibility, and suitability, as assessed by interviews with local experts. We recommend three transition experiments to reduce local car use in Lund: Parking and Traffic Control, Workplace Parking Charge, and Mobility Services for Commuters. We suggest practitioners follow our method to identify effective and locally suitable interventions to reduce car use, and future research quantify the effec-tiveness of interventions to reduce car use using the standardised outcome measure of daily passenger kilometres travelled by car.

AB  - Over the past centuries, humans have transformed large parts of the biosphere, and there is a growing need to understand and predict the distribution of biodiversity hotspots influenced by the presence of humans. Our basic hypothesis is that human influence in the Anthropocene is ubiquitous, and we predict that biodiversity hot spot modeling can be improved by addressing three challenges raised by the increasing ecological influence of humans: (i) anthropogenically modified responses to individual ecological factors, (ii) fundamentally different processes and predictors in landscape types shaped by different land use histories and (iii) a multitude and complexity of natural and anthropogenic processes that may require many predictors and even multiple models in different landscape types. We modeled the occurrence of veteran oaks in Norway, and found, in accordance with our basic hypothesis and predictions, that humans influence the distribution of veteran oaks throughout its range, but in different ways in forests and open landscapes. In forests, geographical and topographic variables related to the oak niche are still important, but the occurrence of veteran oaks is shifted toward steeper slopes, where logging is difficult. In open landscapes, land cover variables are more important, and veteran oaks are more common toward the north than expected from the fundamental oak niche. In both landscape types, multiple predictor variables representing ecological and human-influenced processes were needed to build a good model, and several models performed almost equally well. Models accounting for the different anthropogenic influences on landscape structure and processes consistently performed better than models based exclusively on natural biogeographical and ecological predictors. Thus, our results for veteran oaks clearly illustrate the challenges to distribution modeling raised by the ubiquitous influence of humans, even in a moderately populated region, but also show that predictions can be improved by explicitly addressing these anthropogenic complexities.

AB  - Repeated fertilization of forests to increase biomass production is an environmentally controversial proposal, the effects of which we assessed on breeding birds in stands of young Norway spruce (Picea abies), in an intensively managed forest area in southern Sweden. Our results show that fertilized stands had 38% more species and 21% more individuals than unfertilized stands. Compared with stands under traditional management, the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds. We cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers. Future studies should focus on structural and compositional effects of fertilization processes during the entire rotation period and at assessing its effects in a landscape context.

KW  - CHILDRENS PARTICIPATION
AB  - Several experiments on children's participation in urban planning in Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Italy have demonstrated that young people are sharp analysts of their settings and creative producers of ideas for planning but the authorities are reluctant to expand their top-down, expert-based mode of urban planning to include new groups, such as young people. Will the application of Internet in participatory planning provide the young some opportunities for having a say in environmental issues? It is argued in the article, on the basis of three new case studies of action research in Finland that internet-assisted urban planning with young people might provide more space for young people to get involved in neighbourhood development, if the projects are carefully integrated with the planning cycle and the cultural context.

AB  - We combine historical maps and satellite derived data to reconstruct the development of a Swedish boreal landscape over the past 300 years. The aim is to understand legacies from past use patterns in present-day forest composition and consequences for conservation objectives from a landscape perspective. We analyze landscape development in cross-tabulation matrixes, building change trajectories. These trajectories are tested in linear models to explain the distribution of present-day landscape composition of coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forests >110 years. Of 49 tested change trajectories, 11 showed a significant association. Associations for mixed and coniferous forests were similar and linked to characteristics such as forest continuity, which characterized the studied landscape. Deciduous older forests did not show any association to forest continuity but were more likely to occur on areas that specifically shifted from forests with grazing in the 1720s to open impediment (likely indicating low tree coverage) in the 1850s. There were large shifts and spatial redistribution in ownerships over time. Use patterns and legacies varied between small- and large-scale ownership categories as well as within small-scale categories. The legacies found in the study indicate a complex origin of heterogeneous landscape elements such as older deciduous forests. Additionally, the origin of the legacies indicates a potential need to diversify conservation management based on the influence of past use patterns. Despite large inconsistencies in historical and contemporary data we argue that this type of analysis could be used to further understand the distribution of landscape elements important for conservation objectives.

AB  - Existing approaches for the assessment of forest management intensity lack a widely accepted, purely quantitative measure for ranking a set of forest stands along a gradient of management intensity. We have developed a silvicultural management intensity indicator (SMI) which combines three main characteristics of a given stand: tree species, stand age and aboveground, living and dead wooden biomass. Data on these three factors are used as input to represent the risk of stand loss, which is a function of tree species and stand age, and stand density, which is a function of the silvicultural regime, stand age and tree species. Consequently, the indicator consists of a risk component (SMIr) and a density component (SMId). We used SMI to rank traditional management of the main Central European tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies [Karst.] L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea L.). By analysing SMI over their whole rotation period, we found the following ranking of management intensity: oak < beech < pinea parts per thousand(a)spruce. Additionally, we quantified the SMI of actual research plots of the German Biodiversity exploratories, which represent unmanaged and managed forest stands including conifer forests cultivated outside their natural range. SMI not only successfully separate managed from unmanaged forests, but also reflected the variability of forest management and stand properties across the entire sample and within the different management groups. We suggest using SMI to quantify silvicultual management intensity of stands differing in species composition, age, silvicultural system (even-aged vs. uneven-aged), thinning grade and stages of stand conversion from one stand type into another. Using SMI may facilitate the assessment of the impact of forest management intensity on biodiversity in temperate forests.

AB  - Aim There is an intense debate about whether habitat fragmentation has a negative or positive effect on biodiversity. We examined whether species richness and incidence of forest plants were negatively or positively associated with fragmented forest configuration. We also analysed whether the results support the fragmentation threshold hypothesis with fragmentation effects only in landscapes with small habitat amount. Location Sodermanland province, south-eastern Sweden (8,388 km(2)). Methods Data consisted of plant distribution maps and landscape data on forest amount and configuration in 2.5 km x 2.5 km quadrats. We carried out models including forest area together with clumpiness index (CL models) or edge density (ED models) as the measure of habitat configuration. We focused on plant taxa with positive association between incidence and forest area (163 taxa in CL models; 119 taxa in ED models). Results Responses to fragmented configuration were negative more often than by random (33 and 22 taxa in CL and ED models, respectively; includes only models without significant forest area x configuration interaction), whereas positive responses were rare (four taxa in both models). When forest area x configuration interaction was significant, the most common response had a negative effect of fragmented configuration when forest area was low and no effect of configuration when forest area was high, which agrees with the fragmentation threshold hypothesis. Species richness also had this type of response. In another common interactive response, the effect of fragmented configuration was negative at low forest area and positive at high forest area. Main conclusions Responses to fragmented forest configuration, when significant, were usually negative. When responses to fragmented configuration were modulated by forest area, they were negative when forest area was low. The findings of complex interaction between forest area and configuration have implications for selection of appropriate patch sizes in sustainable forest management.

AB  - Environmental and conservation decisions are often complex, which results in complexity also in policy assessments. Conservation decisions have implications for different stakeholders and typically draw on multidisciplinary knowledge bases, incorporating natural, physical and social sciences, politics and ethics. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a potentially important tool for supporting conservation policy decisions. This article reports a spatially referenced MCDA of policy instrument scenarios for conserving forest biodiversity in Southwestern Finland. The effects of the realistic policy instruments designed in dialogue with stakeholders included voluntary permanent conservation, enforced spatially concentrated permanent conservation, voluntary permanent conservation with active nature management, and voluntary temporary conservation. These instruments were compared by combining forest-owner survey, MCDA and ex ante impact evaluation. The main objective was to find the forest biodiversity conservation instrument that would produce the highest total benefit. The effects of the different instruments were evaluated with ecological, economic, social, and institutional criteria after a 20-year time period. The results showed minor differences between the instruments, with voluntary permanent and voluntary temporary conservation producing the largest total benefit. Despite the small differences, the analysis was robust in showing that voluntary instruments were more favourable than enforced permanent conservation.

AB  - With 95% of Norway's electricity production based on hydropower, a renewable source, and most households and institutions based on direct electric heating, the development of biomass-based district heating systems is set within a rather different environment than many other European countries. A case study of a medium-scale district heating network in Norway's Inland Region is used here to evaluate a set of relational aspects which influence and shape local bioenergy development in Norway. Interviews with Norwegian bioenergy actors are used to evaluate the enabling and hindering aspects of bioenergy governance. Framed by national and European Union energy policies, the study focuses on the role of socio-cultural and economic issues which are examined with reference to a local case study. Additionally, the role of knowledge production and distribution is highlighted and displays the importance of rationalities and their shifting properties for bioenergy governance. While the initial motivation for bioenergy development in Norway is often understood as residing at the local level with resistance deriving from certain national institutions, this study portrays bioenergy development to be (re-)produced through heterogeneous and shifting sets of relational assemblages. Accordingly, the findings refute such black and white accounts and present the complexity of bioenergy governance spaces.

AB  - New tools and forms of cooperation at the landscape level are needed in order for forestry and environmental conservation to co-exist in areas with many land owners. Awareness has existed for several years in Sweden that cooperation at the landscape level is essential for protecting areas of high environmental value. This awareness has come to expression in several projects and initiatives. One of these projects is the Ostra Vatterbranterna Partnership, a successful example of the new orientation toward environmental management as formulated in the government bill Sustainable protection of nature areas: new working methods with a focus on collaboration and increased dialog by involving more actors and utilizing a greater combination of steering instruments. This development resonates with the growing trend toward deregulation and less state intervention in environmental management, implying a stronger emphasis on new governance structures and market-driven processes. This paper examines the preconditions for a development toward governance-oriented forms of steering in the area of environmental policy and law, with specific emphasis on the protection of forestry areas with high environmental value. Paralleling this development, the transformation of environmental public administration is analyzed, using a model representing three different perspectives on administration's role, values and meaning, showing state action's progressive transition from "rowing" to "steering" to "serving" and facilitating.

AB  - Older adults have been recognized as a key tourist segment for cultural tourism. Despite the growing population of older adults, limited research have explored their experiences and needs within digital cultural experiences. Therefore, this research note takes on an exploratory approach in understanding older adults' perceptions towards digital cultural experiences in the context of two 'super-aged' nations: Finland and Japan. The findings illustrate that differences do exist, and that Finnish older adults are found to be more open to technology-use in the context of digital cultural experiences than their Japanese counterparts. Implications for e-tourism research and management are discussed.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the external and internal factors that support or challenge a possible transformation of Arctic Sweden into a major ski destination under a changing climate. Design/methodology/approach The paper questions future availability of the physical and the human factors that foster ski tourism development in Arctic Sweden and suggests a comparative case study in relation to the already existing large resort-based ski destinations in Arctic Finland. Findings Preliminary documentary analysis shows that the governmental and the industrial discourses over the past decade have acknowledged a competitive edge for Sweden and its northernmost regions in particular and may even propose a structural shift for ski tourism in the near future agenda. The visualisations based on natural snow projections presented in this paper confirm this comparative advantage but other technical and socioeconomic development factors are further discussed, in relation to Arctic Finland. Research limitations/implications Future research agenda is suggested to cover, first, assessment of natural and technical snow reliability of existing and all potential ski areas in Sweden and within its competitive set extending to all the Nordics and the Alps, then, incorporation of adaptive capacities of the suppliers but especially the likely substitution tendencies of the consumers, and finally, evaluation of the overall situation in terms of the regional development needs. Social implications It is apparent that land use conflicts will arise in case of large ski resort-based destination development in Arctic Sweden, especially around the environmentally protected areas, which are not only already important attractions for nature-based tourism but also traditional livelihoods for the Sami. Originality/value This is the first paper to discuss a potential regional and structural shift of ski tourism in Sweden.

AB  - Urban forests are often modified and fragmented by human land use and the original habitat might exist only in remnant patches. Due to their specific habitat requirements and unwillingness to move through matrix many forest-dwelling mammals are susceptible to changes in landscape structure. It is important to understand how the availability of suitable habitat and landscape fragmentation affect species distributions, and what landscape characteristics are essential to the persistence of a given species to conserve urban wildlife. We investigated the effect of landscape composition and configuration on the occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel, a small-sized arboreal rodent, in a partly urbanized area of Eastern Finland. All suitable and potential forest patches were searched to determine the presence or absence of species, and the landscape characteristics of occupied sites were compared to those of unoccupied sites. Flying squirrels occurred both at the edges of large suitable forested areas, but also in small forest fragments within residential areas. Surprisingly, urban areas did not have a negative effect on the flying squirrel occurrence. Occurrence probability was not either associated with the proportion of suitable habitat, but occupied sites contained larger amount of movement habitat and had shorter distances to nearest occupied sites than unoccupied sites. Our results show that flying squirrels can exist in urbanized landscape and near residential areas, but more detailed information on habitat use and survival is still needed to determine the long-term persistence and viability of the urban populations.

AB  - Whereas assessing health is a mandatory feature of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Sweden, health impacts are often vaguely described, making their health preventive role meaningless. In 2006, a mine was planned in the reindeer grazing lands of a Sami community in northern Sweden. While an EIA was conducted in 2013, health was superficially addressed. The aim of this study was to describe and reflect on the health impact assessment (HIA) process that assessed the potential health risks and/or benefits that the mine establishment could bring to the Sami community. The classic five steps of an HIA are presented. The literature review showed a scarcity of studies regarding HIA on mining in indigenous territories. Participants in the study were currently experiencing negative psychosocial health effects and described potential adverse social and health effects originating from the loss of their traditional way of life. Despite certain challenges, this study proved that it is possible to conduct a comprehensive HIA in the context of Sami health research. Given that mining in Sweden occurs mostly in Sami territory and the adverse health effects found in this study, the lack of comprehensive HIAs on mining projects in Sweden raises serious concerns.

AB  - In this article, we explore how forestry scientists have promoted and defended particular definitions of economic sustainability as a response to socio-economic challenges. Drawing on an analysis of Finnish forestry textbooks, we discuss the evolving conceptualizations in terms of co-production of scientific ideas and social orders. We argue that to fully understand what economic sustainability means in forestry one has to analyze the choices and preferences concerning the components of scientific ideas, and to identify links between these choices and the evolving societal discourses, social norms, rules of authority, power relations and partnerships, as well as historical events.

AB  - Cities worldwide are increasingly using green infrastructure to mitigate challenges related to stormwater, in an approach regarded as sustainable stormwater management (SSM). Various governance factors have been identified as one of the major barriers to SSM implementation. In this study, we examined specific governance factors influencing local SSM implementation in four case cities in Sweden and China. Based on systems thinking, we first developed a general causal loop diagram (SSM-CLD) illustrating the interrelations between previously identified influencing governance factors in SSM. We then used this general SSM-CLD as a framework to conduct and analyze 23 semi-structured interviews with local government officers in the four case cities. Based on the analysis, we summarized the most frequently mentioned governance factors and created one SSM-CLD for each case city. We then examined the main differences between the local SSM-CLDs and the general SSM-CLD, and the differences between the Chinese and Swedish case cities. The results revealed that, in the two Chinese case cities, the role of national policy in setting local leaders' priorities, the strong organizational set-up, and planning instruments are significant for SSM implementation. In the two Swedish case cities, public awareness, local government politicians' priorities, and trust in SSM performance are important for SSM implementation. Acquiring funding for long-term maintenance of SSM was identified as a common challenge in all four cities studied. These results provide a better understanding and potential lessons for other cities on how governance factors influence SSM.

AB  - Sweden does not have gated communities, but this paper argues that processes of gating and the associated consequences are apparent in Sweden, particularly in metropolitan regions. Based on interviews, observations and analysis of previous research, the article identifies the rise of urban gating and gated housing. Urban gating restricts access to previously public land through material gating and results in a loss of the right to use-value of urban land. The rise of a new and exclusive form of gated housing associated with the lifestyles of the mobile middle class, referred to here, as the residential hotel, is spotlighted, prompting questions about the concentration of affluence in already privileged areas and the reinforcing effect of gating on existing patterns of socio-spatial polarization.

Design/methodology/approach This paper illustrates the trend observed based on three major observations from Norway and links the observed trend to the micro-level to meso- and macro-trends. Findings As a result, it was found that due to irresponsible behavior the Norwegian allemansratten (Right to Roam) system is under pressure. Because of this, the freedom to enjoy the Norwegian nature risks to be limited by regulations. Originality/value The insights presented in this paper contribute to the debate on nature-based tourism, sustainable and responsible tourism and link with the debate on overtourism in the context of nature areas.

AB  - In both Finland and Sweden, decentralisation has traditionally been an essential cultural policy aim. This article explores how, by pursuing decentralisation, the regional jurisdictions have been presented with more possibilities to fulfil their purposes and in this way, gain legitimacy in cultural policy. Based on the analysis of political, legal, and administrative documents, three main periods of regional decentralisation in cultural policies are identified: regions as vehicles of welfare policy, regionalisation, and competitive regions. In both countries, national governments have promoted the regional level's agency, and in doing so, potential institutional change in cultural policy. However, the increase of the regional level's role has been limited by the countries' strongly institutionalised cultural policy systems.

AB  - The ongoing forest biodiversity protection programme in Finland (METSO) relies on voluntary participation of family forest owners. Even though the programme has gained wide acceptability among owners, compared to traditional conservation such as land acquisition, more owners need to be engaged. In this study, we examined how the new protection measures have diffused among forest owners. This analysis will help find means to promote the protection among owners who could but have not yet participated. The theoretical background is innovation diffusion. We focused on the communication channels and attributes of innovation that would be important for the rest of the adopters. Data were gathered from owners who have protected their forests in the eastern part of Finland. The results showed that the idea of protection has reached forest owners mainly via certain advisors of a regional Forestry Centre or via forestry magazines and newspapers. In the future, it is important that the advisors of local Forest Management Associations and employees of timber buying companies promote the programme more, since they are the most familiar forestry experts for many owners. In addition, it would be necessary to increase the role of peer forest owners and enhance the visibility of protected areas. Highlighting the rationality and ease of protection to potential adopters is important. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiversity decline undermines the conditions for life on Earth resulting in calls for transformative governance of biodiversity. Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, national biodiversity strategies provide the primary mechanism through which governments demonstrate their conservation efforts. With many countries due to develop new strategies under the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, it is timely to assess existing ones to identify policy design elements that could be 'ratcheted up' to meet the transformative agenda. This article analyzes and compares the policy designs of national biodiversity strategies in Australia, France and Sweden. We cover problem framing, policy goals, targeted groups, implementing agents, and policy instruments, to draw lessons on how national strategies can be designed to further support transformation of biodiversity governance. We identify elements in these strategies that can be used to inspire future ones: a negotiated framing of biodiversity and participatory processes in France, nested and integrated goals, targets and measures in Sweden, and an engagement with indigenous knowledge in Australia. However, to bring about transformative change, the analysis also shows the need for novel and fundamental re-designs to successfully target indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, shift power relations, and make biodiversity conservation a priority rather than an option.

AB  - Public participation in regional and local forest planning in Finland was researched. The questions were: (1) What is the purpose of public participation? (2) What are the challenges of public participation? The results are based on the analysis of discourse communities in a case study concerning a Regional Forest Programme and forest management planning. It was shown that the purpose of participation was to promote communication at the regional level and to gather information at the local level. The general conclusion is, that the regional forest programmes include practices to offer possibilities for communication among participants. This does not mean, that all the programme processes have reached consensus automatically. The case studied here reached compromise. The case study points out problems faced, if public participation would become common practice at the local level on non-industrial private forests lands. In forest management planning it would result in an excessively demanding mediator/expert role for the planner. The need to consider all relevant issues, e.g. biodiversity management, would also become apparent. The study supports the idea that public participation as communication has better possibilities to promote sustainable forest management than public participation as information gathering.

AB  - Tackling biodiversity loss requires new forms of expertise in forestry. Drawing on a case study in Finland, the paper analyses how professional foresters are invited to protect the heterogeneity of forest ecosystems while they simultaneously work to homogenise these habitats for improved productivity. To understand how formerly irrelevant biological knowledge, and related skills and expertise gain credibility in forestry decision-making in such a complex policy context, the paper adopts a two-fold theoretical approach. On one hand, it focuses on the tools and techniques which redirect expert practice, introducing new rationalities, roles and routines for professional foresters. On the other hand, it seeks to view foresters as complex sociological actors who reinvent themselves as biodiversity experts by strategically mobilising various kinds of resources to negotiate their role and status as experts. This two-fold analysis addresses how the status of biological knowledge is determined by the tension between formally configured expert rationalities and expert identities and roles mobilised through informal interactions. Three expert strategies in engaging with biodiversity are identified based on the personal histories, motivations and identities of the foresters: the ambassador, navigator and bolshie. Through these strategies professional foresters interact with each other and with landowners while implementing biodiversity policies, hence influencing the policy outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper offers an approach to long-term planning for an industrial sector that is sensitive to climate change, the state of adjacent natural environments and the associated socioeconomic developments. The paper combines exploratory and target-seeking scenarios to understand the future challenges of nature-based blue tourism under alternative global futures, and to develop sequences of actions to accomplish the best achievable future outcome for blue tourism at a local scale. We detail a bottom-up approach to scenario development for tourism, with local stakeholders developing local scenarios within the boundaries provided by the locally extended Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), widely used in climate research. As a demonstration of the approach, a group of invited stakeholders developed locally extended scenario narratives and the adaptation plans for blue tourism for coastal areas surrounding the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. The co-creation process yielded several recommendations for immediate action concerning protection of the coastal environments, land use planning, internal communication with the sector and coordinated monitoring of economic, ecological, social and cultural sustainability indicators. The approach offers a way forward for systematically assessing the future risks and opportunities that a changing environment and society create for blue tourism.

AB  - Increasing populations of mesopredators are suspected to cause declines in vulnerable wildlife to the extent that mesopredator decimation actions (culling) have become commonplace. Design constraints, especially a lack of spatial replication, often hamper the assessment of the impact of such actions. However, extensive temporal replication (i.e. time series) and accounting for potentially confounding variables may alleviate this problem.
   In alpine-arctic tundra, the red fox Vulpes vulpes is increasing, while many bird species are declining, likely due to increased predation. Here, we assessed the impact of a long-term (12-year) and spatially extensive (similar to 3,500 km(2)) red fox culling action on the red-listed willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in the Norwegian Arctic. Ptarmigan populations were monitored annually in the impact area and in an adjacent no-action area, including a 5-year period before the action commenced. While logistical constraints prohibited monitoring of red fox population densities, the number of culled foxes and three influential food web covariates were monitored after the onset of the culling action.
   A Before-After-Control-Impact-Paired-Series (BACIPS) analysis without food web covariates indicated that red fox culling curbed the decline of the population in the impact area, and that ptarmigan population density became similar to 25% higher than in the reference area.
   Spatially and temporally variable drivers within the food web confounded the simple BACIPS analysis. Accounting for three food web drivers as covariates in a linear mixed model after the onset of action, yielded a more unbiased impact estimate that amounted to similar to 40% higher ptarmigan population density (4.3 more ptarmigan/km(2)) in the red fox impact area.
   Synthesis and applications. We provide the first evidence of the role of the recent expansion of red fox in the decline of bird populations in tundra. We also show that red fox culling may be able to curb such declines, given that management actions are large scale and long term. As mesopredator culling campaigns are often expensive and controversial, it is important that their impacts are accurately assessed. We demonstrate that the accuracy of impact assessments can be profoundly increased by monitoring drivers of food web dynamics that impinge on the target species so that such drivers can be included as covariates in the analysis. This applies in particular to declining bird populations in boreal and arctic food webs ruled by strong multi-annual interaction cycles.

AB  - The opening up of Finnish forest policymaking to new interest groups and a change to more flexible forms of partnerships at multiple levels signals a transition to new governance relations. Drawing on the concept of institutional capacity, we analyze the governance potential of stakeholder forums, called Regional Forest Councils, to balance economic considerations with ecological ones in preparing Regional Forest Programs. More specifically, we look into knowledge resources that are produced and shared in the Regional Forest Program process, relational resources such as trust and reciprocity created and sustained in the Regional Forest Councils, and the capacity to mobilize resources and take action to implement the program. The two processes we have analyzed demonstrate various elements of institutional capacity for collective action, and illustrate the challenges that a traditional hierarchically organized and expert-driven sector can face in developing more inclusive forms of governance.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a document study, survey, and workshops held in a Swedish municipality. The empirical focus of the study is on the role of transport in municipal planning and transport's potential contribution to urban sustainability in the municipality. The case study highlights a problem familiar to many municipalities a transport sector largely dependent on fossil fuel private vehicles that generates significant impacts on the climate and environment, along with other economic and social costs. However, despite awareness of these negative impacts, it is difficult to implement measures to reduce the use of private vehicles and enable a transition towards a sustainable transport sector. In Sweden, municipalities have exclusive planning monopolies and an extensive range of other powers. Despite this, many municipalities are struggling to reduce car dependency and enable sustainable mobility. This paper questions the extent to which the municipality and its governance processes are capable of contributing toward sustainable development, both locally and globally, in the absence of radical measures. In particular, the paper considers why, despite having adopted objectives to promote sustainable mobility, does the municipality struggle with the implementation of measures to enable sustainable mobility? Why is there a difference between words and actions?

KW  - Norway
AB  - Norwegian agriculture depends heavily on governmental subsidies, due to small farming units and high costs. Due to a limited home market, many agricultural productions are also quantum regulated. Milk and grain production was regulated starting in the 1950 using region specific prices. At the level of three counties in south-eastern Norway, this policy resulted in an increase in the grain producing area from 30 to 80% of total agricultural area causing a similar reduction in grassland area over a 30 year period. The change in land use caused by this policy more than doubled the estimated soil losses by water erosion. During the late seventies extensive land levelling in the same region stimulated by subsidies lead to an estimated two-three fold increase in soil erosion. The increase was especially high when former ravine landscapes used for pasture were levelled and turned into arable land that was ploughed in autumn. Very visible erosion and increasing negative offsite effects on water quality together with overproduction put an end to the subsidies for land levelling. Erosion research was started around 1980 and the results from this research lead to the introduction of several kinds of payments in the early 1990 to encourage more sustainable agricultural production. Since the policy changed there has been changes in cultivating systems and a reduction in soil erosion has been estimated. Thus, farmers' behaviour and soil erosion in Norway is strongly influenced by agricultural and environmental policy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fragmented urban forest remnants are characterised by sharp edges and are bordered by various land-use types, which may have a considerable effect on the fauna and flora at forest edges, and into forest interiors. To investigate the effects of differentially contrasting edges (low vs. intermediate vs. high) on carabid beetle assemblages in urban boreal forests, we placed pitfall traps along a gradient from 6 m into three matrix types (secondary forest vs. grassland vs. asphalt) up to 60 m into urban forest patches in the cities of Vantaa and Helsinki, southern Finland. Individual species and carabid beetle assemblages were strongly affected by edge contrasts and distance from the forest edge. The strongest effect on individual species was caused by high contrasting edges: generalist and open-habitat species were favoured or not affected while forest specialists were affected negatively. Effects of the abundances of potential prey and competitors on the carabid beetles were also evaluated. Forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively to neutrally associated with springtail abundances while generalist and open habitat, and dryness associated species were more positively related to springtail abundances (a potential food source). In terms of potential competitors, forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively and/or neutrally affected by ant and wood ant numbers, while generalist and open-habitat species were neutrally to positively associated with these taxa. It appears that carabid beetle habitat associations are more important in the responses of these beetles across edges of different contrast than are the prey and competitor numbers collected there. We recommend the creation of "soft" or low-contrast urban edges if the aim of urban management is to protect forest carabids in cities.

AB  - As forestlands provide a variety of environmental services, the management of forest resources is a matter of public concern. In the present case of state-owned commercial forests in Finland, legislation requires specific management practices to enhance recreational benefits free of charge to the public. This choice experiment considers Finnish people's valuation of the recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests to evaluate whether the recreational benefits produced justify the related loss of profits from timber sales. We focus on three management attributes: scenic buffer zones along lakes and rivers, habitats for game birds, and the quality of scenery as reflected by the frequency of clear-cut areas along hiking trails. Marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) effects for the attributes are estimated with random parameters logit models specified in the WTP space, while preference-space models are used to estimate in physical terms the attribute levels that maximize the benefits to the public. Despite regional differences in preferences, people in all parts of Finland valued the current recreation-oriented management of state-owned commercial forests considerably. Nationwide, the aggregate benefits of recreation-enhancing management clearly exceeded the estimated opportunity costs. The most preferred levels of management attributes were slightly above the current levels, suggesting an increase in the provision of recreational services when not considering the associated costs.

AB  - During the early 2010s, Finnish wolf (Canis lupus) policy reached an impasse. Unfavorable conservation status, intensifying wolf-human conflict, civil disobedience, legislative confusion, and administrative frustration characterized the situation. As part of a participatory updating process for the Finnish national wolf management plan in 2014, we organized a nationwide wolf management forum to explore how e-participation could be used to nurture deliberation for improved wolf policy. We present our interactive method and the resulting wolf territory-based solutions to the wolf problems that the participants of a nationwide online forum identified. The theoretical and practical significance of our work is that we ascribe value to the functional features of these solutions as modifications to the action environment, shared by people and wolves. In this vein, we discuss the role of e-deliberation on the path toward an institutional fit, and we consider how local decision making could help to implement promising wolf territory-level policy interventions.

AB  - In line with the 2010 Aichi Convention for Biological Diversity, the European Union has a goal to restore 15% of degraded ecosystems and their services by the year 2020 (target 2, Europe 2020). This includes restoration of semi-natural grasslands (SNGs). Management of both intact and restored SNGs is dependent on people's willingness to manage them. Due to low profitability, management abandonment still occurs all over Europe, which highlights the need to raise farmers' and landowners' perspectives. In this study, we combined survey data and in-depth interviews with farmers/landowners managing previously restored SNGs, to understand how they perceive the restoration process, the outcome and future management. Survey and interview data were analysed in relation to biodiversity and Agri-environmental payments data from the restored sites. Almost all respondents considered the restoration successful and the re-inventoried restored SNGs also showed an increase in plant diversity. Nevertheless, 10% of the restored SNGs were abandoned again post-restoration and 40% of the respondents were unsure if they would continue the management in the future. Abandoned management may cause a negative trend in terms of decreased biological, cultural and aesthetic values, in the local community, as well as for the society in general. Most respondents explained a strong dependency on Agri-environmental payments, both as a restoration incentive and for post-restoration management. Also non-financial support from authorities in form of feedback and advice was requested, as well as support from the local community and society as a whole. Future management in a longer time perspective was strongly coupled to the farm economy, i.e. received Agri-environmental payments at farm-level and profit from selling agricultural products, and whether the farmers had successors. We conclude that both social and ecological factors, here farm economy, authority support and proper management, must be in place for long-term success of grassland restoration.

T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL

CP  - 14th International Working Meeting on Soil Micromorphology
AB  - The area of Linkoping, Sweden, has a land use history of several millennia. In the last two decades, many archaeological investigations of different types have been conducted here. They range from trial trenching to full scale excavations of large areas and are connected to the expansion of the city. The Early Iron Age landscape of the area was formed by animal husbandry and the requirements of the domesticated animals. Earlier research has revealed an intensification and specialization within animal husbandry in the region, occurring around the Birth of Christ, when farms seemed particularly to specialize towards milk production. However, this transition and its local variations is still poorly investigated. Arable farming is assumed to have been characterized by small intensively used and improved cultivated areas close to the settlements, but there are many questions still to be answered about the specific soil management types and crops. There is a need to further investigate the land use history of the area from the Early Iron Age (2440-2010 BP) until Medieval times (AD 1030-1536). As part of the archaeological excavations carried out by the Swedish National Heritage Board in 2007, six samples from three localities, all in the Linkoping municipality, were chosen for soil micromorphological analysis. At the locality of Tornby I, traces were found of anthropogenic activities including some kind of building activities, prior to a period with extensive cultivation activities nearby, presumably when the settlement was established in the Pre-Roman Iron Age (ca. 200 BC). It was followed by a period with soil management on the locality, interpreted as a kind of garden cultivation. The locality of Tornby II, was presumably used a pasture in an early period and as a cultivation field with soil improvement in a later period. At the locality of Mortlosa, dated to the Roman Iron Age (2010-1680 BP) and the Migration Period (BC/AD 550 AD), traces from two different contemporary activity areas could be differentiated within few meters of a profile: a cultivated field which has been improved with different kinds of manure through time, and presumably a pathway for animals.

AB  - The loss of non-crop habitat is often suggested to be a key driver of biodiversity decline on arable land. Grass buffer strips on cereal field edges, to reduce erosion and agro-chemical runoff into surface water, could be useful to mitigate this diversity loss as they are often assumed to provide refuge and food for invertebrates, small mammals and birds. Evidence for this idea is, however, scarce and it remains unclear whether densely vegetated buffer strips benefit biodiversity in structurally complex landscapes of Northern Europe. Here, we examined whether buffer strips affected breeding skylark Alauda avensis numbers and its main food supply (i.e. beetles Coleoptera and spiders Arachnida) on cereal fields in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. We also examined whether buffer strip effects on skylark density depended on seasonal sward height differences between sowing regimes (spring- vs. autumn-sown) as they presumably influence seasonal invertebrate accessibility. Fields with buffer strips supported on average 0.51 +/- 0.26 more skylark territories per hectare up to 100 m into the field and boosted invertebrate activity densities compared to fields without buffer strips. These effects were most apparent early in spring, but persisted throughout the sampling period, and were similar among spring and autumn sown fields. Thus, our results provide evidence to suggest that buffer strips target multiple environmental objectives on cereal fields in heterogeneous farmland. Future research should work to identify buffer strip management practices that further increase their value to biodiversity at the local scale, and investigate how they affect farmland biodiversity in different landscape types at larger spatial scales for more efficient implementation across Europe.

AB  - This paper presents conclusions from a survey among urban freight actors in the four biggest cities in Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim). The survey focus on logistic operations and transport decisions affecting the city logistics. In the studied cities we found that there is lack of emphasis on urban logistics and urban freight transport planning. The survey indicates that the missing focus on logistic activities is due to lack of co-ordination among actors involved in urban logistics, and often insufficient dialogue between city authorities and private actors who operate in the cities. Representatives from the industries do not always understand the municipal planning processes and on which level of bureaucracy the plans are accomplished.
   To solve challenges a suggestion related to urban logistics and collaboration among private and public actors is to develop structured Urban Logistic Plans. A part of such plans should be the involvement of all stakeholders in the exploitation and processes of development. The stakeholders must also be involved in policy development and strategic planning processes. The survey indicates that congestion and access to centrally located loading and unloading zones are the biggest problem for freight transport in Norwegian urban areas. From the industry, there is a request that loading and unloading zones must be incorporated as part of land use plans.
   It was also stressed that local authorities must include plans for goods deliveries in line with services from taxi and public transport in sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs). (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB  - Land-use planning has been promoted as an important tool for adaptation to climate change. However, its success depends on effective communication between researchers and decision-makers. A "risk and vulnerability assessment" (RVA) is one method to facilitate the interaction between the groups. RVAs have been performed in Norwegian land-use planning for about 20 years, and been mandatory for new development the last few years. The first part of the article reviews the history and current legal regulation of RVAs in Norway. Continuing, the main part discusses the distribution of authority and responsibility for different parts of the process and result. The key finding is that significant decisions are deferred to municipal discretion, for example, the necessity (if doubtful) and scope of the assessments. Other topics (such as the burden of costs and eligible performers) are largely unregulated, prompting some arguments about the need for further legislative effort.

AB  - During extraction of logging residues previous studies in Sweden have shown that up to 50% of the available logging residues will not reach the energy-conversion site. The remaining potential of the logging residues are therefore lost by handling either at the clear-felled site, during transportation or due to decomposition. An outtake of 100% is not possible or desired, since the Swedish Forest Agency recommends that at least 20% of the logging residues should be left at the clear-felled site after a fuel adapted logging operation. In this study the losses at the clear-felled area is examined by studying the distribution of the remaining logging residues under and between the harvester heaps as well amount of logging residues that are left at the roadside landing after comminution. The results show that most of the reaming logging residues are well distributed at the clear-felled area between the harvester heaps. Additional logging residues are left at the clear-felled area since the forwarder cannot gather all logging residues from under the harvester heaps. In addition to this a not insignificant amount of logging residues are left at the roadside landing.

AB  - Over previous decades new environmental measures have been implemented in forestry. In Fennoscandia, forest management practices were modified to set aside conservation areas and to retain trees at final felling. In this study we simulated the long-term effects of set-aside establishment and tree retention practices on the future availability of large trees and dead wood, two forest structures of documented importance to biodiversity conservation. Using a forest decision support system (Heureka), we projected the amounts of these structures over 200 years in two managed north Swedish landscapes, under management scenarios with and without set-asides and tree retention. In line with common best practice, we simulated set-asides covering 5% of the productive area with priority to older stands, as well as 5% green-tree retention (solitary trees and forest patches) including high-stump creation at final felling. We found that only tree retention contributed to substantial increases in the future density of large (DBH >= 35 cm) deciduous trees, while both measures made significant contributions to the availability of large conifers. It took more than half a century to observe stronger increases in the densities of large deciduous trees as an effect of tree retention. The mean landscape-scale volumes of hard dead wood fluctuated widely, but the conservation measures yielded values which were, on average over the entire simulation period, about 2.5 times as high as for scenarios without these measures. While the density of large conifers increased with time in the landscape initially dominated by younger forest, best practice conservation measures did not avert a long-term decrease in large conifer density in the landscape initially comprised of more old forest. Our results highlight the needs to adopt a long temporal perspective and to consider initial landscape conditions when evaluating the large-scale effects of conservation measures on forest biodiversity.

AB  - In the past decade, marine protected areas (MPAs) have become an increasingly used tool for science-based conservation and adaptive management of marine biodiversity and related natural resources. In this review paper, we report on rather complete time-course series (55 years uninterrupted) focusing on comparison of the strong difference, in number and area, in establishing marine (56 MNRs) and terrestrial (4284 TNRs) nature reserves in Sweden versus marine (7001 MPAs) and terrestrial (132742 TPAs) protected areas globally. Sweden appears to follow the overall global time trends. The large backlog of MPAs in relation to TPAs is due to several possible reasons, such as (i) unclear marine jurisdiction, (ii) marine conservation policies and programs developed later than terrestrial, (iii) higher costs for marine conservation management, (iv) conflicts in marine conservation, especially the fishery, and (v) the general public's historically weak awareness of the status of the marine environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Native breeds are domestic animals that have adapted to local conditions. Their genetic and cultural values are high. The conservation of these breeds is maintained by national conservation programmes and agricultural support schemes in Nordic countries. In addition to financial support, the conservation of native breeds requires that their importance in society be widely understood and recognised. This is especially crucial in the local communities in which such breeds are kept. Farmers raising native breeds should be highly motivated to utilise these breeds in animal production. This article examines the extent to which farmers and stakeholders recognise the genetic and cultural significance of conservation, and how the requirements of good governance are met in current conservation arrangements. Moreover, we contemplate the potential to amalgamate the management of animal genetic resources and their cultural environment. Native breeds are domestic animal populations that have adapted to their habitats. The genetic value of breeds has been known for a long time, and recently more attention has been paid to their cultural value. Due to both ecological and cultural significance, it is important that native breeds continue to be bred in their native environments. This is supported by various financial support schemes. Support schemes rarely cover the financial gap in output compared to commercial breeds. A solution to this has been sought in special products, such as cheese or wool, and other businesses, such as animal-assisted care and tourism. Less attention has been paid to the role of administration and good governance in the maintenance of native breeds. In this study, a questionnaire was sent to all registered keepers of native breeds in Finland. This survey clarified their reasons for keeping native breeds and their ideas for improving governance structures and practices. The results were discussed in stakeholder workshops, and in a Nordic context. The results show that genetic and cultural values are recognised in several documents and programmes, but farmers need to be engaged more in the design of support schemes and practices.

AB  - Biodiversity is decreasing at an alarming rate. Current policies focus on the most valuable species and habitats but cannot stop the degradation occurring in less valuable habitats. One solution is offsetting the loss of biodiversity caused by development projects. The basic idea of biodiversity offsetting is simple: a developer must provide an improvement in biodiversity so that the lost ecological value is compensated for. A banking mechanism for offsetting entails a third party providing offsets for developers to purchase, and thus, an offset market emerges. We develop an equilibrium model to analyse the offset markets and apply the model to the Finnish economy and three selected boreal habitats. We examine how the market depends on trading ratios, the presence of an intermediary and the realization of risks associated with uncertainty. An intermediary can facilitate the market participants meeting each other with minimal transaction costs and safeguard against risks. The results show that the size of the offset markets could potentially be quite considerable and providing offsets could be a profitable business for landowners in Finland. The outcome of the restoration investment and a possible time delay between biodiversity losses and gains impact the trading ratios and thus, have a major impact on the market equilibrium. An intermediary may significantly decrease the costs of compensation for developers, provided that it can provide mature offsets when needed.

AB  - The loss and subdivision of habitat into smaller and more spatially isolated units due to human actions has been shown to adversely affect species worldwide. We examined how changes in old forest cover during eight years were associated with the cumulative number of fledged offspring at the end of study period in Eurasian treecreepers (Certhia familiaris) in Central Finland. We were specifically interested in whether the initial level of old forest cover moderated this relation. We applied a flexible and powerful approach, latent growth curve modelling in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, to create trajectories describing changes in old forest cover through time, and studied how this change at both the territory core and landscape scales impacted fledging numbers. Our main finding was that at the territory core scale the negative impact of habitat loss on fledging numbers was lessened by the higher levels of initial forest cover, while no association was found at the landscape scale. Our study highlights a powerful, but currently under-utilised methodology among ecologists that can provide important information about biological responses to changes in the environment, providing a mechanistic way to study how land cover dynamics can affect species responses.

AB  - The continued global biodiversity crisis necessitates the continuation and development of new well-designed monitoring strategies and action plans with particular focus on under-represented countries and regions. However, limited resources in terms of budget and availability of qualified field personnel can restrict the geographical coverage of monitoring efforts. Focusing monitoring efforts on a representative subset of species and locations can improve cost-efficiency. Optimal performance of multi-species indicators derived from such an approach requires objective methods for species selection and a sampling design that reduces inherent sampling bias caused by regional differences in habitat availability or accessibility. To explore the performance of a multi-species indicator across different regions within a nation, we developed a multi-species indicator (MSI) for farmland birds in Norway using objective niche-based selection of species. We compare the performance of this indicator at national and regional scales (Central and East regions) in Norway, and between urban and rural sites within regions. The seven-species indicator obtained from the species selection provided similar indicator values and trends for Norway and the Central and East regions, as well as for rural sites within the combined Central + East region. All trends were defined as showing moderate decline from 2007-2016. Urban sites within the combined Central + East region provided trend estimates that showed stronger decline than rural areas in the same region during the time span. Our results emphasize the need to control for sampling bias when structuring monitoring programmes such as a Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). This is especially important if limited resources restrict the geographical coverage of the monitoring scheme. We recommend that monitoring schemes follow a stratified random sampling design that represents both the availability of different land cover types and their distribution with regard to proximity to highly populated areas. If that is not possible, statistically weighting data from different regions or landscapes is likely to be necessary.

AB  - In 2012, the four countries hosting the Svalbard population of pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus along its flyway launched an International Species Management Plan for the population. One of the aims was to reduce conflicts between geese and agriculture to an acceptable level. Since 2006, Norway has offered subsidies to farmers that provide refuge areas for geese on their land. We evaluate the mid-Norwegian goose management subsidy scheme, with a view to its adjustment to prevailing ecological and socio-economic parameters. The analysis indicates that the legitimacy of the scheme is highly dependent on transparency of knowledge management and accountability of management scheme to the farming community. Among farmers, as well as front-line officials, outcomes of prioritisation processes within the scheme are judged unfair when there is an evident mismatch between payments and genuine damage. We suggest how the scheme can be made more fair and responsive to ecological changes, within a framework of adaptive management.

AB  - At the international policy level, there is a clear link between access to information about forests and the work towards sustainable land use. However, involving forests in planning for sustainable development (SuD) at the Swedish local level, by means of municipal comprehensive planning (MCP), is complicated by sector structure and legislation. Currently, there is a gap or hole in the MCP process when it comes to use and access to knowledge about forest conditions and forest land use. This hole limits the possibilities to formulate well-informed municipal visions and goals for sustainable forest land use as well as for overall SuD. Here we introduce an approach for compilation and presentation of geographic information to increase the preconditions for integrating forest information into Swedish MCP. We produce information about forest ownership patterns and forest conditions in terms of age and significant ecological and social values in forests for a case study municipality. We conclude that it is possible to effectively compile geographic and forest-related information to fill the hole in the municipal land use map. Through our approach, MCP could be strengthened as a tool for overall land use planning and hence as a base in SuD planning.

AB  - Climate change is projected to be particularly strong in the northern latitudes. Thus, boreal or arctic species are especially susceptible to the effects of climate warming. In this work we forecasted changes in the distributions of 27 northern land bird species in the 21st century, based on predicted rates of climate change. We used climate and bird atlas data of Finland and northern Norway from 1971-1990 to establish bioclimatic envelope models for each species. Next, these models were applied to two climate scenarios (A2 and B1) from the general circulation model HadCM3 to forecast potential future distributions of the study species over a larger area also covering parts of nearby Sweden and Russia. This area stretches through the boreal and continental arctic zone in northern Europe. In the A2 scenario the predicted global change in mean temperature is 3.8 degrees C by 2100 and in the B1 scenario 2.0 degrees C. Our results suggest that most of the northern land bird species will lose most of their climatic space by 2080 both in the more severe (A2, average predicted range decline: -83.6%) and in the less severe scenario (B1, average change: -73.6%). A large proportion (over two thirds) of the species considered here is thus susceptible to major range contractions in this geographical region. These climate change-induced threats are of importance because the Arctic Ocean represents a natural barrier for northward movement of species. To reduce the negative effects of climate change on the northern species, relatively large areas of continuous habitats in a connected reserve network should be preserved. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pollen records and radiocarbon dates from cultivation layers were compiled to explore agricultural changes in southwestern Norway, with a focus on cereals and associated herbs. Variations in the pollen composition were examined using rarefaction and multivariate analyses. The results showed that prehistoric cultivation layers were preserved in the region from c. 2200 BC to AD 1400. That the landscape was open and dominated by grassland is inferred from the preponderance of grass and other herbaceous pollen, originating from meadows and pastures. A few annual weeds were associated with cereals, such as Spergula arvensis and Polygonum persicaria. The main change in our record occurred during the Early Iron Age (c. 500 BC-AD 600), when cultivated fields and grassland expanded at the expense of woodland, and was probably associated with the establishment of permanent fields and hay-meadows. This study shows that pollen analysed from cultivation layers can be synthesised to provide a regional picture of land-use development.

AB  - This paper investigates where and how sustainable transport goals are translated into public transport planning and operations. The case where this is explored is the Regional Public Transport Authority (RPTA) in Stockholm, Sweden. By drawing upon recent discussions on policy translation and political-administrative relationships, sustainable transport is found to be translated in two different collaborative spaces in the RTPA. In the market side of the authority, which is mainly preoccupied with procurement of traffic and compliance issues, sustainable transport is translated into quantitative goals (including biofuels, emissions, noise, etc.) and mechanically reproduced from the politicians via the civil servants to the private operators. In the planning side of the authority, sustainability measurements have been hard to quantify and the challenge to integrate land-use and transport planning is resolved in an organic manner, in specific projects, between the strategic transport planners in the RPTA and the land-use planners in the municipalities, at a distance from the politicians' involvement. Throughout the RPTA, sustainable transport has broadened to also include social sustainability, although this has been difficult to translate into quantitative measurements, which is the desired mode of governance by the politicians.

TI  - International trade in wood products: Its role in the land use change and forestry carbon cycle

KW  - SINKS
AB  - Accounting harvested wood products and their trade as an integral part of the carbon cycle of a managed forest is a challenging task. Nevertheless, an appropriate way is especially needed now that harvested wood products may be included in Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The adoption of a method for accounting for these flows in the IPCC guidelines may have implications for the trade of wood products and thus on global forest management.
   Four methods of accounting for wood products in an international perspective are analyzed in the present study. The aim is to obtain insight in the technical and policy implications of the proposed methods. These methods include the present default IPCC method and three alternatives: flow consumption, flow production, and stock change. All four methodologies are applied to the 1990 data of Gabon, Sweden, and The Netherlands.
   The impact of accounting for wood products using alternative methods has - in some cases - a large impact on the carbon balance of the Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) sector. In the case of The Netherlands, it was found that the LUCF carbon balance could be `converted' from a sink into a source depending on the method chosen. However, the LUCF sector is very small compared to the total national carbon balance in The Netherlands. In Sweden, a country where the forest sector plays an important role, the alternative wood product methods influence the total national carbon balance by 34%. In Gabon, a country with conversion forestry, the impact of alternative wood product methods hardly influences the LUCF carbon balance because the emissions from deforestation are very large.
   The accounting method may have a large impact on the way countries regard their trade in wood products. It may be possible for countries to buy a sink through the wood products trade, by importing products faster than they decompose domestically. In the case of Gabon with its conversion forestry (the change from forest into other types of land use, like agriculture, it was found that under the flow consumption method, this country can partly export the carbon sources resulting from nonsustainable forest management. Nor is this latter method consistent with the energy chapter of the IPCC guidelines. The stock change method seems to be a suitable method, combining precise accounting and simplicity. This method is also an incentive for the use of wood in long-life products and bioenergy, and for sustainable forest management.

AB  - Species and ecosystems are under constant pressure from a rapidly-growing human population. Human tolerance of carnivores, including the willingness to live in areas with these predators, is key to the success of large carnivore conservation. In the Scandinavian Peninsula, large carnivore populations conflict with human activity; low tolerance among local people may lead to illegal hunting. A survey of 2521 Scandinavian respondents to measure environmental value orientation, using the new environmental paradigm (NEP) scale and attitudes toward large carnivores, revealed attitudes towards the presence of carnivores were not related to carnivore abundance. Nor was there a significant relationship between environmental value orientation and personal experiences with loss of domestic sheep or hunting dogs. Environmental values were mainly explained by country differences; Swedes had a more ecocentric value orientation than Norwegians. Significantly more Norwegians (45 %) than Swedes (19 %) responded that there were too many carnivores in their country. Historic differences in how government is perceived between Norway and Sweden may result in different attitudes towards illegal hunting and towards carnivores. Specifically, Norwegians may hold a more anthropocentric view, based on a suspicion of central authorities, whereas Swedes may hold a more ecocentric view.

AB  - Modern forestry practices have decreased the abundance of coarse woody debris (CWD), and as a result many species that depend on dead wood are now threatened. This implies a need to develop forestry practices that maintain biodiversity. We examined the conservation value of experimental spruce logs (control logs, logs placed in natural shade, and cut tree tops) for wood-inhabiting fungi in two forest stands, one nature reserve and one mature managed forest, in each of seven forest areas in northern Sweden. Here we report the initial findings of the experiment that was established in winter 2001-2002 and data were collected in 2002, 2003 and 2006. A pre-inventory of the local species composition in 2002 revealed a higher per area species richness, including red-listed species, in reserves than in managed forests. Ordination analyses of the experimental logs showed a significant effect of area, while not of stand type in 2003. ANOVA analysis showed no significant effect of stand type on species richness and abundance. In 2006, the species assemblage started to differentiate between the two stand types and forest age, forest site type (moisture), and distance to forest reserves, all explained part of the variation, whereas the amount of CWD, and species composition at the start of the experiment only showed a marginal effect.
   The early successional fungal community was dominated by two functional groups, humus-decayers and white-rot species, both characterized by a rapid, early colonization and fruit-body formation on the competition-free new substrate. A similar positive response to the new substrate was also observed for the mycorrhizal species in 2006. The high frequency and early appearance of humus-decayers and mycorrhizal species that do not primarily depend upon CWD for their nutrition suggest that their formation of fruiting bodies is limited by substrate availability. Thus some mycorrhizal fungi are apparently rare due to lack of suitable substrate for fruit-body formation.
   Evidence of dispersal-limitation was observed in 2006. Fomitopsis pinicola, an early colonizer in boreal forests, playing a key role for other wood-inhabiting organisms, colonized significantly more logs in the reserve stands compared with the managed stands. Our data demonstrate that lack of CWD strongly affects both species that depend upon wood for nutrition and species that depend upon wood for fruit-body formation. Thus some species may show an apparent rarity due to lack of suitable substrate. We conclude that creation of CWD appears to be a useful method to maintain or restore fungal diversity in boreal coniferous forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Sweden, rich fens (alkaline fens) have been particularly affected by drainage campaigns for forestry and conversion to agricultural land. Fragmentation of the landscape, invasion of tall vascular plants as well as Polytrichum and Sphagnum mosses and substrate degradation all lead to reduced plant diversity.
   We evaluated the recolonization potential of four characteristic rich fen bryophyte species that use to decrease rapidly after drainage (Scorpidium scorpioides, Scorpidium cossonii, Pseudocalliergon trifarium and Campylium stellatum) by performing transplantation studies with gametophyte fragments in recently hydrologically restored rich fens. In greenhouse and field experiments I cm fragments of all four species had a high survival rate and established well, especially after surface liming of the peat. A protective cover increased the colonization success and the growth potential of the added fragments. Even small alterations of the water level (5 cm) resulted in differences in biomass growth of the fragments of S. cossonii and C. stellatum. Our results show that it is possible to reintroduce bryophyte species lost after drainage using gametophyte fragments as propagules, and that these techniques seem feasible for a number of characteristic rich fen bryophytes. These findings will be of importance when methods for practical restoration of rich fens are developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the international travels of ideas about sustainable urban planning and design through a focus on private sector architecture, planning and engineering consultants. These consultants, who we refer to as the global intelligence corps (GIC), package up their expertise in urban sustainability as a marketable commodity, and apply it on projects around the world. In doing so, the global intelligence corps shape norms about what constitutes good' sustainable urban planning, and contribute to the development of an internationalised travelling model of sustainable urbanism. This article draws on a broad study of the industry (GIC) in sustainable urban planning and design, and two in-depth case studies of Swedish global intelligence corps firms working on Chinese Eco-city projects. Analysis of this material illustrates how the global intelligence corps's work shapes a traveling model of sustainable urbanism, and how this in turn creates and reinforces particular norms in urban planning practice.

AB  - Underground space is a resource for those functions that do not need to be on the surface. From the point of sustainability there are several benefits of locating technical networks in bedrock such as expenses are shared by several users, land is released for other construction purposes, the city's appearance and image are improved as the number of overhead lines can be reduced. The Underground Master Plan of Helsinki shows both existing and future underground spaces and tunnels, as well as existing vital access links to the underground. It has been claimed by some non-Finnish experts that the favourable characteristics of the bedrock and the very severe winter climate conditions have been the main drivers for the underground development. While rock material is one of them, there are other main drivers heading the list over winter, such as the Finnish need to have open spaces even in the city centre. Real estate owners may restrict the use of underground space under their lot or get compensation only if the space to be used is harmful or it causes some loss to the owners. The capital areas of Helsinki and Tallinn have grown enormously during the last 20 years. The 80 kilometre-wide Gulf of Finland separates the cities and restricts the movement of people and goods. A tunnel between Tallinn and Helsinki would be an extension of the Rail Baltica rail link, a project to improve north-south connections between EU Member States. The most up-to-date results for developing coastal areas are about the sea level scenarios. This new data has a lot to do for example with the safe and adequate levels of accesses to underground spaces. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

FX  - The close cooperation that the City of Helsinki has established with the numerous 'partners' involved in planning, financing and designing as well as the actual construction and maintenance of tunnels and underground spaces has perhaps been the most important issue for sustainable underground property development. As much of this work is also carried out unofficially, trust between the parties is central, particularly when developing processes and sharing risks.

AB  - The concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) has broadened the need for data collection in Finland. Comprehensive data collection on forest resources for the National Forest Inventories (NFI) and for forest management planning have been carried out by regional authorities and extension organizations during decades. Specifications for data collection have met the demands of the time, and adjustments have been made according to the changing needs. Traditionally the forest data describes the quantity and quality of timber resources, as well as its production potentials. Other data, especially the indicators that have no direct economic significance, were included in the information databases in the early 1990s. Finland has well-established forestry organizations with long traditions in extension and enforcement work. Finland developed national criteria and indicators for SFM in 1995 based on the proposal for the Pan-European criteria and indicators with data now being collected on the national level. The present challenge in Finland is to streamline the data-collection activities in an efficient way to ensure continuous improvement. Indicators need to describe biodiversity in ecosystems, long-term economic profitability of timber production, non-timber products and other forms of forest use. It must also consider the impacts of AM forest use on employment levels and human well being with consideration given to cultural, recreational and other related aspects.

AB  - A great deal of biodiversity can be found in private forests, and protecting it requires taking into consideration the preferences of key stakeholders. In this study, we examine divergence in stakeholders' preferences for forest attributes across the general public, private non-industrial forest owners and public and private forest officials in Sweden by conducting a discrete choice experiment. Our results indicate that citizens have a positive valuation of biodiversity protection. Moreover, their valuation is statistically significantly higher than those of forest owners. Interestingly, our results suggest that both forest owners and forest officials have a strong orientation towards production, with higher valuation than the general public of the common management practice of even aged stands and clear felling. Even though the Swedish Forestry Act regards production and environmental goals as equally important, we find that forest officials prefer management practices that promote production rather than biodiversity protection.

AB  - Seventy-seven percent of the total water discharge of the 139 largest river systems in North America north of Mexico, in Europe, and in the republics of the former Soviet Union is strongly or moderately affected by fragmentation of the river channels by dams and by water regulation resulting from reservoir operation, interbasin diversion, and irrigation. The remaining free-flowing large river systems are relatively small and nearly all situated in the far north, as are the 59 medium-sized river systems of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. These conditions indicate that many types of river ecosystems have been lost and that the populations of many riverine species have become highly fragmented. To improve the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of biological resources, immediate action is called for to create an international preservation network of free-flowing river systems and to rehabilitate exploited rivers in areas that lack unaffected watercourses.

AB  - Sustainable development of the transport system increasingly requires integration of land-use and transport planning practices. To identify and implement measures that maximize synergies between transport, land-use and environmental issues are essential to achieve sustainable outcomes of transport planning. The strategic choice of measures (SCM) approach, applied in early-stage planning of transport infrastructure projects in Sweden, constitutes a platform for collaboration between transport and land-use authorities for better coordination of the different practices in a specific context. This paper aims to analyze SCM processes from a systems perspective to illuminate consequences of system boundaries on how environmental aspects are considered and what aspects are included or excluded. A case study approach is applied, based on observations and document studies of two cases in Stockholm region. The result shows that coordination of transport and land-use planning practice in the SCM process, implies handling of conflicting views of development in the project area. In order to create shared objectives and visions, constructive dialogue and collaboration are two key features. Moreover, it is a challenge to handle all the different problems and measures in the SCM. It is essential to understand synergies as well as how problems and measures in different planning processes relate to each other. A systems perspective as a support when analyzing problems in an SCM can enable the detection of links between transport, land-use and environmental problems. The systems perspective could contribute to the identification of measures with synergetic effects and subsequently the implementation of multi-functional solutions.

AB  - The exploitation of mineral resources in the resource rich north is high up on the Norwegian political agenda. Northern parts are also the home of the Sami indigenous people using these territories for practicing traditional and modern livelihoods. This holds implications for future sustainable mining as well as indigenous wellbeing.
   This article addresses the role of the Sami indigenous people in the planning processes of new mining developments in the northernmost Norwegian region of Finnmark, and the degree to which different Sami stakeholders can influence these processes.
   Using planning documents and media articles collected during the planning processes of two new mining projects in the region, Nussir and Arctic Gold, the article examines the formal role of the Sami interests in mining licensing processes; the ways in which different Sami stakeholders take part in environmental impact assessment (EIA)-processes; and the extent to which Sami views are taken into account when it comes to important project decisions. The article operates from a local community perspective, applying the concept of social sustainability with theories of indigenous and local community participation in planning processes.

AB  - Sweden is a leading country in governance of property rights, according to global assessments, but Swedish landowners currently argue that their forest property rights are being eroded. Thus, the aim of this article is to investigate when and why the current debate on forest property rights came about, and its resemblance to discussion in an 'echo-chamber'. This refers to an arena in which information is accessed from limited sources and a small number of actors with ideological homogeneity may exert substantial influence and reinforce established opinions. Hence, it may spread disinformation, increase polemic tensions, and hamper deliberative policy processes in society. We assess the resemblance by identifying where the issue is debated in printed news media, the active actors, the interests they represent and how they problematize property rights, i.e. the claims they make and the claims' homogeneity. Our results show that the debate has intensified in recent years, but several issues are not new. The debate is mainly limited to the Swedish rural business press and rural conservative press. Moreover, the main claim-makers are representatives of land and forest owner organizations, and members of agrarian and conservative political parties, which have close organizational and individual connections, thereby forming a metaphorical 'chamber'. The 'echo' consists of repetitive claims about withdrawal and management rights, with no efforts to examine and contextualize complex aspects of private property rights in a changing society. The debate about forest ownership in an echo-chamber is problematic in several ways. It hampers efforts of claim-makers in the chamber to reach out, undermines current systems' legitimacy, and locks important questions about sustainable forestry and property rights into a narrow societal sphere.

AB  - This study investigates the differences in the stand structure of forests on mineral soils between different forest ownership groups in five forestry districts in central Finland. The study area includes the forestry districts of: Keski-Suomi, Pohjois-Karjala, Pohjois-Savo, Etela-Pohjanmaa and Keski-Pohjanmaa. The study is based on the sample plot tree data from the 8th National Forest Inventory of Finland (NFI). The comparisons between the ownership groups were made according to forest site types and stages of stand development. The stand structure variables used were: the range of tree diameter distribution, the number of tree storeys and the number of tree species. The number of tree storeys was estimated from the diameter distribution using non-parametric kernel smoothing.
   The differences between the forest ownership groups were considerable. On moist heaths the forests in private ownership had a greater number of tree storeys and greater diameter range compared to those forests owned by forest industrial companies or by the state. On the dryish and dry heaths similar differences occurred in the number of tree species.
   Information on the state of forests based on large-scale inventory data is a valuable tool for the development of forest management, regional forest management planning and even large-scale ecological planning. In the future, variables, such as those presented and compared in this study, could also be used for monitoring the state of forest management and for forest product certification.

AB  - The primary focus of many in-stream restoration projects is to enhance habitat diversity for salmonid fishes, yet the lack of properly designed monitoring studies, particularly ones with pre-restoration data, limits any attempts to assess whether restoration has succeeded in improving salmonid habitat. Even less is known about the impacts of fisheries-related restoration on other, non-target biota. We examined how restoration aiming at the enhancement of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) affects benthic macroinvertebrates, using two separate data sets: (1) a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design with three years before and three after restoration in differently restored and control reaches of six streams; and (2) a space-time substitution design including channelized, restored, and near-natural streams with an almost 20-year perspective on the recovery of invertebrate communities. In the BACI design, total macroinvertebrate density differed significantly from before to after restoration. Following restoration, densities decreased in all treatments, but less so in the controls than in restored sections. Taxonomic richness also decreased from before to after restoration, but this happened similarly in all treatments. In the long-term comparative study, macroinvertebrate species richness showed no difference between the channel types. Community composition differed significantly between the restored and natural streams, but not between restored and channelized streams. Overall, the in-stream restoration measures used increased stream habitat diversity but did not enhance benthic biodiversity. While many macroinvertebrates may be dispersal limited, our study sites should not have been too distant to reach within almost two decades. A key explanation for the weak responses by macroinvertebrate communities may have been historical. When Fennoscandian streams were channelized for log floating, the loss of habitat heterogeneity was only partial. Therefore, habitat may not have been limiting the macroinvertebrate communities to begin with. Stream restoration to support trout fisheries has strong public acceptance in Finland and will likely continue to increase in the near future. Therefore, more effort should be placed on assessing restoration success from a biodiversity perspective using multiple organism groups in both stream and riparian ecosystems.

AB  - Background: The Nature Step to Respiratory Health was the overarching theme of the 12th General Meeting of the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD) in Helsinki, August 2018. New approaches are needed to improve respiratory health and reduce premature mortality of chronic diseases by 30% till 2030 (UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). Planetary health is defined as the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends. Planetary health and human health are interconnected, and both need to be considered by individuals and governments while addressing several SDGs.
   Results: The concept of the Nature Step has evolved from innovative research indicating, how changed lifestyle in urban surroundings reduces contact with biodiverse environments, impoverishes microbiota, affects immune regulation and increases risk of NCDs. The Nature Step calls for strengthening connections to nature. Physical activity in natural environments should be promoted, use of fresh vegetables, fruits and water increased, and consumption of sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol restricted. Nature relatedness should be part of everyday life and especially emphasized in the care of children and the elderly. Taking "nature" to modern cities in a controlled way is possible but a challenge for urban planning, nature conservation, housing, traffic arrangements, energy production, and importantly for supplying and distributing food. Actions against the well-known respiratory risk factors, air pollution and smoking, should be taken simultaneously.
   Conclusions: In Finland and elsewhere in Europe, successful programmes have been implemented to reduce the burden of respiratory disorders and other NCDs. Unhealthy behaviour can be changed by well-coordinated actions involving all stakeholders. The growing public health concern caused by NCDs in urban surroundings cannot be solved by health care alone; a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.

AB  - We evaluated the long-term implications from modifying rotation lengths in production forests for four forest-reliant species with different habitat requirements. By combining simulations of forest development with habitat models, and accounting both for stand and landscape scale influences, we projected habitat availability over 150 years in a large Swedish landscape, using rotation lengths which are longer (+22% and +50%) and shorter (-22%) compared to current practices. In terms of mean habitat availability through time, species requiring older forest were affected positively by extended rotations, and negatively by shortened rotations. For example, the mean habitat area for the treecreeper Certhia familiaris (a bird preferring forest with larger trees) increased by 31% when rotations were increased by 22%, at a 5% cost to net present value (NPV) and a 7% decrease in harvested volume. Extending rotation lengths by 50% provided more habitat for this species compared to a 22% extension, but at a much higher marginal cost. In contrast, the beetle Hadreule elongatula, which is dependent on sun-exposed dead wood, benefited from shortened rather than prolonged rotations. Due to an uneven distribution of stand-ages within the landscape, the relative amounts of habitat provided by different rotation length scenarios for a given species were not always consistent through time during the simulation period. If implemented as a conservation measure, prolonging rotations will require long-term strategic planning to avoid future bottlenecks in habitat availability, and will need to be accompanied by complementary measures accounting for the diversity of habitats necessary for the conservation of forest biodiversity.

AB  - Farming of Atlantic salmon in exposed areas poses unique challenges to operations, structures and equipment due to severe and irregular wind, wave and current conditions, and sheer remoteness. Many of the operational challenges seen at present sheltered sites are likely to be amplified when moving production to more exposed locations. There is, however, a strong Norwegian industrial interest in utilizing such areas. A new research center, the Exposed Aquaculture Operations center has been initialized to develop competence and technology to address the challenges. Six core research areas are identified that will be crucial to address the challenges with exposed farming, with a focus on the industrial status in Norway. Four areas target technological innovations that will enable safe and reliable exposed aquaculture operations: 1) Autonomous systems and technologies for remote operations, 2) Monitoring and operational decision support, 3) Structures for exposed locations and 4) Vessel design for exposed operations. Two areas represent core requirements for sustainable production: 5) Safety and risk management and 6) Fish behavior and welfare. This paper describes the research needs and the research strategy planned for the Exposed Aquaculture Operations center.

AB  - Norway is an important player in Antarctic governance. As a claimant state with historic whaling interests, it has long held influence in decision-making. Today, Norway lands the largest catch of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) while also leading innovations in sustainable management. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) - a 26-member body (including Norway) which manages marine living resources in the Southern Ocean - has been moving towards adopting a network of marine protected areas (MPAs). Norway has been very influential in this effort - at times supporting and at other times opposing. Here, our research seeks to understand how Norwegian interests in Antarctica - including historic, political and economic - impact the adoption of MPAs. To complete this research, we performed a content analysis of Norwegian government documents and CCAMLR meeting reports combined with interviews with key informants. Norway has shown a complex combination of support and concern, often related to economic interests, the role of science, and Norway's positions in other global realms (e.g., the Arctic). A variety of themes emerged that help describe Norwegian positions and actions in the Southern Ocean MPA process: Norway as a leader in the Antarctic, and in global ocean industries and sustainability; Norway as an active supporter of international cooperation; the importance of science which informs utilisation and protection; and CCAMLR's purpose as a marine living resource management organisation. This research helps provide insight into Norway's positions and into understanding consensus in the CCAMLR MPA process.

AB  - Place-based management is any management action having implications for a specified area. Place-based management is seen as a key component to practical implementation of ecosystem approach to management, with marine spatial planning (MSP) being the currently most promoted approach. In the present paper we address the challenges of place-based management at local, regional and global (oceanic) spatial scales using case studies from the Northeast Atlantic with examples from Norway. Both ecological, governance and management complexity increases with increasing geographic scale, with associated increases in uncertainty and thus increasing need for managing under the precautionary approach. A process where (ecologically) valuable and vulnerable areas are defined early on is essential to successful place-based management under the ecosystem approach. Integrating across sectors and achieving necessary cooperation between involved institutions and stakeholders is also necessary.

AB  - Landscape is a topic of interest for many disciplines, and the importance of considering different approaches that may be complementary has been pointed out by several authors. However, interdisciplinary work applying both cultural and ecological approaches to landscape is challenging. One possible way to deal with these challenges is to study a common interest - an interface. The interface dealt with in this paper is landscape change. In the human-geographical and landscape-ecological literature, three broad perspectives on landscape change are identified. A first perspective deals with "natural" and human factors as causes of change. This perspective is mainly concerned with physical landscape changes. A second perspective concentrates on perception of, attitudes to, and meanings of landscape. The physical landscape plays a certain role, but more focus is placed on its perception. A third perspective focuses on the temporal and/or spatial dimensions of change. When applied to a Norwegian case study; the three perspectives on landscape change help to reveal the high complexity inherent in landscape change. Knowledge of this complexity can support conscious decisions about future development and a weighting of the consequences of different management alternatives.

AB  - We investigated the role of matrix type as a determinant of change in bird densities with forest patch area (patch area effect) in two different Fennoscandian landscape types: mature forest fragments surrounded by cut-over or regenerating forest and true forested islands surrounded by water. Since the matrix of forested archipelagoes offers no resources to and impedes movement of forest birds, we predict that patch area effects on bird densities should be stronger on forested islands than in forest patches fragmented by forestry. We compiled correlation estimates of the bird density-patch area relationship from the literature and analyzed the data using meta-analysis. Combined correlation coefficients were significantly positive on islands but were not significantly different from 0 in fragments. Within-species comparisons also showed that correlations were consistently more positive on islands than in fragments. On islands but not in fragments, the densities of forest specialist species were more sensitive to area than were the densities of forest generalists, suggesting that specialists are more sensitive to changes in matrix quality. Migration status was only weakly associated with bird responses to island or fragment area. Thus, forest fragments do not function as true islands. We interpret this as the result of compensatory effects of the surrounding matrix in terms of availability of resources and enhanced connectivity (matrix quality hypothesis). A purely patch-centered approach seems an unrealistic framework to analyze population processes occurring in complex landscapes. The characteristics of the habitat matrix should therefore be explicitly incorporated into the assessment of species' responses to habitat fragmentation.

AB  - The study examines how a Sweden Finnish minority language activist group positions themselves by inserting graffiti-like stickers into the Swedish Linguistic Landscape, and how the majority populations in Sweden and Finland react to these revitalisation efforts. Protesting by placing stickers in physical environments is classified as an act of linguistic citizenship (Isin 2009) and, from the majority's point of view, these acts are a threat to the shared cultural moral order. The data consists of pictures posted on Instagram that depict actual physical environments where activists have placed stickers that encourage the minority to "speak their own language". The activists utilise temporal, spatial, textual, and multimodal elements in their discursive construction. As a theoretical framework, I apply Harre and Langehove's (1991) positioning theory. The results show how minorities position themselves in relation to the Swedish majority population with the aim of justifying their status and their right to exist.

AB  - In European countries, the coasts are areas with high population density, intensive use of marine and terrestrial resources, and rapid urbanization. Coastal development creates conflicts and further ones are expected through climate change and sea level rise. In this article, the aim is knowledge synthesis for conflict research to support strategies for sustainable coastal zone management. For that purpose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework is elaborated and applied in exemplary conflict analyses. The framework combines knowledge from different fields of environmental and conflict research. In an analysis of 26 local, non-violent resource use conflicts in the Swedish metropolitan coastal areas of Gothenburg and Malmo, the themes of coastal landscape changes, resource management, and conflict analysis are connected in a governance perspective. The data were collected through qualitative, semi-structured interviews and discussions with local stakeholders and experts, document analysis and analysis of articles from local newspapers. The conflict analysis showed the multi-faceted and complex nature of the conflicts. Solutions require interdisciplinary research and knowledge synthesis. Our conclusions relate to the requirements of further development of knowledge integration and approaches to multi-scale environmental governance.

AB  - This paper evaluates performance of fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data in several land cover mapping studies in the boreal forest environment, taking advantage of the high canopy penetration capability at L-band. The studies included multiclass land cover mapping, forest-nonforest delineation, and classification of soil type under vegetation. PolSAR data used in the study were collected by the ALOS PALSAR sensor in 2006-2007 over a managed boreal forest site in Finland. A supervised classification approach using selected polarimetric features in the framework of probabilistic neural network (PNN) was adopted in the study. It has no assumptions about statistics of the polarimetric features, using nonparametric estimation of probability distribution functions instead. The PNN-based method improved classification accuracy compared with standard maximum-likelihood approach. The improvement was considerably strong for soil type mapping under vegetation, indicating notable non-Gaussian effects in the PolSAR data even at L-band. The classification performance was strongly dependent on seasonal conditions. The PolSAR feature data set was further modified to include a number of recently proposed polarimetric parameters (surface scattering fraction and scattering diversity), reducing the computational complexity at practically no loss in the classification accuracy. The best obtained accuracies of up to 82.6% in five-class land cover mapping and more than 90% in forest-nonforest mapping in wall-to-wall validation indicate suitability of PolSAR data for wide-area land cover and forest mapping.

AB  - The article deals with the environmental consciousness emerged from the 1970's onwards, and with subsequent change in the ideology of city planning. The focus is on the development of urban conservation methods and on the maintenance of the built environment, which have marked a decisive shift away from the CIAM theses that dominated urban thinking during half-a-century. The decision to take the existing built environment as the starting point for all to actions of city planning and design has been a radical stand for a new approach, corresponding to and paralleling E the idea of sustainable development that crystallized in the 1980's up to the 1992 UN Conference. Grassroots-level strategies are considered important for all actions towards a sustainable way of life. The case of Finland is studied in some detail, with the conservation atlas of the historic milieu as an example of teaching a sustainable approach to environmental planning and design.

AB  - Lawns have a significant influence on the cityscape as one of the essential elements of green spaces and an important part of people's everyday lives. Most people in the Western world view lawns as a compulsory element of the urban landscape, almost an icon, without questioning their social, symbolic, ecological or aesthetic values. This research is a part of the conceptual framework and methodological approaches that are being used in an ongoing transdisciplinary collaboration project to study lawns in Sweden as a social and ecological phenomenon.
   The overall aim of this study was to investigate social and cultural perceptions of lawns, as well as motives behind decisions about the establishment and management of lawns in Sweden. Two multifamily housing typologies, the 'Million Programme' and People's Homes', were examined due to their dominance in Swedish cities. We also studied how an alternative vision of conventional lawns can be applied and accepted by urban residents. We estimated lawn cover in multi-family housing areas and links to people's perception and use of lawns. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and observational studies were used (N = 300). Our results showed that people like lawns even if they do not always directly use them. Lawns cover the most significant amount of outdoor spaces in all multi-family residential areas and accompany people everywhere from the house to the schoolyard or park. The total lawn cover in the study areas was 27.8%. Lawns were particularly valued as important places for different outdoor activities (playing, resting, picnicking, walking, socialising) and enjoying the green colour. However people do not want to use a vast monotonous lawn, but a variety of spaces that provide good conditions for different senses ( sound, smell, touch and sight) and activities. Alternative lawns were also appreciated by many citizens, politicians, planners and managers. The implementation of new types of lawns requires special planning and design solutions adjusted for each particular neighbourhood. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Tourism demand within peripheral regions reflects visitor motivations to seek experiences constrained by attributes that involve the abilities of these visitors. Often, the basis of tourism supply is driven by accessible publicly-owned common-pool resources that exist as regional economic assets yet are unpriced in the marketplace. Free-riding prevails as rent-seeking firms utilize non-marketed natural and cultural assets in their production practices. The work reported here develops concepts that illustrate keys to successful cultural tourism entrepreneurship using a case study of a festival on the Norwegian coast that features the treasured literary works of Olav Duun. Results suggest that public-private partnerships can be used to stimulate entrepreneurial activity. Further, success is a function of managerial expertise in attaining visitor experience that falls within the flow channel.

AB  - The impacts of political decisions concerning land use constraints on potential raw material procurement of the saw mill industry in different operational environments were analysed in a case study at regional and municipal levels. In these analyses, qualitative scenarios about the future operational environment of the sawmill industry were integrated with quantitative and exploratory scenario modelling. First, existing qualitative scenarios and statistical data were utilized in the quantitative parameterization of the Finnish resource projection model, MELA. Thereafter, MELA was used for decision support for determining land use policy impacts. According to the MELA scenarios, the impact of existing administrative land use constraints on potential saw log removal was small at the regional level. However, at the municipal scale the impacts varied. The severity of the impacts depended on the targets set for the utilization of forest resources, proportion of areas having land use constraints from the total forest area, age and volume structure of the forests at the municipal level and length of planning period. Our experiment shows that MELA is applicable as a decision support system in forest land use planning. Further development is, however, needed to facilitate searching for land use regulation measures that minimize the negative effects of land use decisions on wood supply and to consider the importance of different sources of uncertainty.

AB  - An application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented for taking public preferences into account in choosing the management strategy for a forest area. An illustrative example of the use of the approach is given, and some experiences in practical planning at Ruunaa conservation area in Eastern Finland are discussed. The approach can be applied to representative, as well as to participatory democracy approaches. The use of the approach is mainly discussed with regard to representative democracy. In the representative approach, a level of players consisting of interest groups is added into the decision hierarchy, just above the level of decision objectives. In the participatory approach, the level of players consists of citizens. By applying the approach, valuable information can be obtained about public values and their effects on the choice of management strategy as well as about possibilities to attain a compromise between conflicting interests.

AB  - This study investigates how and by whom the Swedish (forest) bioeconomy has been shaped so far. We unpack emerging bioeconomies as discursive constructs and use the 'apparatus of capture' as a conceptual framework to understand and rethink the Swedish bioeconomy. Based on analysis of empirical data from multiple sources (e.g., online surveys, in-depth interviews, participatory observations), we identify a closed bioeconomy network structure that includes forest industries, major forest owner associations, regional councils and research institutes/universities. The network (re)produces three key storylines that appeal to the majority of parties in the national parliament, defines the boundaries of relevant expertise, and discredits environmental regulation and expertise. Through these storylines the Swedish bioeconomy is turned into an issue of innovation governance, which blurs the boundaries between public and private interests in forests. To counteract future capture, different types of knowledges and forest perspectives need further exploration in Swedish bioeconomy and forest governance.

AB  - Adaptive management models are designed to include a variety of stakeholders, but they may still exclude significant groups. Drawing on two Norwegian studies of conflicts over large carnivores, one such group is identified as working-class men with strong ties to local hunting and "outdoorsman'' culture. For them, the carnivore controversies are part of a conflict between dominant and subordinate cultural forms and bodies of knowledge. Representing dominant culture and hegemonic knowledge, managers and scientists have a hard time establishing rapport with anticarnivore hardliners. It is suggested that joint practical work may diminish some cultural barriers, and a project where this has been crucial is described. The lynx registration program in southeastern Norway brings together biologists, managers, and local hunters in practical field work in order to make population estimates. Although motivated by a demand for "exact numbers,'' this project apparently has succeeded in narrowing some cultural gaps as well.

AB  - It has been recently argued that the vast resources of established firms can potentially accelerate sustainability transitions. This paper contributes to the study of such possibilities by investigating the resource redeployment of three Norwegian oil and gas industry firms in corporate ventures in floating wind power technologies. Using interview and document data, the findings show that the opportunity to use existing firm resources was a key motivation for established firms to engage in entrepreneurship in such technologies. The firms could redeploy their specialised and general-purpose resources in these entrepreneurial ventures, and develop new technologies on the basis of their existing resources. However, also challenges and controversies were observed. This paper thus suggests that the process of resource redeployment can help to explain why, and describe how, established firms may engage in cleantech innovation through corporate entrepreneurship.

AB  - This article presents an investigation of how developers in Oslo, Norway, relate to and deal with negative covenants in densification projects. A densification project which is permissible under the zoning system and public-law provisions might simultaneously be in breach of the covenant system and private-law rules. As long as a negative covenant is not annulled in the event of a conflict between the covenant and project plan, it can prevent publicly approved development projects from going ahead. The challenges associated with negative covenants and zoning plans, and thus the implementation of housing and densification policies, have been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions, concluding that the implementation of a zoning plan does not overrule negative covenants inconsistent with the public regulations. The article's most important finding is that the Norwegian system for dealing with covenants is costly in terms of time and resources, and creates unpredictability for rights holders and developers alike due to the risk of covenants being enforced. The biggest challenge is having two different systems working more or less independently of one another.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine, and tentatively explain, how genetic biodiversity is handled in the management of Baltic Sea Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Genetic biodiversity is critical for species' adaptation to changing environmental conditions and is protected by international agreements. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that genetic biodiversity is neglected in marine environments and in the management of MPAs. This study focuses on Sweden and Finland, which together govern a substantial part of Baltic Sea MPAs, and builds on in-depth interviews with regional conservation managers that are responsible for establishing and managing these areas. The empirical findings confirm that genetic biodiversity is absent, or plays a minor role, in contemporary MPA management. The findings also provide several possible explanations to this situation: unclear understandings of formal policy, lack of resources, deficient knowledge base, and the managers' own policy beliefs. Policy makers and high-level managers need to consider these aspects in their efforts to protect biodiversity.

AB  - The transport of goods, equipment and waste to, from, in and through urban areas (urban logistics) are essential for the economic vitality of the city but at the same time make urban environmental and social targets more difficult to achieve The European Green Deal and the UN Sustainability Goals also challenge the ways of addressing planning and management. At the same time Covid 19 has led to new challenges for urban logistics together with changes in consumer purchasing and travel patterns. Digitalisation offers new ways of collecting data and providing input to planning and modelling of urban logistics that might alleviate these challenges. This article addresses how digitalisation and especially sensors can contribute to new forms of data for analysis and play a role in developing sustainable digital urban logistics measures and plans through data collection and sharing. The research contains empirical insights from a survey and workshop in Norway. The results from the survey show that sensors are the digital solution that practitioners see as most useful for urban transport. This is supported by results from the workshop supporting a sensor scenario. When it comes to the digitalisation process, the practitioners expect that the different levels of government will facilitate digitalisation of urban logistics and most practitioners have the opinion that all levels of government should do more to facilitate new solutions Testing should take place as collaboration between private and public actors. Due to Covid 19 the government level is seen to have an important role for exchange of information and advice, and for giving economic incentives and support, rather than providing law and regulatory changes or the reorganisation of public services. The local level is considered to have an especially important role for digitalisation including data for modelling, planning or public procurement procedures. The article addresses these questions by reference to the partnerships for freight transport in London and Gothenburg. This article adds insights for planning practitioners into how sensors will challenge as well as provide new possibilities, to suggest new paths for planning and modelling urban logistics and an amplified role for freight partnerships.

AB  - We analyzed forest landscape changes in a western Finnish breeding area of Siberian jays utilizing Landsat MSS and TM satellite images taken during a 29-year period (1976-2005). We found that Siberian jays appeared to favour closed spruce-dominated forest patches, possibly because they provide better visual protection against predators. Such spruce-dominated forest patches became smaller and increasingly fragmented during the study period. According to a 25-m pixel analysis, the total area of spruce-dominated habitats decreased from 14.7% to 11.0% and the mean patch size from 2.0 ha to 1.4 ha during 1987-2005. This was mainly due to intense loggings of spruce forests and a special form of land ownership, which has induced narrow forest estates measuring few dozens of metres in width. The parallel decline in potential breeding habitats as well as Siberian jay population size suggests that loss and fragmentation of key habitats, and possibly related changes in predator community, are the most probable causes for the decline of Siberian jay population in the study area.

AB  - I examine the relationship between nested distributional patterns and the degree to which several small reserves will contain more species than would a single reserve of equal total area (SLOSS). Nestedness is a common property of species distributions on real and habitat islands. However, there is considerable variation in nestedness among species distributions, some of which is related to the physical and biological background of the archipelagoes. Nestedness does not vary according to the taxonomic group examined (with the exception of aquatic invertebrates). Nestedness does vary between real and habitat islands (with aquatic invertebrates excluded), but not between oceanic and land-bridge islands. The more a biota is nested, the more likely it is that a single large reserve would preserve more species. However, nestedness is a rather poor predictor of SLOSS, as the vast majority of archipelagoes support a strategy of several small reserves, even though almost all of them are significantly nested. Nestedness says little about optimal reserve design and management, and appears to be a weak conservation tool.

AB  - We studied the patterns of habitat availability and use by the Cantabrian capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus, an isolated and endangered population at the southwestern edge of the species distribution. We combined field surveys and GIS analyses to show that this population differs from its conifer-specialist conspecifics in that it inhabits beech Fagus sylvatica and oak Quercus petraea forests, without specialisation as regards the tree species as long as enough forest cover remains. The habitat of Cantabrian capercaillie is highly fragmented, and smaller forest patches have been abandoned during the last few decades; the display areas that remain occupied are now located farther from forest edges. Lower tree density and more widespread distribution of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus characterised the occupied display grounds. However, even abandoned areas showed tree densities well within the optimum range for capercaillie and bilberry in other populations, a result that should be taken into account before any habitat management action is considered. We found that some non-forested habitats were also used by capercaillie, especially during the autumn and winter. We suggest that the protection of Cantabrian capercaillie should be tightly coupled with an effective, strict protection of the few remaining large forest fragments in the range, and that information about nesting and brood rearing habitat should be obtained. Conditions for understory development should be favoured, preventing overgrazing by ungulates. The natural, non-forested matrix should also be considered in management plans, as a direct source of food and shelter and an important feature determining connectivity among patches.

AB  - Increased protection of forest biodiversity implies reduced income from timber production both for society and forest owners, and consistent analysis of the relationships between biodiversity benefits and corresponding costs is important both for forest managers as well as policy makers. Using a complex dynamic forest optimization model, we analyse impacts on economy and biodiversity of forest management restrictions implemented to protect biodiversity. A reference scenario is compared to two preservation regimes based on 1) the current Norwegian forest certification system and 2) an expert judgement designed to put strong emphasis on biodiversity protection in boreal forests. Economic impacts are expressed as net present value and harvesting level, while impacts on forest structure are expressed by a vector of variables including old forest proportions, growing stock, number of retention trees, size of buffer zones and amount of dead wood. A rather detailed description of forest structure and biodiversity measures represents the main improvements compared to previous analyses. Different restrictions result in 10-45% decrease in economic value of the forest compared to no restrictions. The most costly measures are found to be 50% increased rotation and keeping old-growth proportions higher than 20%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the land use history has proven crucial for the conservation of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. In southern Sweden, very small and fragmented areas of the disturbance-dependent habitat xeric sand calcareous grassland support a large number of threatened and rare plants and animals. In order to find out if historical land use could explain variation in present-day habitat quality, the land use on eight such sites was traced back to the 18th century and compared with key factors such as the amount of bare sand, lime content and P availability. There was no support for the common explanation of the decline in xeric sand calcareous grassland being caused by abandonment of agricultural fields during the last century. Instead, fertilization history was the main explanation for the difference in depletion depth of CaCO3 seen between the sites. The decline in xeric sand calcareous grassland since the 18th century is most probably the result of the drastic changes in land use during the 19th century, which put an end to the extensive sand drift. Since cultivation was shown to have played an important role in the historical land use of xeric sand calcareous grassland, grazing alone may not be the optimal management option for these grasslands. Instead more drastic measures are needed to restore the high calcium content and maintain proper disturbance levels.

AB  - Changes in river flow may appear from shifts in land cover, constructions in the river channel, and climatic change, but currently there is a lack of understanding of the relative importance of these drivers. Therefore, we collected gauged river flow time series from 1961 to 2018 from across Sweden for 34 disturbed catchments to quantify how the various types of disturbances have affected river flow. We used trend analysis and the differences in observations versus hydrological modeling to explore the effects on river flow from (1) land cover changes from wildfires, storms, and urbanization; (2) dam constructions with regulations for hydropower production; and (3) climate-change impact in otherwise undisturbed catchments. A mini model ensemble, consisting of three versions of the S-HYPE model, was used, and the three models gave similar results. We searched for changes in annual and daily stream flow, seasonal flow regime, and flow duration curves. The results show that regulation of river flow has the largest impact, reducing spring floods with up to 100% and increasing winter flow by several orders of magnitude, with substantial effects transmitted far downstream. Climate changed the total river flow up to 20%. Tree removal by wildfires and storms has minor impacts at medium and large scales. Urbanization, on the contrary, showed a 20% increase in high flows also at medium scales. This study emphasizes the benefits of combining observed time series with numerical modeling to exclude the effect of varying weather conditions, when quantifying the effects of various drivers on long-term streamflow shifts.

AB  - To safeguard overall sustainability in forest resource management, the ecological, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of sustainability should all be considered. However, the socio-cultural impacts are frequently contemplated only weakly in sustainability assessments. Hitherto, attempts to operationalize socio-cultural impacts arising from economic utilization or conservation of forest resources have been perceived as vague when compared to rigorous ecological and economic indicators. One reason is that socio-cultural impacts of forest management on individuals and communities are many and by nature context- and case-specific: they need local definition, which hampers diffusion of good solutions. This study developed a multi-criteria method for measuring and monitoring socio-cultural impacts of forest resource management; the case of cooperation network projects within Forest Biodiversity Programme for Southern Finland (METSO) provided empirical data. Based on a literature review, a set of 10 criteria and 25 indicators was compiled. Cumulative utility scores, presenting networks' contributions to socio-cultural sustainability, were generated using performance, expert evaluation and weighting data and an additive utility model. The method enables longitudinal monitoring of socio-cultural impacts, which is beneficial because outcomes are different at different time points of projects' life cycles and some appear with a delay. The method can be used in comparing sub-utility distributions i.e. monitoring units' performance profiles, providing valuable information for policy-makers. The multi-criteria approach and the list of socio-cultural criteria are internationally transferable to other countries and contexts such as forest bioenergy, nature tourism, watershed management, that call for analysing socio-cultural impacts of forest resource management activity on private lands.

AB  - 1. European hares Lepus europaeus have declined throughout Europe since the 1960s. Possible reasons for this include agricultural intensification and changes in climate and predator numbers, but no clear consensus has been reached as to the relative importance of each of these. We aimed to identify factors associated with high and low hare numbers throughout Europe, to determine which could have caused population declines.
   2. Results of 77 research papers from 12 European countries were summarized. Relationships between hare density and demographics and habitat, climate, hunting and predator variables were examined and quantified where possible. Temporal changes in factors identified as being associated with high or low numbers of hares were then examined to see if they could explain population declines.
   3. Data from pastural habitats were limited, but densities of hares were low. Arable habitats had higher densities than mixed areas in spring, unless farming was intensive in which case densities were similar. In autumn the two habitats had similar densities. Field size, temperature, precipitation and hunting had no effect on density throughout Europe. Fecundity was affected by climate.
   4. Arable land, various crops, fallow habitat and temperature were positively associated, and monoculture, precipitation and predators negatively associated with hare abundance. The relationship of field size, pasture and woodland with abundance depended on spatial scale.
   5. Habitat changes caused by agricultural intensification are the ultimate cause of hare population declines. Effects of changes in climate or predator numbers are magnified by the loss of high-quality year-round forage and cover. Further research is required on how habitat changes affect fecundity and survival, and to identify which parameters have the greatest impact on population numbers. Farmland management policies that target the re-establishment of some of the habitat diversity lost within fields, farms and landscapes will help to reverse the decline of the European hare.

AB  - Past landscape characteristics were reconstructed in Nynas, south-eastern Sweden, using geographical and archaeological data together with pollen stratigraphy and an existing shore displacement model, with the aim to explore the development of semi-natural grasslands in the area. A 2.3 m peat core was analysed and radiocarbon dated at three levels. The pollen stratigraphy was estimated to start at approximately 3800 C-14 years before present (BP), at the end of Late Neolithic. Human activities are evident, from both archaeological findings and pollen analysis, for more than 4000 years. Grazing is apparent, possibly more intense around 3200 C-14 years BP, 2500-2600 C-14 years BP, 2100-2200 C-14 years BP, and 1300/1400 C-14 years BP to present day. From 1900+/-80 C-14 years BP and onwards cultivation is intensified at the same time as spruce (Picea abies) expands. Maps on land-cover distribution in the late 17th century was used as a model for the utilisation of the landscape during the Iron Age. Land-covers on very thin soils were grazed and sometimes mown within the village boundaries, but they were also used for cultivation in narrow strips where bedrock is adjacent to clays. Till and varved glacial clays would have been used for cultivation. A reasonable estimation is that 10% of the study area could have been used for cultivation 1900 C-14 years BP, compared to 28% in the end of the 17th century. During the last century there has been a shift towards more arable fields and more forestry. There are 10% open or semi-open grassland left today, and 6% wooded grassland, compared with 47% open or semi-open grassland in the 17th century. Little more than half of the open grasslands are managed today, all by grazing. It is argued that encroachment of trees and shrubs on open or semi-open grasslands will not only reduce species richness in the landscape but also threaten parts of our cultural heritage.

AB  - Increasing use of ocean space, through land or sea industries, has over time caused aggregated ecological problems as well as state jurisdictional issues thus leading to the development of regimes for regulating and reversing such effects and disputes. In this context, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) constitutes a fundamental instrument for the governance of the marine environment and its resources. Currently, the urgent need to resolve depletion of ocean resources has led us to gradually include the principles of sustainable development in the ocean governance spectrum. Amid growing international efforts to preserve oceans, the United Nations (UNs) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced a new form of ocean governance by integrating seasonable sustainability perspectives to the hitherto established ocean governance status quo. This paper aims to explore Norway's ocean governance regime contributing thus to the discourse of country's transition and shaping to address latest sustainability challenges. To do so, a socio-legal scholarship is adopted. Drawing on hypotheses from extensive review and contextual analysis by a total of 158 Norwegian government sources and literature, the article identified significant adjustments to the Norwegian ocean governance model, as well as weaknesses that need further intervention.

AB  - The Great Crested Newt (Triturus cristatus) is considered threatened throughout Europe; consequently, the species and its breeding habitat are protected in many countries. Translocation of a population is a conservation tool used when habitat occupied by a species is scheduled to be destroyed by human development. The outcome of these translocations is rarely monitored. This study describes and discusses a translocation of T. cristatus in south-central Sweden (Orebro), which occurred because of planned destruction of breeding habitat associated with development of a shopping and industrial area. We provide quantitative data concerning numbers of relocated amphibians and subsequent monitoring in both the pond being destroyed, which is serving as the source of newts to be translocated, and the pond that received the translocated newts. The translocation exemplifies how difficult it is to determine size and conservation value of a population without thorough initial investigations. A large part of the translocated population seemed to disappear at the receiving area, which initially indicated that the translocation was ineffective. Nevertheless, longer term monitoring indicated that a population was established and reproduced in the new habitat. We argue that translocation should never be a first choice to make human development possible but one should always strive for preservation of an existing habitat. However, if a translocation is unavoidable, an appriopriate assessment of the affected population should be performed and a detailed analysis of habitats in the potential receiving areas should be carried out to select an area best fitted for the species in question.

AB  - Climate and land-use change are recognised as the two main drivers of the ongoing reorganisation of Earth's biodiversity, but understanding precisely their role in shaping species' distributions and communities remains challenging. In mountainous regions, we typically observe an uphill shift of species' altitudinal ranges caused by increasing temperatures, but it is difficult to predict how this process interacts with land-use change. Here, we replicated an inventory of bumblebees that took place in the 1960s in Norway. Focusing on subalpine areas, we reported changes in species richness and community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, at low and high altitude. Using aerial photographs and meteorological data, we tested the relationship between climate and land-cover changes and changes in species richness and CTI. We observed an overall increase in CTI consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. There was on average an increase in species richness at high altitudes, while low-altitudes communities tendedto become less species-rich. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between species richness and temperature and precipitation trends, suggesting a detrimental effect of climate change. Thanks to the replication of an historical inventory, we were able to show evidence for an effect of climate, and possibly land-cover, change on subalpine bumblebee assemblages. These results can contribute to a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity changes in subalpine areas in a context of global climate and landscape changes.

AB  - In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament adopted a plan for brown bear Ursus arctos management. The main goal of the plan was two-fold: (1) ensure viable bear populations within five core areas along the border of neighbouring countries; and (2) limit the damage caused by bear on sheep Ovis aries grazing on open rangeland which has increased over the last few years. In this study we have examined the possibility of attaining both these political aims. Sheep losses in title study areas within bear core areas rose considerably during the period 1981-1993, when the Scandinavian bear population increased by 1.5% a year. We found a significant correlation between the estimated number of bears and the loss of grazing ewes in both areas. No such relationship was found in the control areas (considered to be without bears) adjacent to the study area. We found no relationship between number of ew:es lost and number of ewes grazing. Shooting of bears that presumably killed sheep had no effect on the number of ewes lost during the following season, probably because the number of bears killed in Norway was less than the number of bears immigrating from Sweden. Killing more bears is not compatible with the political aims of the management plan. It is difficult to reach all the political goals under the current situation. The loss of sheep will probably continue to increase unless changes are made in sheep husbandry methods in the core areas. Alternatively, sheep must be moved out of the areas set aside for the re-establishment of bears. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Like innumerable areas worldwide, northern and Arctic areas are experiencing rapid urbanization. The land is often publicly owned in the main, and there are many interests focusing on the same areas. Different activities lead to specific challenges in land use management in regard to public participation. There are guidelines and legal norms for participation in Finland from the municipality to the ministry level, but the style and rate of participation vary a lot from city to city. In this article the potential of public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) is examined in the Arctic city, Rovaniemi. The research questions are: How has participation in land use planning and decision-making been implemented in the context of sparsely populated Arctic city the past and present times? How do the interviewees see the potential of the use of PPGIS? Attitudes towards PPGIS were positive, but the implementation of all types of participation data, such as PPGIS data, was seen as vague and weak. Challenges of the participation were associated with poor communication, insufficient information, and lack of trust. Nature values and local opinions were considered to be at risk of being overshadowed by economic values.

AB  - Most humans now live in cities and their main experience of nature is through urban greenery. An increasing number of studies show the importance of urban green spaces for wellbeing, although most of them are based on visual perception. A questionnaire examining people's evaluations of natural sounds was answered by 1326 individuals living near one of six urban green areas of varying naturalness in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. Women and the elderly reported greater calmness when hearing bird song and rustling leaves (and placed a higher importance on the richness of bird species) than did men, younger and middle-aged individuals. Independent of age and gender, urban woodlands (high naturalness) had higher evaluations than parks (low naturalness). Our results suggest that to increase positive experiences of urban green areas, demographic variables of gender and age should be taken into account, and settings that mimic nature should be prioritized in planning.

AB  - To ensure successful conservation of ecological and cultural landscape values, detailed and up-to-date spatial information of existing habitatpatterns is essential. However, traditional satellite-based and raster classifications rely on pixels that are assigned to a single category and often generalized. For many fragmented key habitats, such a strategy is too coarse and complementary data is needed. In this paper, we aim at detecting pixel-wise fractional coverage of broadleaved woodland and grassland components in a hemiboreal landscape. This approach targets ecologically relevant deciduous fractions and complements traditional crisp land cover classifications. We modeled fractional components using a k-NN approach, which was based on multispectral satellite data, assisted by a digital elevation model and a contemporary map database. The modeled components were then analyzed based on landscape structure indicators, and evaluated in conjunction with CORINE classification. The results indicate that both broadleaved forest and grassland components are widely distributed in the study area, principally organized as transition zones and small patches. Landscape structure indicators show a substantial variation based on the fractional threshold, pinpointing their dependency on the classification scheme and grain. The modeled components, on the other hand, suggest high internal variation for most CORINE classes, indicating their heterogeneous appearance and showing that the presence of deciduous components in the landscape are not properly captured in a coarse land cover classification. To gain a realistic perception of the landscape, and use this information for the needs of spatial planning, both fractional results and existing land cover classifications are needed. This is because they mutually contribute to an improved understanding of habitat patterns and structures, and should be used to complement each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Behaviour of people, who consume non-timber forest goods, is an understudied link between sustainable forestry and cultural tradition. We explored relationships between natural bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) supply and its consumption in Estonia. Based on 53 semi-structured interviews with regular berry-pickers, we modelled their picking site preferences at the landscape scale. The analysis confirmed that those people use clearly delineated picking areas, which constitute a subset of bilberry-rich habitats and are perceived as relatively private information, shared with few people (notably along family lines). Clear-cutting was a major disturbance (60% of respondents had the experience of site loss), while bilberry spread in regenerating forests or after drainage was hardly noticed. Berry-pickers preferred public forests, but had no preference for protected areas. These patterns distinguish spatial modelling of continuous-cover forestry and gap-felling systems in public forests as a basic approach for sustaining national bilberry-gathering tradition.

AB  - 1. The effects of human-caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox Vulpes vulpes L. and pine marten Martes martes L. were studied by combining the Finnish wildlife-triangle snow-track data (1990-94) with land-use and forest resources data employing the GIS. Two study areas (each 45 000 km(2)) located in northern and southern Finland were selected for the investigation.
   2. The extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance (tracks per 10 km 24 h(-1)) was the same (about 100 km(2)) in both species and study areas.
   3. The decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox. The relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance, however, was characterized by a convex curve peaking at 20-30% of agricultural land. With the habitat classification used, landscape composition explained 26% and 11% of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively.
   4. The relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox. Landscape composition explained 10% and 6% of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. In both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape, but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant.
   5. The abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated, indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale.
   6. A general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years. We conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities, but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker.

AB  - Parks and other green spaces are an important part of sustainable, healthy and socially equal urban environment. Urban planning and green space management benefit from information about green space use and values, but such data are often scarce and laborious to collect. Temporally dynamic geographic information generated by different mobile devices and social media platforms are a promising source of data for studying green spaces. User-generated data have, however, platform specific characteristics that limit their potential use. In this article, we compare the ability of different user-generated data sets to provide information on where, when and how people use and value urban green spaces. We compare four types of data: social media, sports tracking, mobile phone operator and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) data in a case study from Helsinki, Finland. Our results show that user-generated geographic information sources provide useful insights about being in, moving through and perceiving urban green spaces, as long as evident limitations and sample biases are acknowledged. Social media data highlight patterns of leisure time activities and allow further content analysis. Sports tracking data and mobile phone data capture green space use at different times of the day, including commuting through the parks. PPGIS studies allow asking specific questions from active participants, but might be limited in spatial and temporal extent. Combining information from multiple user-generated data sets complements traditional data sources and provides a more comprehensive understanding of green space use and preferences.

AB  - Much feminist rural geography to date has centred on understanding gender issues in rural space. Norwegian scholars have been leading the way in identifying new themes and approaches to examining the positions of women and men on farms and in farming communities, which has contributed to important contextual knowledge of gender relations on Norwegian farms, as well as conceptual understandings of farming lives more broadly. The article has the same objective. The authors review the extensive body of literature and identify themes, trajectories, approaches, and concepts used since the 1990s. They find that there were three main periods: 1990s to 1997, with early work that sought to describe gender roles; 1994-2005, when constructivist approaches were used; and the mid-2000s onwards, when researchers 'branched out' to study more specific themes. To encourage a widening of feminist perspectives in Norwegian farming and forestry, the authors suggest taking up (1) an intersectional approach in attending to gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and ability, (2) a decolonial approach, and (3) a focus on the 'green transition'. They conclude that, together, these could help to address pressing issues relating to equity, sustainability, and the future of agriculture and forestry in Norwegian contexts.

AB  - Dead wood is a critical resource for forest biodiversity and widely used as an indicator for sustainable forest management. Based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory we provide baseline information and analyze trends in volume and distribution of dead wood in Swedish managed forests during 15 years. The data are based on approximate to 30,000 sample plots inventoried during three periods (1994-1998; 2003-2007 and 2008-2012). The forest policy has since 1994 emphasized the need to increase the amount of dead wood in Swedish forests. The average volume of dead wood in Sweden has increased by 25% (from 6.1 to 7.6 m(3) ha(-1)) since the mid-1990s, but patterns differed among regions and tree species. The volume of conifer dead wood (mainly from Picea abies) has increased in the southern part of the country, but remained stable or decreased in the northern part. Heterogeneity of dead wood types was low in terms of species, diameter and decay classes, potentially negatively impacting on biodiversity. Overall, we found only minor effects of the current forest policy since most of the increase can be attributed to storm events creating a pulse of hard dead wood. Therefore, the implementation of established policy instruments (e.g. legislation and voluntary certification schemes) need to be revisited. In addition to the retention of dead trees during forestry operations, policy makers should consider calling for more large-scale targeted creation of dead trees and management methods with longer rotation cycles.

AB  - Since the beginning of the twentieth century, forest regeneration management and policy in the Nordic-Baltic region (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) have gone through significant changes. For decades forest as a key natural resource was managed with main focus on timber production. However, several factors influenced shifting forest management, including forest regeneration to meet a wide range of society needs. This review study aims to reveal the historical development of forest regeneration identifying knowledge gaps and supporting decisions that promote sustainable regeneration of future forests. The development of forest regeneration management and policy in the Nordic-Baltic countries is analyzed through reforestation and afforestation practices as well as legislation aspects using a narrative review approach. Trends in forest regeneration practices within the region are identified and explored over a timeframe spanning from 1900 until today. Despite diverse forestry management structures and differing political, social situations, the study shows that forest regeneration development has followed similar patterns over time in all Nordic-Baltic region countries: extensive forestry, clear-cut forestry, retention forestry and currently evolving climate-adaptive forestry. Nevertheless, regional differences among the Nordic-Baltic countries, especially in forest regeneration-related legislation, were identified due to a mixture of international and local driving forces.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the existing patterns of ring roads in four diverse cities-Greater Amman in Jordan, Kuwait City in Kuwait, Oslo in Norway, and Greater Helsinki in Finland-to explore how these patterns respond to growth and elucidate the contemporary urban practices of these cities. Spatial mapping was used to measure density, mixed land use, and accessibility and identify growth characteristics parallel to the tracing processes of spatial insertion, replacement, and use change. The results illustrate that in master plans, the areas alongside ring roads were delineated either too vaguely or too prescriptively. The existing patterns of road and land use, particularly high residential concentrations, challenge the functionality of ring roads and negatively affects urban spatial qualities and services that should accompany the high-density study areas. Cumulatively, they have formed spatial non-homogeneities that challenge accessibility and dependency factors. In addition, the growth indicators represent urbanisation processes, generative schemes, and counter-formulation actions, where the replacement of the physical structure and functional character of ring roads as road restructuring is a prerequisite for generating less vulnerable urban structures. Therefore, the cases presented here raise important questions about the challenges and potential of ring roads and the areas alongside them in urban structures, in the context of the sustainable growth agenda.

AB  - Today, concerns prevail about the unsustainable use of phosphorus and worldwide eutrophication, thus requiring efficient management of phosphorus flows. With increasing population and associated urban growth, urban management of phosphorus flows in the perspectives of recycling, eutrophication and total budget becomes increasingly important. This study mapped phosphorus flows for a reference year (2013) and a future year (2030) using different scenarios for the city of Stockholm, Sweden. The results indicated that the Swedish goal of recycling phosphorus from wastewater would cover the majority of the total phosphorus budget for Stockholm. However, in 2013, only 10% of phosphorus was recycled for agricultural use, around half of which was from sewage sludge and the other half from food waste. Almost 50% of total phosphorus was sent to landfill/mining waste capping with sewage sludge, for economic reasons and lack of market. Among the scenarios of upstream and downstream urban management options studied in combination with population growth, recovery of phosphorus from sewage sludge had the greatest potential to increase the fraction recycled to agriculture. However, only upstream measures, e.g. changed diet, were able to reduce the total phosphorus budget. Urban management of phosphorus flows based on the different perspectives of recycling, eutrophication or total budgetwas shown to potentially result in different preferred management actions and both upstream and downstream measures need to be considered. Moreover, management needs to pay attention to small but environmentally sensitive flows, particularly when setting city goals on phosphorus recycling by percentage in a large budget.

AB  - Wood-pastures are threatened anthropogenic biotopes that provide habitat for an extensive group of species. Here we studied the effect of management, grazing intensity, time since abandonment, historical land-use in-tensity, soil properties and stand conditions on communities of saprotrophic fungi in wood-pastures in Central Finland. We found that the proportion of broadleaved trees and soil pH are the major drivers in the communities of saprotrophic fungi in these boreal wood-pastures. In addition, tree species richness, soil moisture, historical land-use intensity and time since abandonment affected the communities of saprotrophic fungi. Current man-agement or grazing intensity did not have a clear effect on saprotrophic fungal species richness, although dung -inhabiting fungal species richness was highest at intermediate to high grazing intensity. Obviously, there were many more dung-inhabiting fungal species on grazed than on abandoned sites. Our study highlights the con-servation value of wood-pastures as hotspots of saprotrophic fungi.

AB  - This paper summarizes the results of recent studies concerning the agricultural nutrient load to surface waters in Finland and possible management practices for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural land. Both the nitrogen and the phosphorus load exceed the loads from municipal and industrial sources together, thus being mainly responsible for the eutrophication of surface and coastal waters. 25% of the total agricultural phosphorus load is bioavailable dissolved reactive phosphorus, and 5% of the particulate phosphorus load is available for algae. Reduced tillage, filter strips and permanent grassland on the set-aside land are means investigated for reducing erosion and nutrient losses. Based on experiments and model simulations, it is estimated that a wide adoption of all these practices would reduce total phosphorus load by about 40%. Soluble phosphorus and nitrogen losses can be reduced by adjusting the amount and timing of fertilization and manure application to the actual needs of plants. If the whole set-aside area was under permanent grassland, the nitrogen loss would decrease by about 17%, but the effect of cover or undersown crops in Finnish conditions is still unknown. More investigations are also needed of the effects of all these management practices on the soluble phosphorus load.

AB  - Media content analysis was used with the aim of developing an understanding of how the debate on large-scale wind power has played out over time in Sweden, especially in relation to the enactment of national interest areas for wind power. Covering the period 1999 to 2019 and using NVivo for coding and analysis, we reviewed a total of 788 articles in both national and regional daily newspapers. To identify which actors are present in media and how they frame large-scale wind power, we conducted a frame analysis by applying three theoretical elements developed by previous media studies. The first is a diagnostic element used to pinpoint the cause to a problem, the second a prognostic element used to pinpoint the solution to a problem, and the third a motivating element used to identify the person(s) or object(s) suffering from the problem, that is, victim. Our results emphasize that wind power in recent years has been framed as a solution more often than a cause to a problem. One prevailing framing is the localization of large-scale wind power per se and conflicts with other land-uses and national interests. We also identify a tension between international and national policy objectives and local implementation of large-scale wind power. Governmental agencies are the most common framers over time, together with individuals (e.g. locals and second home owners) and wind entrepreneurs. Importantly, whereas politicians and wind entrepreneurs most often frame wind power as a solution, individuals frame it as a cause to a problem.

AB  - The degree of naturalness was assessed in 37 mature (stand age 80-198 yrs) Norway spruce dominated stands located in southern Finland by measuring the number (0-610 ha(-1)) and basal area (0-33 M(2)ha(-1)) of cut stumps. The Johnson's S-B distribution was fitted for living spruce trees to describe the dbh-frequency and basal area-dbh distributions. Regression models were constructed for predicting the parameters of the S-B distribution using traditional stand parameters (median diameter, basal area, stem number) and the cut stump variables (number, basal area). Stump variables improved the models and enabled to explain the differences in diameter distributions between stands with varying intensity of past cutting. Model for basal area-dbh distribution was more accurate than dbh-frequency model in terms of regression statistics, but less accurate in terms of generated stand variables. The number and basal area of cut stumps seem to be useful and simple measures of stand naturalness which have potential uses in stand modelling and biodiversity-oriented forestry planning.

AB  - Biodiversity has not only become one of the basic environmental policy objectives in both international and national political arenas but also an elementary part of the general discourse of global environmental change. Biodiversity has been claimed to give a new meaning to 'nature'. Has it also changed the way countryside and agriculture are constructed in the context of agri-environmental policymaking?
   This paper explores how nature in the form of biodiversity and rurality are constructed in the context of Finnish agri-environmental policy-making and 'biodiversity policies'. Lefebvre's (1991) theory of space is used as an analytical framework to show that rurality is produced in policy processes both as an image and as a concrete geo-social reality. Empirical results are based on interviews with members of Finnish networks in the domain of agricultural biodiversity (government officials, researchers and members of interest organisations and NGOs) and on analysis of policy documents. The key focus is on the outcomes of policy and the difficulties with scale the policymakers were facing when trying to integrate biodiversity into the Finnish Agri-Environmental Scheme.

AB  - Urban planning and management need long-term population level studies for evaluating how urbanization influences biodiversity. Firstly, we reviewed the current population trends of the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) in Europe, and evaluated the usefulness of citizens' science projects to monitor these species in Finland. Secondly, we conducted a long-term (1991-2020) winter field study in 31 urban settlements along a 950 km north-south extent in Finland to study how latitude, weather and urbanization influence on sparrow's growth rates. The House Sparrow is declining in 15 countries, and increasing in 5, whereas the Eurasian Tree Sparrow is declining in 12 and increasing in 9 European countries. The trend of the House Sparrow was significantly negative in continental Europe. However, the trend of the Eurasian Tree Sparrow was not significant. Both species have declined simultaneously in six countries, whereas in four countries, their trends are opposite. Citizen-based, long-term (2006-2020) winter season project data indicated that House Sparrow has decreased, whereas Eurasian Tree Sparrow has increased in Finland. However, the short-term (2013-2020) breeding season citizen-based project data did not indicate significant changes in the occupation rate of sparrows. Our long-term (1991-2020) field study indicated that wintering populations of the House Sparrow have decreased, whereas the Eurasian Tree Sparrows have both expanded their wintering range and increased their population size. Based on our winter count data, latitude and weather did not significantly influence the growth rates of sparrows. When the human population increased within the study plot, House Sparrow populations decreased, and vice versa. There was also a trend that a decreasing number of feeding sites has decreased the House Sparrow numbers. Urban-related factors did not influence the growth rate of the Eurasian Tree Sparrow. Our results indicate that the colonization of a new, even closely related species does not influence negatively on earlier urbanized species. It is probable that the niches of these sparrow species are different enough for allowing them to co-occur. The House Sparrow mainly nests on buildings, whereas the Eurasian Tree Sparrow can easily accept, e.g., nest boxes. Urban planning should take care of both the food availability and nest sites availability for both sparrow species.

AB  - Collaboration between different actors is crucial for responding to the acute need for forest biodiversity conservation. Network theories highlight the importance of information sharing, social cohesion and mutual goals that constitute social capital. We test and demonstrate how these ties relate to each other and which ones are crucial for collaboration in a government funded collaborative network for forest biodiversity and Siberian Jay conservation in Finland. Our analysis shows that short-term governance networks operate on trust. Seemingly, differences in goals can be put aside for a collective good; that is, being able to cooperate and find solutions to conservation issues. Additionally, exchange and flow of information are a necessity in network functions. However, a network may be successful despite difficulties in flow of information, as our case of Siberian Jay Network shows. Using both qualitative and quantitative evidence, our analysis serves as a test for the usefulness of social network analysis method in bringing depth to understanding of both formal and informal governance networks.

AB  - This study investigated public aesthetic preferences regarding naturally occurring dead and downed wood in Norwegian boreal forests. In an Internet-based survey conducted in cooperation with a commercial polling company, 1082 respondents from south-eastern and middle Norway were asked to rate 24 photos of forest settings. All photos had been taken at a stand level in primary or lightly altered semi-natural forests, although this was not disclosed to the respondents. Survey participants showed a clearly greater preference for images of forests settings containing little or no visible dead or downed wood. Participants also rated photos of forest settings with the dead wood elements removed through digital manipulation substantially higher than otherwise identical non-manipulated photos. However, public aesthetic perception of dead wood in forest setting did appear to be influenced by their understanding of the ecological benefits dead wood provides to forest biodiversity. Photos shown with an accompanying text describing the ecology or natural history of forest scenes containing dead wood received significantly higher ratings than identical photos without accompanying text. Our results suggest that those involved in maintaining or increasing forest biodiversity by retaining standing and fallen dead wood also need to incorporate outreach efforts that educate the public about the ecological benefits of these forest elements.

AB  - Clogmia albipunctata (Williston, 1893) is a moth fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) which occurs in synanthropic habitats in tropical and subtropical climates all over the world, particularly drains and kitchen sinks which has earned it the moniker "drain fly". Since the 1990s, however, its range has expanded rapidly northwards into temperate climates and it now occurs as far North as Karelia (Russia) and Finland. As it occurs together with humans and can be detected easily from photographs it is a species whose invasion can be tracked easily; inspection of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish nature photography web sites www.artsobservasjoner.no, www.artportalen.se and www.naturbasen.dk reveal its established presence in Denmark and Sweden, whereas no records hitherto have been presented from Norway. The records are all from large metropolitan areas, except one Danish record which is on the Southern border with Germany where the species has been established for a much longer time. The oldest Swedish images are from 2016 and the first Danish specimens appear in 2018. It remains unknown to which degree C. albipunctata poses a risk to native biodiversity, but records from Slovakia in 2012 revealed that it can breed in habitats used by native species also in temperate Europe.

AB  - Contemporary accounts of the inner urban fringe tend to focus on the transition from rural to urban land use and rural-Urban conflicts, rather than highlighting the landscape at the city edge in its own right. It is argued in this paper that such dichotomous accounts neglect the complexity, values and conflicts of fringe landscapes. The study iiustrates that an investigation into the relationship between attempts within spatial planning to design orderly v places for urban expansion and the evolvement of places out of order offers a way to analyse landscape transformations at the fringe beyond the rural-urban divide. This approach will offer a multifaceted analysis of the landscape, which in turn will facilitate a more open discussion on land use and values within planning. A theoretical discussion on the interplay between ordered and disordered places is followed by a case study of the interactions between a disordered place and the ambitions within spatial planning to create order. The study has been conducted at the fringe of Burlov (in southernmost Sweden). By way of conclusion, the findings of the case study are summarized, along with arguments that underline the need lot further case studies of fringe landscapes.

AB  - Offsets for compensating biodiversity loss are increasingly suggested as a system for allocating responsibilities onto those actors who contribute to the loss. As the mechanism is outlined as a new opportunity, the expectations need to be analyzed relative to the ensuing changes in rights and responsibilities over biodiversity degradation, conservation and restoration. In this paper we conduct an analysis of rights and responsibilities using literature and empirical material. Our empirical case is in Finland, where ecological compensation and biodiversity offsets represent an emerging avenue for conservation. We find that rights to conservation, property and economic activity have generally not been explicitly addressed in parallel, and that the focus has been on evaluating biodiversity loss through ecological assessment or as an ethical notion. Offsetting literature focuses on developer rights to a predictable operational environment rather than on human rights to biodiversity or the property rights of offset suppliers. At the same time, the literature on offsets analyzing the responsibilities over management, avoiding degradation and meeting societal expectations, has placed much emphasis on governance and control by authorities. These analyses result in doubts and criticism of the capacity of governance arrangements to reach the set targets. Echoing the literature, the Finnish case shows that even though the mechanism is framed as a way to place the responsibility onto developers, numerous responsibilities are expected to be taken by authorities or a yet non-existing mediating actor, while developer rights are expected to be secured and landowner rights are either mostly assumed not to change, or not addressed at all. Our study shows that the assumptions on rights and responsibilities need to be exposed to empirical analysis, to support the design of meaningful new institutional arrangements.

AB  - This paper explores the link between urban planning and hydrological mechanisms. Using a hydrological model, it assesses the relative influence of different urban-development and water-management modes on sewer-system overflows. It combines and compares the impacts of three climate change scenarios going up to 2100, which take into account the implementation of various urban-development strategies, as well as two demographic scenarios. Using this method, the study weighs the importance of the different hydrological mechanisms at play and proposes land-development strategies to implement with regards to climate change and population.
   The city of Nantes, the hydraulic network of which is well documented, serves as a case study. The results show that, in Nantes, climate change might have a smaller impact on overflows than population growth and urban development in certain scenarios. To limit overflows, insofar as there is no change in water use, this study suggests densifying existing urban areas served by a separative sewer system. It also provides a comparative appraisal of common and alternative water-management practices to reduce overflow.
   Simulations of different scenarios can help to foster a better understanding of the relationship between urban management and hydrological mechanisms.

AB  - Norway exemplifies a number of paradoxes in relation to the just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy provision. We investigate these paradoxes by focusing on key controversies from the oil and gas sector and onshore wind power. Despite the widespread interest in avoiding conflict and increasing public acceptance, this article sees controversies as useful sites for uncovering justice issues in possible transition pathways. The controversies reveal competing interpretations of just transition amidst an inadequate cross-cutting policy response. Conventional solutions for restructuring petro-maritime industries involve taking controversies out of sight from the public and internalizing the issue of just transition to the sector's needs. This achieves only shallow engagement with broader society regarding the scope of societal transition needed to meet climate policies. Controversies around onshore wind installations are on the doorsteps of communities themselves and call attention to the difficult social aspects of transition that require a much broader public debate and policy response. We conclude that just transition should not be interpreted sectorally in competing energy futures but rather should infiltrate both the fossil and renewables sides of the Norwegian energy provision paradox.Key policy insightsPolicies must take stock of controversies and acknowledge and unravel them to understand justice issues rather than seek to minimize them for political expedience.Just transition policies should not be limited to directly affected sectors and locations to minimize controversies but should reach broader aspects of society to enable the deepest scope of transition (from the industrial sector to community and society).Just development of renewable energy in Norway requires consideration of procedural, distributional, recognition and restorative aspects of energy development.Energy policy targets need to be both long-term and inclusive.More attention is needed to the oil and gas supply-side and energy demand reduction to connect the energy transition with ambitious climate policies.

AB  - Gaps in knowledge of current and past forest ecosystem research in the temperate zone of Europe are discussed and research priorities are defined. Since the last Ice Age the forest ecosystems of this region have undergone fundamental changes mainly caused by climatic and anthropogenic influences. Hence, today's temperate forests hardly represent the natural ecosystem development state. However, the implementation of the sustainability concept as the dominant principle of modern forestry in the early 19th century allowed to predict and maintain forest productivity in the longer run.
   Despite timber production forest management has to cover public demands such as recreation, groundwater protection, and biodiversity. But it is still unclear whether all these requirements can be fulfilled economically and in agreement with the concept of ecological sustainability. Even though the understanding of forest ecosystems has increased enormously in recent decades, this improved understanding has resulted, somewhat paradoxically, in a demand for further knowledge, both more precise in nature and broader in scope. The ongoing discussion on forest stability is based on the experience that predictions of an enhanced dieback of forests did not come true. On the contrary, the growth of many European forests has been accelerated since several decades, illustrating a fundamental lack in the understanding of the productivity of forest ecosystems.
   In conclusion, specific gaps of knowledge are identified with regard to (i) the impacts of elevated CO2 and nitrogen on the stability and resilience of forest ecosystems, (ii) the functioning of old-growth (semi-)natural forests and the development of scientifically based concepts for forest transformation, (iii) the multiple interactions between forest and adjacent management systems, (iv) the afforestation of set-aside and abandoned areas, and (v) the intensification, methodological complementation and diversification of the monitoring of forest sites belonging to the EU 'level-two-programme'.

AB  - Coordinating and implementing ecosystem restoration projects can be challenging when the professions involved have differing perceptions of ecological restoration and implementation in practice. To overcome these barriers in complex restoration projects, we suggest analysing ecosystem restoration as a boundary object, a concept drawn from the field of science and technology studies. We use a large scale restoration project in the Dovre Mountains of Norway to demonstrate the validity of using the boundary object concept in this context. The restoration involves a former military training area where the goal of the project was to protect and restore the environment and allow for civilian use. We examine how the different professions developed sufficient mutual understanding to make the project work. In particular, we explore the extent to which the perceptions of different professions overlap, the diversity of the perceptions in the project and how this might influence the outcome of the restoration. The boundary object concept offers potential to help improve restoration quality and reduce conflicts.

AB  - Dead wood is an important resource for biodiversity, which has often decreased due to forest management. There is an increasing interest in extracting woody residues on clear-cuts for bioenergy production, which will further decrease dead wood amounts. Empirical studies show that such extraction decreases habitat availability for many species at a local scale, but no analyses have been made on long-term effects on population sizes and species persistence in whole landscapes. We investigated how theoretical species that differ in dispersal range, habitat specialization, and commonness are affected by different levels of wood extraction intensity. We also investigated the effect of extracting only slash (branches and tops) compared to both slash and stumps, and the spatial location of the extraction. This was done by simulations of dead wood development and species' colonization extinction dynamics based on metapopulation theory. The simulations were run for 200 years in an 11 x 11 km managed forest landscape in Sweden. For all species the predicted population sizes decreased, and for six out of eight species the landscape level extinction risks increased with increasing bioenergy extraction. The negative impacts were larger when including stumps compared to extracting slash only. However, rare species declined more strongly with increasing extraction than the common species. Specialists on coarse sun-exposed wood declined more than generalists when stumps were included in the extraction, while the pattern was the opposite when only extracting slash. The population declines continued for up to 200 years before colonizations and extinctions were in equilibrium, and were generally slower for rare compared to common species. Concentrating the extraction to 50% of the landscape had a positive effect on rare and short dispersing species, which could be assumed to be the most threatened species. Thus, bioenergy extraction is likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity, which are most severe when stumps are extracted at a high intensity throughout the landscape. Even at low levels of stump extraction, species which are already rare and specialized on sun-exposed coarse dead wood may be threatened. Slash extraction has probably less impact, since few species are specialized on fine woody debris. Concentrating the extraction to a subset of forested areas may reduce the negative impact. The apparent direct trade-off between the amount of bioenergy extracted and the remaining amount of dead-wood habitat may require that bioenergy extraction is either limited or further conservation interventions are employed that compensate for anthropogenic habitat loss.

AB  - The negative effect of agricultural intensification on bumblebee populations is thought to partly be caused by loss of food plants, for example because of increased field size and concomitant loss of non-crop field borders and their nectar and pollen plants. Earlier studies have focused on how loss of foraging resources affects colony growth and thereby abundance of workers and sexual reproduction. By comparing bumblebees in agricultural landscapes of different complexity in Southern Sweden, we here demonstrate that also the adult size of bumblebee foragers is significantly related to the availability of foraging resources. This effect was independent of both species identity and foraging habitat type. This suggests a shortage of flower resources in landscapes of lower complexity, which may also affect the reproductive success of colonies negatively.

AB  - The need to develop sustainable stormwater management is intensifying due to climate impacts and urban densification. Such complex planning processes require insights into disparate issues, connecting heterogeneous actors. While many decision-support tools are developed to facilitate such planning, research assessing their usefulness is requested. This study introduces and assesses one such ICT-tool; the Visual Water platform, aiming to support sustainable stormwater planning in Swedish municipalities. The study aims to identify critical points to consider for developers of related decision-support tools and to detangle requirements and tradeoffs in making them relevant and user-friendly, building on test-sessions with Swedish practitioners. Results show that the platform responds to challenges within municipal planning as outlined by Swedish practitioners. However, though the platform content is considered relevant, its application in real-world planning is perceived as somewhat unclear. The paper discusses ideas for how sustainability-related decision-support tools better can respond to user demands.

The historical significance of tar production, an important livelihood for centuries, has had extensive environmental and ecological impacts, particularly in the thinly inhabited northern and eastern parts of Finland. Despite being one of the most widespread archaeological features in the country, tar kilns have received relatively little attention until recently. The authors employed a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) U-Net-based algorithm to detect these features from the ALS data, which proved to be more accurate, faster, and capable of covering systematically larger spatial areas than human actors. It also produces more consistent, replicable, and ethically sustainable results. This semi-automated approach enabled the efficient location of a vast number of previously unknown archaeological features, significantly increasing the number of tar kilns in each study area compared to the previous situation. This has implications also for the cultural resource management in Finland. The authors' findings have influenced the preparation of the renewal of the Finnish Antiquities Act, raising concerns about the perceived impacts on cultural heritage management and land use sectors due to the projected tenfold increase in archaeological site detection using deep learning algorithms. The use of environmental remote sensing data may provide a means of examining the long-term cultural and ecological impacts of tar production in greater detail. Our pilot studies suggest that artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize archaeological research and cultural resource management in Finland, offering promising avenues for future exploration.

AB  - Populations of snakes and other reptiles are declining worldwide. Habitat loss and degradation is thought to be a significant factor in these declines, so to improve management strategies it is important to increase our understanding of reptilian habitat requirements. Modern agriculture is abandoning the tradition of gathering compost and manure in large heaps. Consequently these unusually warm environments are disappearing from the landscape. This may imperil populations of grass snakes (Natrix natrix) that rely on these anthropogenic heat sources to incubate their eggs. We conducted a relocation experiment to examine if eggs can develop successfully in other more natural environments that grass snakes potentially could utilize in the absence of manure heaps and compost piles. We found that hatching success was high (71 %) when we placed eggs in manure heaps and non-existent (0 %) when we placed them in potential 'natural' nests. Placement in compost piles resulted in intermediate (43 %) hatching success. Eggs in manure heaps hatched earlier than eggs in compost piles and thermal data from the nests showed that temperatures were higher and more stable in manure heaps than in compost piles and potential 'natural' nests. Jointly these results suggest that manure heaps generally provide a better nesting habitat than compost piles, attributable to thermal differences between the environments. Our findings facilitate improvement of current management strategies and have implications for conservation of oviparous reptiles in general.

AB  - Nearly all European Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) populations have had a similar fate during the 20th century. In the first two decades, if not earlier, dramatic decreases and even extirpations of many local populations occurred due to heavy persecution. There was then a recovery period until the second decrease from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, caused by DDT and other contaminants. Since then, populations have been recovering. The annual rates of population increase have varied from about 1% in Fennoscandia to about 10% in Scotland during the last 20 years. At present, 90% of all European Ospreys breed in Finland, Sweden and Russia. The nesting habitats vary widely from steep cliffs in the Mediterranean to closed climax coniferous forests, open peat bogs and large clear-cut areas in northern Europe. In some areas (e.g., Finland), cutting of old, flat-topped potential new nests by intensive commercial forestry has been the most important national threat for the local Osprey population during the last three decades. As early as the late 1960s dedicated bird banders started to construct artificial nests for Ospreys to compensate for the losses caused by one-track forestry. In 1995, 46% of all occupied Finnish Osprey nests (N = 951) were artificial. Also, clear-cuts around nesting trees are harmful because nests become more exposed to storms, predation by Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and disturbances. In Finland and some other countries, new guidelines for foresters also account for the welfare of the Osprey However, the principles and practices are still quite far from each other.

AB  - The conflicts that frequently manifest in the Swedish mountains often stem from the use and preservation of natural resources. Resistance against protected area proposals, protests concerning the management of large carnivores, the felling of old-growth forests, and disputes over who should be allowed to hunt or fish are all commonplace. There are currently strong trends, both in national and international policy making, towards leaning on various forms of collaborative governance arrangements to deal with such policy failures. Consequently, various forms of partnerships have been initiated to promote more sustainable practices in the mountain regions of Sweden. To what extent has the creation of these collaborative partnerships in natural resource management improved policy output and sustainability outcomes? To examine the issue, data was extracted from 47 semi-structured interviews with 39 project leaders and eight county officials, with the sample randomly selected from a database of 245 public-private collaborative projects in the Swedish mountains. The results indicate that partnerships do lead to improved sustainability, especially when it comes to social outcomes. However, there is a need for more systematic follow-ups by practitioners, particularly on ecological outcomes, where the country administrative boards should take a leading role and facilitate such evaluations in the future.

AB  - In 2018, a strategy for Sweden's first National Forest Program was launched. As part of its implementation, County Administrative Boards have initiated dialogue processes for drafting regional forest strategies. Stakeholder deliberation is ascribed the potential to promote trust and mutual understanding, lead to more robust decisions and smoother implementation. We examine the dialogue processes, focusing on the two regions of Vastra Gotaland and Gavleborg, by posing three questions: 1) How are the current regional dialogue processes within the National Forest Program designed, and why in this way? 2) To what extent do the dialogues hitherto live up to key conditions needed to reach communicative action as articulated by Habermas and best practices as identified in the academic literature on stakeholder participation in natural resource management and policy? 3) What implications could these findings have for the potential of the dialogue processes to contribute to reconciling the overriding goal conflicts as they play out in Swedish forestry? For the inquiry, we used semi-structured interviews, document analysis and a survey. The study concludes that a clear effort is made to include a variety of actors in the process. However, for successful dialogues important preconditions need to be addressed; long-term funding for the dialogues needs to be secured, and the overall role of the NFP and of the regional dialogue processes should be clarified. The analysis also shows that fundamental goal conflicts in the Swedish forestry sector, primarily between timber production and conservation goals, should be handled more explicitly at the national level.

AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest certification system is a globally widespread market-driven mechanism that aims at responsible use and governance of forests, and its application is growing. However, the extent to which forest certification contributes effectively to maintaining forest biodiversity is an unresolved issue. We assessed the role of FSC certification for forest biodiversity conservation in Lithuania's state forests. First, we analysed the indicators related to biodiversity conservation at different spatial scales in the FSC standard used in Lithuania. By applying morphological spatial pattern analysis and habitat suitability modelling, we explored the structural and functional connectivity of forest habitat patches of formally and voluntarily set-asides for biodiversity conservation. According to the Lithuanian FSC standard, active measures in forest management for biodiversity should be imposed at three spatial scales: 'trees in a stand', 'stands in a landscape', and 'landscape in an ecoregion'. The total area set aside for biodiversity was 18.6 %, including 4.9 % voluntary set-asides. The quality of habitats in terms of forest stand age was low, only 9.4 % of all set-asides constituted older forests. The proportions of voluntary set-aside area varied among the different state forest enterprises, and the results indicated a clear trend to set aside non-forest or low productivity forest habitats. Small (<1 ha) habitat patches formed a major part of all set-asides, including formally protected areas. FSC certification alone was not able to maintain structural and functional connectivity of forests for species at multiple spatial scales in Lithuania. By keeping a minimum standard of 5 % forestland set aside for biodiversity, the state forest enterprises certified according to the FSC can only satisfy forest species with small habitat requirements. To maintain biodiversity, place-based learning among stakeholders for representative functional green infrastructures in concrete landscapes and regions, combined with transparent knowledge about the net effect of pressures and responses on the state of biodiversity, are necessary.

AB  - Finland is to increase the share of RES (renewable energy sources) up to 38% in final energy consumption by 2020. While benefiting from local biomass resources Finnish energy system is deemed to achieve this goal, increasing the share of other intermittent renewables is under development, namely wind power and solar energy. Yet the maximum flexibility of the existing energy system in integration of renewable energy is not investigated, which is an important step before undertaking new renewable energy obligations. This study aims at filling this gap by hourly analysis and comprehensive modeling of the energy system including electricity, heat, and transportation, by employing EnergyPLAN tool. Focusing on technical and economic implications, we assess the maximum potential of different RESs separately (including bioenergy, hydropower, wind power, solar heating and PV, and heat pumps), as well as an optimal mix of different technologies. Furthermore, we propose a new index for assessing the maximum flexibility of energy systems in absorbing variable renewable energy. The results demonstrate that wind energy can be harvested at maximum levels of 18-19% of annual power demand (approx. 16 TWh/a), without major enhancements in the flexibility of energy infrastructure. With today's energy demand, the maximum feasible renewable energy for Finland is around 44-50% by an optimal mix of different technologies, which promises 35% reduction in carbon emissions from 2012's level. Moreover, Finnish energy system is flexible to augment the share of renewables in gross electricity consumption up to 69-72%, at maximum. Higher shares of RES calls for lower energy consumption (energy efficiency) and more flexibility in balancing energy supply and consumption (e.g. by energy storage). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sparse, incomplete and inappropriate historical records of invasive species often hamper invasive species management interventions. Population genetic analyses of invaders might provide a suitable context for the identification of their source populations and possible introduction routes. Here, we describe the population genetics of Heracleum persicum Desf. ex Fisch and trace its route of introduction into Europe. Microsatellite markers revealed a significantly higher genetic diversity of H. persicum in its native range, and the loss of diversity in the introduced range may be attributed to a recent genetic bottleneck. Bayesian cluster analysis on regional levels identified three and two genetic clusters in the native and the introduced ranges, respectively. A global structure analysis revealed two worldwide distinct genetic groups: one primarily in Iran and Denmark, the other primarily in Norway. There were also varying degrees of admixture in England, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. Approximate Bayesian computation indicated two independent introductions of H. persicum from Iran to Europe: the first one in Denmark and the second one in England. Finland was subsequently colonized by English populations. In contrast to the contemporary hypothesis of English origin of Norwegian populations, we found Finland to be a more likely source for Norwegian populations, a scenario supported by higher estimated historical migration from Finland to Norway. Genetic diversity per se is not a primary determinant of invasiveness in H. persicum. Our results indicate that, due to either pre-adaptations or rapid local adaptations, introduced populations may have acquired invasiveness after subsequent introductions, once a suitable environment was encountered.

AB  - Agriculture is one sector under pressure when it comes to mitigation of climate change. To overcome the economic barriers preventing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures from being implemented, this paper explores whether crowdfunding could be a feasible solution to this problem. The paper theoretically and empirically explores sociocultural barriers and enablers for crowdfunding aimed at agricultural GHG mitigation measures in Norway. The empirical analysis is based on focus-group interviews with farmers as potential fund-seekers and citizens as potential backers. The data are analysed in light of certain cultural characteristics previously identified as typical for Norway. Our findings indicate that, while these cultural characteristics manifest themselves in a crowdfunding context, they are not all-embracing. Our analysis points to opportunities for successful crowdfunding for GHG mitigation measures in agriculture given the right premises and including the right motivated people.

AB  - Purpose: The objectives of this study are to (a) invest adaptively in the cultural assets which play a part in generating the cultural identity manifestations, (b) review a group of sustainable bottom-up-centred and/or circular economy-based projects (CHRISTA and Vastra Gotaland Regional Development Policy (SE); CLIC; Be.CULTOUR), and (c) strategically support the sustainable culture tourism process in Forsvik (a Swedish industrial heritage destination) by involving the local community members. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was carried out in Forsvik as a circular governance model adopting a people-centred approach. The research qualitatively presents its review through a descriptive analysis of the aforementioned projects. In addition, the paper consists of two in-depth individual interviews with the key governmental decision makers, as well as the experience of the 1st author as a project leader. Findings: The results show a People-Public-Private Partnership approach, as a community-driven social innovation tool, that seeks to operationalize a strategic dynamic partnership mainly among three partners: (1) people or the host community, (2) the public sector, and (3) the private sector. Originality/Value: One of the contributions of this study is to develop a corporate committee valorising and emancipating the role of community engagement in circular governance providing a sustainable people-centred cultural tourism strategy.

AB  - Introduced tree species are increasingly being considered for use in production forestry due to production targets, and demand for a diversity of wood products. However, prior to expanding their use, active consideration needs to be given to the breadth of potential ecological consequences associated with each introduced tree species. Ecological consequences include the invasion and modification of sensitive ecosystems, changes in habitat provision for native taxa, altered risk of pest and pathogen outbreaks, and hybridization with native con-generics. Here we review the scientific literature to assess the potential ecological consequences from expanding the use of introduced tree species within Swedish forestry. We use an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate ecological risks, and our assessment is based on the scenario that a proportion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures in southern Sweden will be replaced by monocultures of Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), hybrid aspen (Populus tremula tremuloides), or hybrid larch (Larix eurolepis/L. marschlinsii). Our results highlight that univariate consideration of the ecological consequences of exotic tree species can be highly misleading, due to the complex suite of costs, benefits, risks and uncertainties that each tree species brings to the region of introduction. We discuss our results in relation to conflicting management goals, and the lack of reversibility of some adverse ecological outcomes. We also highlight the need for assessments of ecological risk to facilitate evidence-based decision making by stakeholders. Our results provide a foundation for adaptive management programs aiming to limit the extent to which introduced tree species used in production forestry are accompanied by adverse ecological impacts.

Content analysis has been employed.FindingsThree categories of meanings are the main findings: general perception, safeguarding Swedish secular values and financially unjustifiable have been discovered. Most of the respondents have been sceptical towards halal and Muslim-friendly hotel concepts due to financial and cultural challenges these two concepts have for the Swedish tourism and hotel industries. Based on the SET, this entails more costs than benefits and is especially at odds with Swedish-rooted secular values.Practical implicationsThis study provides practical implications and increased knowledge for tourism stakeholders including hotels in Sweden.Originality/valueThis is one of the very few studies on halal tourism in Scandinavia and the first Scandinavian study on hoteliers' attitudes towards halal tourism.

AB  - Reduced pollution of surface waters by nutrients is the expressed objective of several international conventions, e.g. HELCOM, OSPARCOM, and this task is also supported by EU directives and HELCOM recommendations. Thus, it was of great importance that a monitoring programme similar to the existing ones in the Nordic countries (e.g. Norway and Sweden) was implemented which specifically aimed at assessing the impact of agriculture on the surface water quality in Latvia. Leaching and runoff losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were measured in several agricultural catchments during the period 1994-1999. This article provides information on temporal and spatial trends of nutrient loads that may be associated with the anthropogenic impact of agriculture. The losses varied considerably depending on land use and farming practices. In catchments characterized by cereal production and moderate inputs of plant nutrients, the diffuse losses were found to be at a low level (e.g. 5-20 kg N ha(-1) per year), as compared to measurements in similar catchments in Nordic countries. Due to the economical problems during the current transition period to market economy in Latvia, most of the new private farmers do not apply intensive fanning methods. Therefore, diffuse pollution from private family farms is still low compared with most of the western countries. However, very large leaching and runoff losses were recorded in three catchments characterized by heavy applications of pig slurry and where the amounts of applied manure significantly surpassed the fertilizer requirements of the crops. In one of these catchments, high losses were recorded even though farming activities ceased in 1991/92. The study shows that the former Soviet-type large farms that specialized in animal production may still constitute potential risks for the environmental quality of inland waters in Latvia and of the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The Forest Time Machine is a forest decision-support system developed within the SUFOR (Sustainable Forestry in Southern Sweden) research programme. The system simulates the development of a forest area of up to about 25,000 ha, and results can be evaluated from a number of different perspectives. For a given area, a management alternative is chosen for each stand, and the system calculates the development of the stands in 5-year intervals for a specified time (normally > 100 years). An ordinary forest stand database is the minimum data requirement. Depending on what kinds of issues are to be analysed, additional data sources may be included. Particularly for multi-purpose forestry, it is very important to analyze different issues simultaneously. The system includes modules for tree growth, regeneration, mortality and decay of dead wood, forestry operations, economics, nutrient balances, and biodiversity indicators. A model for estimating the probability of wind-throw will be included as well. The current system does not optimize. Management alternatives are specified by the user. Its primary purpose is to evaluate and compare different management strategies for achieving multiple objectives over a planning horizon. Because the system is used in conjunction with a geographic information system, it is spatially explicit and has proven useful for analysing time and space interactions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Swedish municipalities use negotiable developer obligations and public land development in sustainability-profiled districts to achieve various public sustainability objectives. They initiate and govern these districts, which act as models for sustainable urban development and testbeds for new sustainability-related policies, using municipally owned land. Public land development in Sweden enables municipalities to include sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations in development agreements. The aim of the study is to investigate how Swedish municipalities use sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations together with public land development, and to identify what public value outcomes they currently seek to create by using these public value capture instruments. Sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations are investigated in relation to municipalities' desired public value outcomes in five sustainability-profiled district developments in different Swedish municipalities. Findings illustrate that Swedish municipalities use negotiable developer obligations to create ecological, social and cultural, political, and economic public value outcomes. This calls for more research investigating different forms of value and value creation in relation to public value capture instruments.

AB  - Management of harvested species is of great importance in order to maintain a sustainable population. Genetics is, however, largely neglected in management plans. Here, we analysed the genetics of the bean goose (Anser fabalis) in order to aid conservation actions for the commonly hunted but declining subspecies, the taiga bean goose (A. f. fabalis). We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellites to determine the subspecies composition of the Finnish bean goose harvest, as the hunting bag is thought to comprise two subspecies, the taiga bean goose and the tundra bean goose (A. f. rossicus). The latter subspecies has a more stable or even increasing population size. Other eastern subspecies (A. f. serrirostris, A. f. middendorffii) could additionally be part of the Finnish hunting bag. We estimated genetic diversity, genetic structure and sex-biased gene flow of the different subspecies. Most of the harvested bean geese belonged to the taiga bean goose, whereas most of the tundra bean goose harvest was found to be geographically restricted to southeastern Finland. The mtDNA data supported strong genetic structure, while microsatellites showed much weaker structuring. This is probably due to the extreme female philopatry of the species. The taiga bean goose had lowered genetic diversity compared to other subspecies, warranting management actions. We also detected A. f. serrirostris mtDNA haplotypes and evidence of interspecific hybridization with two other Anser species.

AB  - Many species have suffered population declines through loss of suitable habitat. In addition, current agricultural land use and human settlements favor generalist predators, which pose an increasing threat to ground-nesting bird species such as shorebirds (waders). During the last 2 decades, nest exclosures have been used to control nest-predation rates and often improved hatching success. We evaluated the effectiveness of protective nest-cages to boost reproductive success in the endangered southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) and ultimately to halt the population decline. We found that exclosures successfully increased the survival probability of nests and, thereby, the number of hatchlings, without markedly elevating the predation rate on incubating adults. Nest exclosures did not, however, translate into an increased number of fledglings and recruits produced/breeding adult in the population, showing that factors other than nest survival are also important for population development. Our results highlight that conservation efforts aimed only at removing high nest-predation pressure may be insufficient to preserve declining species such as the southern dunlin.

AB  - Disturbances and the consequent habitat heterogeneity are natural features of the boreal forest. Natural disturbances occurring at the level of populations, communities and ecosystems (meters to kilometers and years to hundreds of years), that is, at the 'meso-scale' may provide useful guidelines for forest management. This approach is based on the assumption that species are adapted to the disturbance regime of the forest-type that they occupy. However, natural disturbance and human-caused disturbance, such as clear-cutting, may differ substantially in their ecological effects. Potential differences occur on several scales. On the stand scale, removal or destruction of important habitat structures, such as coarse woody debris, during traditional clear-cutting may affect species. On the landscape scale, fragmentation may cause local extinctions and hamper the recolonization of maturing sites by old-growth specialists. The effect of these differences on boreal biota needs to be assessed. On the stand scale, the degree of recovery (resilience) of populations and communities after human-caused disturbance versus natural disturbance, that is, the succession process, could be a useful criterion when developing new forestry methods. On the landscape scale, it is important to maintain enough patches of suitable habitat for the old-growth species in order to prevent local extinctions and to promote recolonizations. Natural landscapes could be used as a reference here. In conclusion, although possibilities of matching forestry with maintenance of taiga biota through development of harvesting methods that mimic natural disturbance seem reasonably good, there is an urgent need to establish criteria for the assessment of the success or failure of such methods. The resilience of forest ecosystems as reflected in population changes of surrogate taxa after disturbance could be used to guide management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most climate change mitigation schemes in urban planning concentrate on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the distant future by altering the urban form and encouraging more sustainable behaviour. However, to reach climate change mitigation targets, a more immediate reduction in GHG emissions is also needed as well as a reduction in GHG emissions in other fields. This article evaluates the important role of earthworks in the prompt and substantial reduction required for GHG emissions. The research includes a single case study and three focus group interviews. The results of the case study reveal the magnitude of possible emission reductions through urban planners' control over earthworks, whereas the findings of the focus groups shed light on the relevance of the findings beyond the single case. Three urban planning solutions were implemented in the case area to reduce GHG emissions from earth construction, resulting in the saving of 2360 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Notable savings were also achieved in other emission categories. Such a successful management of rock and soil material flows requires a strong vision from the urban planner, cooperation among many different actors, and smart decisions in multiple planning phases. Furthermore, numerical data is needed to confirm the environmental benefits if the coordination of earthworks is to be widely included in regional climate change mitigation strategies.

AB  - A number of measures have been introduced into Swedish forestry in order to satisfy demands on biodiversity and sustainability. Protection measures include set asides, areas with continuous cover forestry and retention trees on harvesting sites, to name but a few. Most of these practices will have implications for the total wood supply of the Swedish forests. In 1998, the Swedish standard for forest certification according to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was approved. The standard adopts many detailed regulations regarding how forests should be managed. The aim of this study is to assess the likely effect of FSC certification on short- and long-term supply of roundwood in Sweden.
   A scenario, expressed as the distribution of the forest land base on production forests, areas with restrictions for management and reserves, is input into a simulation model in which forest owners are assumed to be guided by economic criteria when deciding on management. Four scenarios were created based on the data of the Swedish National Forest Inventory. For each scenario the short-term wood supply was assessed. Also, a number of long run simulations with different relative price levels are presented.
   The results indicate that full adoption of the FSC standard on the entire land base, compared with adherence only to the Forestry Act, could result in a substantial reduction in supply, or, conversely, could induce a price increase in case supplied quantities should be maintained at current levels. This is under the assumption that no compensating mechanisms, exogenous to the model, come into effect. Furthermore, a sustained price increase that would compensate for lost volumes today does not seem to prevail in the long run. In conclusion, the ongoing adaptation of Swedish forestry to the standards of the certification programs could have substantial effects on the timber supply and will probably influence the international competitiveness of the Swedish forest sector. Effects and tendencies like these should form integral parts of future analyses of wood balances and wood supply in a regional perspective. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The article describes and reflects upon how multi-level governance and planning in Sweden have been affected by and reacted upon three pending major challenges confronting humanity, namely climate change, migration and the Covid-19 pandemic. These 'crises' are broadly considered 'existential threats' in need of 'securitisation'. Causes and adequate reactions are contested, and there are no given solutions how to securitise the perceived threats, neither one by one, no less together. Government securitisation strategies are challenged by counter-securitisation demands, and plaguing vulnerable groups in society by in-securitising predicaments. Taking Sweden as an example the article applies an analytical approach drawing upon strands of securitisation, governance and planning theory. Targeting policy responses to the three perceived crises the intricate relations between government levels, responsibilities, capacities, and actions are scrutinized, including a focus upon the role of planning. Overriding research questions are: How has the governance and planning system - central, regional and local governments -in Sweden responded to the challenges of climate change, migration and Covid-19? What threats were identified? What solutions were proposed? What consequences could be traced? What prospects wait around the corner? Comparing crucial aspects of the crises' anatomies the article adds to the understanding of the way multilevel, cross-sectional, hybrid governance and planning respond to concurrent crises, thereby also offering clues for action in other geopolitical contexts. The article mainly draws upon recent and ongoing research on manifestations of three cases in the Swedish context. Applying a pragmatic, method-ological approach combining elements of securitisation, governance and planning theories with Carol Lee Bac-chi's 'What is the problem represented to be' and a touch of interpretive/narrative theory, the study reveals distinct differences between the anatomies of the three crises and their handling. Urgency, extension, state of knowledge/epistemology, governance and planning make different imprints on crises management. Sweden's long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies imply slow, micro-steps forward based on a combination of social-liberal, 'circular' and a touch of 'green growth' economies. Migration policy displays a Janus face, on the one hand largely respecting the UN refugee quota system on the other hand applying a detailed regulatory framework causing severe insecurity especially for minor refugees wanting to stay and make their living in Sweden. The Covid-19 outbreak revealed a lack of foresight and eroded/fragmented responsibility causing huge stress upon personnel in elderly and health care and appalling death rates among elderly patients, although governance and planning slowly adapted through securitising policies, leading to potential de-securitisation of the issue. The three crises have caused a security wake-up among governments at all levels and the public in general, and the article concludes by discussing whether this 'perfect storm' of crises will result in a farewell to neoliberalism - towards a neo-regulatory state facing further challenges and crises for gover-nance, planning and the role of planners. The tentative prospect rather indicates a mixture of context-dependent 'hybrid governance', thus also underlining the crucial role of planners' role as 'chameleons' in complicated governance processes of politics, policy and planning.

AB  - In order to formulate relevant understanding of key sustainability challenges, evidence-based decision-making relies on comprehensive data. While the complexity of producing and processing spatial data and the potential for biases are well recognised, the social process of making sense of data and its implications for societal uses is less analysed. In this article, insights of critical data studies are applied to study the production of, as well as uses and misuses of, the Finnish urban-rural classification. The classification structures Finland into three urban classes and four rural classes and offers an alternative to classifications that utilise administrative, municipal, and regional boundaries. The classification acts as a boundary object, functioning as a common reference for parties with varying information needs and interests. Using document analysis, as well as an insider action research methodology and our own experiences as data producers, this article aims to understand the processes of sense making of data in the context of urban-rural classification and identify ways of improving related information systems and data practices. Intended and realised uses of the classification are analysed in order to identify different ways in which data producers and users make sense of data and justify the utilisation of the classification. The process of sense-making starts from the planning of data production and shapes how data and eventually information system are formulated throughout the data cycle. Communication about the limitations of the classification remains an issue and highlights the nature of sense-making as a collective process wherein users are actively shaping data practices as they translate information systems into their own contexts. This also draws attention to the nature of information systems as inherently unneutral, inevitably affected by negotiations shaped by the various information needs.

AB  - This paper reviews some of the literature and guidance provided for businesses considering responses to the environmental aspects and impacts of their tourist activities. It concentrates on the role of destinations and stakeholders within the destination cooperating and networking to improve environmental performance and on generating a 'green' image. In order to move towards a type of tourism consistent with sustainable development (sustainable tourism), it is argued that we need to see enhanced management of a destination, creating opportunities for networking and cooperation between, in particular, service providers. In a case study of Lillehammer, Norway, three projects negotiated, developed and delivered by service providers in the area are examined. These projects looked at hotel management, transport and aesthetics. Success factors are identified, including the involvement of stakeholders, the development of locally orientated codes of conduct, the role and participation of local authorities and the importance of leadership. Findings add to the body of practical help in moving destinations towards sustainable tourism.

AB  - This paper analyses how specific institutional barriers and drivers affect the success of agri-environmental governance and policy innovations in four case study catchments in Germany, Latvia, Poland and Sweden. Possible adaptations of institutional settings are explored, aiming at increased effectiveness of policies and governance in delivering multiple ecosystem benefits along with reduced nutrient emissions and flood management. Factors of success synthesized from existing examples of innovative policy instruments in the EU and further afield are used to identify barriers and opportunities for the implementation of policy innovations in different institutional settings across the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). Key factors of success include close and trusting cooperation in scheme development, utilization of intermediaries in trust building, an active role of civil society and private sector, spatial targeting and coordination of measures, and result-based and long-term approaches. It is concluded that the effectiveness of measures can be increased by (i) adopting a less prescriptive approach to implementation, (ii) strengthening bottom-up participatory stakeholder learning processes, (iii) fostering cross-sectoral planning and funding initiatives, (iv) creating incentives for local collaborative actions, (v) developing cooperative nutrient management initiatives in the BSR and (vi) developing a systematic and coordinated approach to pilot-testing of new concepts and measures.

AB  - Despite the loss of natural ecosystems in the developed world during the past millennia, anthropogenic landscapes still sustain much biodiversity. Our question was, whether ten year changes in regional Odonata faunas are comparable between farmland and forested areas, or if the species pool of farmland areas respond in other ways than that of forest. We used data of dragonfly larvae collected from 16 lakes in a farmland area in south-western Sweden in the years 2002 and 2011/12, and compared these to data from 34 lakes in a forest area in south-eastern Sweden in the years 1996 and 2006. The species-richness in the agricultural region increased by 17% but decreased by 13% in the forested region. The changes in occurrence and regional distribution were similar in both areas, affecting 71% and 69% of the species pool. Average extinction rates were comparable between the agricultural and the forested region (38% and 43%) while colonisation rates differed greatly (64% and 114%). The species composition differed between the regions; the forest lakes harboured a 29% larger species pool. It is possible that in the forested region, the regional species pool in areas surrounding the study sites could stabilise the extinction and have a positive effect on changes in species composition. We assume that the different habitat structures of the waters in the agricultural and the forest regions and changes in temperature are the main driving forces behind the shifts. The mean seasonal air temperature has increased by circa 0.5 degrees C in both regions, when comparing ten-year periods before each sampling year.

AB  - Describing the evolutionary dynamics of now extinct populations is challenging, as their genetic composition before extinction is generally unknown. The Glanville fritillary butterfly has a large extant metapopulation in the Aland Islands in Finland, but declined to extinction in the nearby fragmented southwestern (SW) Finnish archipelago in the 20th century. We genotyped museum samples for 222 SNPs across the genome, including SNPs from candidate genes and neutral regions. SW Finnish populations had significantly reduced genetic diversity before extinction, and their allele frequencies gradually diverged from those in contemporary Aland populations over 80 y. We identified 15 outlier loci among candidate SNPs, mostly related to flight, in which allele frequencies have changed more than the neutral expectation. At outlier loci, allele frequencies in SW Finland shifted in the same direction as newly established populations deviated from old local populations in contemporary Aland. Moreover, outlier allele frequencies in SW Finland resemble those in fragmented landscapes as opposed to continuous landscapes in the Baltic region. These results indicate selection for genotypes associated with good colonization capacity in the highly fragmented landscape before the extinction of the populations. Evolutionary response to habitat fragmentation may have enhanced the viability of the populations, but it did not save the species from regional extinction in the face of severe habitat loss and fragmentation. These results highlight a potentially common situation in changing environments: evolutionary changes are not strong enough to fully compensate for the direct adverse effects of environmental change and thereby rescue populations from extinction.

AB  - Promoting pedestrian and bicycle traffic in the Polva region is an exemplary project in Estonia. The project is financed by the EU. A report of the initial stages of the project was completed at the end of 2005. The main planning target is a region-wide and multifunctional walking and cycling network. The project work was started in 2005. As the EU project in Polva is intended to serve as a model for other towns and municipalities in Estonia, a manual titled "Planning pedestrian and bicycle traffic network in Municipalities" was issued, based on Finland's expertise and experience. No other similar manuals to our knowledge have been issued in Europe. The Polva project is also a matching example of Finnish-Estonian cooperation.

AB  - We present results from a multidisciplinary project using lake sediment as a natural archive in combination with archaeology to investigate the earliest history of the Gladhammar mining area, southeastern Sweden. The aim was to identify and trace human impacts on the landscape, specifically in connection with settlement and metal production. Sediment records from two lakes linked to different processes in metal production were analyzed; Tjursbosjon down-slope of the mining area and Hyttegol situated downstream of an excavated blast furnace, 1.8km from the mines. The sediment analyses included multi-element geochemistry (WD-XRF), stable lead isotopes, pollen, and charcoal. Although historical documents record activities beginning in AD 1526, the archaeological study found indications that mining and metal production likely predated this period. The known historical period is well reflected in the sediment records, such as a 500-fold increase in copper, stream erosion, loss of forest cover and an expansion in agriculture. More importantly, already in the 12th-13th centuries, there was a 2- to 10-fold increase in lead, copper, and charcoal particles and evidence of erosion linked to the establishment of a blast furnace. Lead isotopes reveal a change from natural conditions to an input of lead from regional ores as early as the 9th-10th centuries. Settlement in the form of agriculture can be seen from 2000 BP. This sediment evidence of early mining or metallurgy during the 9th-15th centuries is supported by a few radiocarbon dates from the excavated mining fields, which on their own were considered as vague or improbable outliers by archaeologists.

AB  - Several studies indicate a long-term decline in numbers of different species of voles in northern Fennoscandia. In boreal Sweden, the long-term decline is most pronounced in the grey-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus). Altered forest landscape structure has been suggested as a possible cause of the decline. However, habitat responses of grey-sided voles at the landscape scale have never been studied. We analyzed such responses of this species in lowland forests in Vasterbotten, northern Sweden. Cumulated spring densities representing 22 local time series from 1980-1999 were obtained by a landscape sampling design and were related to the surrounding landscape structure of 2.5x2.5 km plots centred on each of the 22 1-ha trapping plots. In accordance with general knowledge on local habitat preferences of grey-sided voles, our study supported the importance of habitat variables such as boulder fields and old-growth pine forest at the landscape scale. Densities were negatively related to clear cuts. Habitat associations were primarily those of landscape structure related to habitat fragmentation, distance between habitat patches and patch interspersion rather than habitat patch type quantity. Local densities of the grey-sided vole were positively and exponentially correlated with spatial contiguity (measured with the fragmentation index) of old-growth pine forest, indicating critical forest fragmentation thresholds. Our results indicate that altered land use might be involved in the long-term decline of the grey-sided vole in managed forest areas of Fennoscandia. We propose two further approaches to reveal and test responses of this species to changes in landscape structure.

AB  - Predicting species' responses to habitat loss is a significant challenge facing conservation biologists. We examined the response of both European three-toed woodpecker subspecies Picoides tridactylus tridactylus and P. tr. alpinus to different amounts of dead wood in a boreal and a sub-Alpine coniferous forest landscape in central Sweden and Switzerland, respectively. Habitat variables were measured by fieldwork in forests with breeding woodpeckers (n = 10 + 12) and in control forests without breeding woodpeckers (n = 10 + 12) in the same landscape. Logistic regression analyses revealed steep thresholds for the amount of dead standing trees and the probability of three-toed woodpecker presence in both Sweden and Switzerland. The probability of the presence of three-toed woodpeckers increased from 0.10 to 0.95 when snag basal area increased from 0.6 to 1.3 m(2) ha(-1) in Switzerland and from 0.3 to 0.5 m(2) ha(-1) in central Sweden. In Switzerland, a high road network density was negatively correlated to the presence of woodpeckers (r = -0.65, p = 0.0007). The higher volumes of dead wood in Switzerland, where population trends are more positive, than in central Sweden, where the population is declining, would suggest that the volumes of dead wood in managed forests in Sweden are too low to sustain three-toed woodpeckers in the long-term. In terms of management implications, we suggest a quantitative target of at least 5% of standing trees in older forests being dead over at least 100 ha large forest areas. This corresponds about to greater than or equal to1.3 m(2) ha(-1) (basal area) or greater than or equal to15 m(3) ha(-1) (volume), still depending on site productivity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While urban planning must deal with complexity, considering planning as an activity with uncertain outcomes is challenging. This paper explores how urban planning may both proactively motivate development and adapt to change. We view such planning as co-evolutionary, and conceptualize it further by utilizing Cultural Theory, and building on a case study of infill planning in Oulu, Finland. We conclude that while the three active rationales from Cultural Theory can motivate urban development, the fourth, passive, fatalistic rationale, is also needed in order to acknowledge an uncertain future. Further, we discuss three challenges in using fatalism as a planning rationale.

AB  - In Northern Finland, the most significant land use challenges are related to bioenergy production from peat extraction and forest biomass. Increasing societal demand for bioenergy may increase production rates. However, environmental impacts of peat extraction are of increasing concern, which has led to a decline in production, thereby freeing up these areas for other uses. Using storylines for different societal futures and process-based models (PERSiST and INCA), we simulated the effect of simultaneous land use change and climate change on water quality (phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended sediments concentration). Conversion of peat extraction areas to arable land, together with climate change, may pose a risk for deterioration of ecological status. On the other hand, continuous forestry may have positive impacts on water quality. Suspended sediment concentrations in the river do not exceed water quality requirements for salmonids, but nitrogen concentrations may exceed threshold values especially during high flows. A storyline emphasizing sustainable development in energy pro-duction led to the best outcome in terms of water protection.

CP  - 7th European IFSA Symposium on New Visions for Rural Areas
AB  - This paper discusses aspects of multifunctionality emerging from a Local rural perspective. The concept is discussed on the basis of interviews and discussions with farmers and rural development groups. Multifunctionality is used in the sense of social, ecological and economic functions of farms. The study is research-in-progress and focuses on four rural areas in Sweden where agriculture has Low viability and where rural development groups are working for the persistence of farms. Semi-structured interviews, group interviews and collection of physical data of farms are methods used in order to explore the multifunctionality of farming and its contribution to rural development. Despite the declining economic importance on the national Level, agriculture may still locally contribute as an important basis for rural development. Agriculture concerns Land use and resource management, which distinguishes farming from other rural enterprises. The appearance of the Landscape, the natural and cultural values existent are important for the willingness to stay or settle in an area. The mode of agricultural production is decisive for ecological functions important for other economic activities, as well as for human wellbeing.

AB  - Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 triggered a process that saw Finland abandon its traditional policy of military non-alignment and, together with Sweden, submit an application for NATO membership. Finland's history of Finlandisation came up routinely in the parliamentary debates on a NATO application and there was a broad consensus that NATO membership would mark the end of Finlandised Finland. Accordingly, this article has a dual aim. First, it seeks to chart the main lines of post-war Finnish foreign and security policy since the late 1960s using Finlandisation and post-Finlandisation as the organising concepts. Second, it explores why, ultimately, Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022. Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it is suggested, engendered a psychosis of fear among the Finnish public, stirring collective memories of the loss of land, lives and livelihood at the hands of unprovoked Soviet aggression in the 1939-40 Winter War and the fear of history repeating itself at various tension points in Finno-Soviet relations thereafter. Strikingly, until 24 February a clear majority of politicians and the Finnish public opposed NATO membership.

KW  - mythological concepts
AB  - The article discusses the most stable and important images of stone and water in the post-war poetry of Finland in both Finnish and Swedish. Turning to these images, poets connect the modern perception of the world with mythological concepts. Each poet brings a personal attitude and national specificity to the rethinking of images. The literary sources and the continuity of artistic images are analyzed; the relationship of the "second" modernism poetry with the landscape and cultural tradition is investigated. So, some of the motives in the work of Thomas Eliot, who saw spiritualized matter in the image of a stone, are typologically similar to the poetic views of Finland's writers. Some poets get accustomed to the image of a stone, identify themselves with it (Aila Meriluoto), others, like Ralf Nordgren, who writes in Swedish, treat him contemplatively, taking the position of an outside observer. The connection of poetry with the landscape and domestic cultural tradition is investigated. Aila Meriluoto creates a number of stone images ("stone God", "stone truth", "stone humanity"). Poets following her either replenish this collection of "stones" or reject it altogether. The image of stone in Finland's poetry is inseparable from the image of water. For Eeva-Liisa Manner, the poetic connection with water is "immersion in the mirror" of the lake, the fusion of the subject with the object, the person with the world. For Bo Carpelan, "to withstand the sea" means to go through darkness, to find oneself. The image of water, like the image of a stone, evolves from serious (primary matter, a substance that gives life) to humorous (a means necessary for taking medicine). The images of stone and water in the poetry of Finland are multifaceted. Poets interpret them differently. Poets bring new shades of feelings and give new meaning to the traditional mythological attitude.

AB  - Salmon farming has been a great success story in Norway over the last 50 years, but the industry is still much disputed. Right from the start, farmers were licensed, with a limit on total production. In addition, each site was regulated according to carrying capacity. Over the years, various management measures have been used to regulate both the total production and environmental conditions, before ending up with Maximum Allowable Biomass (MAB). Since 2005, this has been the common "currency" in all regulations. Since then, the industry has experienced various new management schemes, to cater for environmental sustainability (green licenses, the traffic light system, development licenses, offshore as well as land based production), all based on MAB. The article sets out to explain why and how Norwegian authorities have chosen to regulate total production at national level, and when this failed, why they have maintained MAB as a key regulatory instrument.

AB  - Sweden and the broader region of Scandinavia have been widely praised for their efforts to develop and promote models of sustainability for the rest of the world. Swedish international architecture and urban planning firms are driven by the advantage of being able to brand their projects as Sustainable and Scandinavian. In this sense, the sustainable city has become a Swedish service to export. In order to strengthen a coherent image of Swedish sustainable urban development, in, 2007, the Swedish Trade Council initiated a marketing platform for eco-profiled companies under the name of SymbioCity. This paper seeks to explore the production of imaginaries at play in the performance of SymbioCity. It especially addresses the way in which notions of progress and a better city life were presented to Chinese audiences in the Swedish pavilion at the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010. The Swedish pavilion is here regarded as a node in the export of a wider network of Swedish sustainable urban planning services. I argue that the imaginaries that Sweden produces through activities associated with the SymbioCity underlines a view that equates progress with the notion of decoupling of economic growth and CO2-emissions. In presenting an image of decoupling as a Swedish experience possible to transfer to China, it also establishes views of progress as linear and space as static. Using the term absent presence opens up a counter narrative, which turns decoupling as a Swedish experience into a myth and raises the need for urban imaginaries based on a relational view of space.

AB  - The issue of monitoring landscape changes at the national scale has recently been investigated by a number of authors. However, there is a lack of any comparative analyses that examines the similarities and differences between different landscapes, and why these might exist. The aim of this paper is to analyze the development of intensively utilized agricultural landscapes in the Czech Republic and in Sweden, two countries with different political history, where land reforms have been particularly effective. This paper presents two case studies, both of which are located on old cultural landscapes; Honbice (244 ha) in East Bohemia and Lilla Uppakra (321 ha) in Southern Sweden. Three critical sources of data analysis were employed in this study to evaluate landscape parameters: old maps (from 1703, 1815, and 1839), and aerial photographs (from 1936, 1939, 1950, 1966, 2003 and 2004), together with field mapping of the landscape. In this study, arable land is the main subject of research, as it is the decisive landscape segment that reflects the progress of land reform. The following quantitative characteristics have been monitored: Area (P) in hectares or as a percentage of the categories, Relative frequency of landscape elements (fragmentation) in No ha(-1), Relative frequency in No ha(-1), and Average size of the elements in hectares. However, the greatest challenge in the use of the data is the combination of different types of materials, e.g. old Stable Cadastre maps (large scale cadastral maps whose accuracy can only be assumptive) and current and historical aerial photographs (medium scale, showing the real state of the landscape). The results of the study show that the differing socioeconomic systems of the modern times resulted in similar patterns of arable land use, although the changes were timed differently. The driving forces behind the socio-economic and geo-political conditions in these countries are obviously reported to be different. For example, in Sweden the economic driving forces have mainly underlain arable land changes, whereas the changes in the Czech Republic between the late 1940s and the late 1980s were principally political, resulting in a significant impact upon the physical landscape. The characteristic large-scale Soviet-type system of farming was introduced in many parts of the country with an agriculturally-based model of Russian kolkhozes. The analysis may help us to understand the patterns of long-term landscape evolution in the context of these two locations in Europe. From a methodological point of view, the results of the study are useful for other applied disciplines, e.g. geography, history, and land-use planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The politics and the underlying reasons for the recuperation of a Scandinavian wolf population are increasingly contested. According to the official policy, wolves shall be guaranteed place in the Swedish fauna. The conflict regarding whether Sweden should host a wolf population polarises between on the one hand, views and understandings as regards biodiversity and sustainable development, and on the other hand, perspectives expressing that local traditions and livelihoods are at stake as a result of wolf occurrence in the landscape. The diverging environmental imaginaries at play in the debate can be seen as constitutive of spatial indifferences. States' and nature conservation organisations' desires to implement measures understood to provide conditions for the survival of the wolf are counterbalanced by local actions groups and community residents who struggle to maintain the conditions for the conservation of summer pasturing agriculture, continued and unchanged opportunities to perform hunting with sporting dogs and other recreational activities such as mushrooming and the picking of berries. Considered not only by themselves as of high natural and cultural value, the European Union like wisely appoint that small-scale ways of farming are important to maintain for the upkeep of the landscape and the promotion of conditions guarding the survival of the values associated with these 'agri-environmental' habitats.

AB  - The European Landscape Convention indicates that assessment of different dimensions that exist in landscapes should be taken into account in planning. In this study, we first investigated ecological, cultural and social values as perceived by the local people in a highway-planning process in Sweden. Next, we explored which factors influenced the local people's participation in the road-planning process. We used questionnaires, planning documents and the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the relations between different factors and local people's participation in the planning process. The results showed that people presumed the ecological values in the landscape to be adversely affected by the new road, while the social values would remain the same. Landowners had heard of the participatory-process, but few participated. Those who lived within 300m of the road were more active in the planning process than people living further away. The findings suggest that people living within a few hundred metres of the road should be treated as key stakeholders in the planning process. The involvement of other stakeholders, and when in the public participation process stakeholders should be involved, is also discussed.

AB  - During the past twenty years, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway) have introduced a range of measures to reduce losses of nitrogen (N) to air and to aquatic environment by leaching and runoff. However, the agricultural sector is still an important N source to the environment, and projections indicate relatively small emission reductions in the coming years.
   The four Nordic countries have different priorities and strategies regarding agricultural N flows and mitigation measures, and therefore they are facing different challenges and barriers. In Norway farm subsidies are used to encourage measures, but these are mainly focused on phosphorus (P). In contrast, Denmark targets N and uses control regulations to reduce losses. In Sweden and Finland, both voluntary actions combined with subsidies help to mitigate both N and P.
   The aim of this study was to compare the present situation pertaining to agricultural N in the Nordic countries as well as to provide recommendations for policy instruments to achieve cost effective abatement of reactive N from agriculture in the Nordic countries, and to provide guidance to other countries.
   To further reduce N losses from agriculture, the four countries will have to continue to take different routes. In particular, some countries will need new actions if 2020 and 2030 National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD) targets are to be met. Many options are possible, including voluntary action, regulation, taxation and subsidies, but the difficulty is finding the right balance between these policy options for each country.
   The governments in the Nordic countries should put more attention to the NECD and consult with relevant stakeholders, researchers and farmer's associations on which measures to prioritize to achieve these goals on time. It is important to pick remaining low hanging fruits through use of the most cost effective mitigation measures. We suggest that N application rate and its timing should be in accordance with the crop need and carrying capacity of environmental recipients. Also, the choice of application technology can further reduce the risk of N losses into air and waters. This may require more region-specific solutions and knowledge-based support with tailored information in combination with further targeted subsidies or regulations.

AB  - This paper discusses how Finnish tourism experts such as tourism entrepreneurs, destination management organizations (DMOs), development project personnel, and third-party organizations explain and shape the smartness of tourism destinations in Finland. We especially explore how the experts view the nexus of smartness and the experiences of tourists. The method used in this research is qualitative inductive content analysis. The preliminary findings show that the destinations aim to provide sustainable experiences with a balance between physical and digital services. However, the conditions such as scant mobility services and sometimes harsh nature conditions set challenges to developing smart tourism experiences. Smartness is still seen as a way to improve different aspects of social, cultural, and ecological sustainability.

AB  - Current urban planning for sustainability is gradually shifting from car-based to proximity ideals. However, when concretized in regular planning thinking and practice, the latter ideal becomes contested and complex. This paper explores sustainable accessibility and how urban planners understand, seek to operationalize, and integrate the concept in their planning practices; we consider what planners hope to achieve in this process and the tensions they experience in doing so. The data, collected through semi-structured, focus-group interviews (workshops) with 35 planners in three Swedish municipalities, were subjected to thematic qualitative analysis. Urban planners' interpretations of sustainable accessibility form five recurrent themes: the importance of cross-sectoral approaches in planning; the need for urban land-use densification; measures to shift the transport mode balance in favour of walking, cycling, and public transit; facilitating proximity to everyday activities; and planning in accordance with citizens' rights to access basic services. Although there is overall agreement on these themes, discussing how the related policies should be implemented reveals several tensions, for example: city centre densification could reinforce gentrification, resulting in displacement and increased travel; tension regarding to what extent and where car use should be reduced; trade-offs between the needs of different groups; and accounting for quality and functionality factors when stressing the importance of proximity to services. In conclusion, disagreements arising when implementing sustainable accessibility goals relate in many ways to social considerations and to the socio-spatial distribution of resources.

AB  - Agriculture is a minor contributor to local economies in European mountain and fjord areas where tourism is predominant; however, it is essential to maintain the agricultural landscape and other important nonmarket functions of mountain agroecosystems. Policy-makers have aimed to support agriculture in these areas, but farmers' perspectives are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze (1) the main characteristics of livestock farming systems and the recent changes they have undergone, (2) farmers' perceptions of different functions of agriculture, (3) farmers' goals, and (4) the relationships among these elements in order to support more targeted policy-making in fjord and mountain areas in Scandinavian countries. We collected data from 27 farms and conducted univariate and multivariate (principal components and cluster) analyses. Most recent changes in farming have been related to improving working conditions and increasing tourist activity. According to the farmers, the main nonmarket functions of agriculture were (1) maintaining cultural heritage and rural development, (2) delivering environmental services, and (3) promoting traditional agriculture. The farmers' primary goals were (1) innovating for better farming, (2) improving the family's quality of life, and (3) achieving economic objectives. We identified 2 clusters of farmers based on divergent perceptions of rural development and the goal of improving the family's quality of life. These results point to the importance of integrated policies that address agricultural, environmental, and rural development together and take into account farmers' diverse perceptions and goals.

AB  - Anthropogenic stocks are increasingly seen as potential reserves for secondary resources, which has led to a rapid development in research of urban metabolic systems. With regard to buildings and their associated material stocks and flows, one of the most critical shortcomings in the state-of-the-art is the knowledge gap for drivers, dynamics, patterns and linkages that affect the urban metabolism. This paper is premised on the idea that urban planning stirs up these material flows, so it should also adopt their sustainable management on its agenda. It presents an approach that highlights the intertwined nature of changing urban morphology and building material stocks and flows in space and time. An analytical framework, based on the principles of material flow analysis, is provided for an integrated, spatiotemporal study of urban morphology and urban metabolism of buildings, using building and plot data as the input and identifying internal processes of the urban metabolism as the output. The identified processes include greenfield development, infill construction, building replacement and shrinkage, each of which can be expected to have tangible yet very different material and environmental consequences in the form of embodied materials and CO2. The use of the framework is demonstrated with a case study in the Finnish city of Vantaa in 2000-2018. The case study shows patterns pertaining to a growing city unrestricted by geographic or historic factors, manifested as vast greenfield developments and replacement of a notably young building stock. As sustainability may soon call into question both these strategies, uncovering the material consequences of a city's past urban (re)development strategies lay the foundation for using the presented approach proactively in planning support, in pursuit of more circular economy-based and low carbon cities.

AB  - Finnish artists depicted Lapland as a frontier. The position of the Lappish landscape as a part of the Finnish landscape painting tradition is explored through a framework based on art and cultural history as well as humanistic and cultural geography. Paintings from three historical periods are analyzed: the early and later period of Finland as an autonomous Russian Grand Duchy (1809-1917), the first decades after the independence of Finland (1917-1939) and the Second World War (1939-1945). Lapland is today the borderline of leisure and work and the frontier of Finnish and Sami cultures. Earlier Lappish landscapes were places of Sami nomadism and Finnish farming, which can be seen in the Lappish landscape paintings from the 1890s to 1920s. Finnish art tradition, however, was not ready to accept Lapland, the northern frontier, as a part of Finland. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s the meaning of the northern borderline grew and Lapponism, the golden years of Lappish landscape and tourism, began. During the Lapponism period there were few paintings depicting Sami culture, because the Sami were thought to be primitive or Mongolian, and were not accepted as part of Finnish culture.

AB  - Although radioactive contamination of agricultural land may require food production to cease, in many situations food contamination can be kept below the intervention limits through application of countermeasures. However, the radiological benefits of these measures may be accompanied by negative impacts on the environment. The aim of this work was to assess the impacts of selected countermeasures on water quality via losses of soil and phosphorus in river catchments in Scotland and Finland. Four countermeasures, suitable for different levels of radioactive deposition, were studied: deep ploughing, skim and burial ploughing, changes in the feeding of livestock and cessation of production. The assessments were performed using a deterministic mathematical simulation model capable of estimating the impact of changes in management practices and land use on the hydrology and on soil and phosphorus losses from land to water. Skim and burial ploughing had the least impacts. Deep ploughing generally reduced phosphorus losses but had variable effects on soil loss, which depended on the erodibility of the subsoil. Changes in the dairy feeding regime from roughage-dominated (local grass production) to more concentrates (local cereal production or imported) had variable impacts, depending on the local agricultural systems and management practices. The worst impacts on erosion and phosphorus losses may occur where large areas of grassland are converted to cereal production. Cessation of agricultural production resulted in large (50-90%) reductions in soil and phosphorus losses. The most recommended of the assessed countermeasures is skim and burial ploughing, but its wider use depends on the availability of specialized technical equipment.

AB  - Climate change and habitat degradation due to land use are the key factors threatening biodiversity. It is important to study both the separate and joined effects of climate warming and land use on biodiversity. In this work long-term population changes of southern boreal forest birds were studied in relation to climate change and direct habitat alteration due to forestry. The study was based on annually repeated bird censuses in 23 consecutive years (1993-2015) in a managed forest landscape. Results were compared with population changes in protected areas where logging is not allowed. During the study period, total bird density declined by 18 % with a change in the bird community composition. Out of the 12 most abundant species seven showed a significant negative trend and only one species a positive trend. Population declines could be connected with the direct alteration of habitat as a consequence of forestry or with the effect of climate change in the case of those species which declined also in protected areas. The increased species are abundant across Europe in human-modified habitats. Due to habitat alteration and climate warming, specific characteristics of southern boreal forest bird communities are changing with communities representing a pattern towards global homogenization. Thus, habitat alteration strengthens the negative effects of climate change.

AB  - In Tysfjord Municipality, North Norway, written sources mention Sami farms in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The farms had a mixed economy, with an emphasis on agriculture, fishing, hunting and gathering. On some of these farms there are documented settlement mounds. Minor excavations have been carried out on several of these archaeological sites. A pollen sample has also been taken from one of these locations. By using radiocarbon dating and artefact analyses it is possible to date the settlement mounds back to the Early Middle Ages. The establishment of these cultural monuments documents a change in the economy, with animal husbandry becoming more important. During the Middle Ages, cultivation of barley arose as a new element of the economy. The article addresses the question of whether this change in the economy can be linked to a Sami or a Norwegian population.

AB  - This article analyses four main models of participation in Swedish natural resource management and assesses strengths and weaknesses of one model (participation in physical/spatial planning) based on empirical studies of coastal resource conflicts in two Swedish west coast municipalities. In comparison to other administrative and planning procedures, physical planning offers possibilities to coordinate land and water management across sectors and resources and to broaden stakeholder participation. Local influence on coastal management increases with participation beyond the statutory minimum requirements, although management frameworks and practice of participation need to be developed further. Besides educating professionals and experimenting with combinations of existing procedures, in the long run an adaptation of legislation to the requirements of integrated and sustainable coastal management will be necessary.

AB  - It is now widely recognized that stakeholder interaction and dialogue is essential to improve decisions about and awareness of climate change. The term 'stakeholder' is broad and researchers and practitioners may have interrelated and contrasting views on who is a stakeholder or who is (or should be) responsible for adaptation to climate change. To engage stakeholders in research or other projects on adaptation thus requires a careful mapping of the stakeholder landscape and identification of relevant actors at different levels. Through a case study approach, based on studies of two Swedish urban regions, Stockholm and Gothenburg, this paper proposes a systematic method to analyse and identify roles and responsibilities in the stakeholder landscape. The initial mapping exercise was complemented by participatory studies of local and regional stakeholders' perceptions of who is, or should be, involved in adaptation and their significance for climate change adaptation in the respective regions. The results indicate the value of careful stakeholder analysis for sustainable, effective, planned adaptation that is flexible, but also systematic enough to fulfil practical and scientific requirements for the study and advancement of ongoing adaptation processes and implementation.

AB  - A comparison of a Norwegian and two Canadian management plans reveals that most of the measures in the Norwegian plan were put into practice, whereas the Canadian plans did not result in the implementation of any new measures. This paper applies implementation theory to explain the different results. First, there is a striking difference in the leadership of the two governments and the way they organized for the planning. The Norwegian government led the process in a top-down manner and tried to apply a "whole-of-government" approach. The Canadian government delegated the entire task to the regional branches of one ministry alone. The different roles taken may be explained by different political and economic contexts that create different motivations for the governments to engage. Second, there were different ways of deciding when conflicts arose. The Norwegian coalition government negotiated internal compromises in the form of package deals. In Canada, the collaborative planning based on consensus concealed disagreements in high-level statements and pushed concrete solutions forward to later action planning that never occurred. These processes reflect different national policy styles and resulted in policy designs that created a very different impetus for implementation. The analysis demonstrate how theory-driven case-study methodology can lead to cumulative results.

AB  - Our paper presents a comparison of historical data concerning the distribution of forest communities in the Sowie Mountains in southwestern Poland in 1968-71 with material collected by the authors between 2009 and 2013. The analyses were performed using geographic information system software. The archival vegetation maps were digitized, and the layer of the current distribution of forest communities was applied afterward. Archival data indicated that, in the study area, spruce monocultures of anthropogenic character predominated, occupying 90% of forest area. The obtained results suggest that regular forest management conducted within the study area has surprisingly contributed to an increase in the area of forest communities of the Querco-Fagetea class from 766 to 1,579 ha (more than 100%) over the last 45 years. The largest rise in the area of studied communities was observed on meso-oligotrophic habitats, and was reflected in the increase of the area of acidophilous beech forests, representing Luzulo luzuloidis-Fagetum association (habitat 9110 protected in the European Union), from 168 ha to 1,064 ha. There was a minor decrease in the area of submontane riparian forests Carici remotae-Fraxinetum (habitat 91E0); the area of mesotrophic beech forests Galio odorati-Fagetum (habitat 9130) seems to be stable. Approximately 72% of deciduous forests in the study area have retained their spatial cover for 45 years.
   The newly created forest communities are deprived of a number of essential elements of the structure, primarily dead wood, including lying trunks and trees. The lack of these features does not allow us to assess the status of these ecosystems as entirely satisfactory. However, the possibility of converting Picea abies monocultures in deciduous forests of the Querco-Fagetea class under regular forest management should be considered beneficial to the conservation status of forest ecosystems of mountain areas of Central Europe.

AB  - World Heritage Sites (WHSs) are motivated by such diverse reasons as heritage celebration, alarm calls, tourism branding and marketing and place making. Irrespective of the primary motivation for their creation, WHSs are often used to develop tourism based on cultural and natural resources of international significance. Heritage conservation may or may not be in agreement with what local populations perceive as desirable development paths. We conducted a survey among the island community of Vega in Norway that received WHS status in 2004 motivated by conservation alarm, tourism marketing and place making. We examined the local population's views of the key aspects of future development and how this related to WHS status. The islanders placed high value on social and community conditions as well as heritage linked to cultural and natural resources. While a majority supported tourism based on sustainable use of heritage they also felt that WH listing should not limit development opportunities. There were differences between younger people and adults. WHS may be an effective agent of sustainable tourism development if the main goals and strategies of the WHS are clearly understood and prioritized in the local community, leave room and perhaps link to other development opportunities.

AB  - Politicization of science is often described as the process of political actors overemphasizing scientific uncertainty to cast doubt on a scientific consensus. We argue that in addition to exploiting the inherent uncertainty of science, actors resort to so-called technical and national arguments to politicize science. Applying the pragmatic sociology of Boltanski and Thevenot and the method of discourse network analysis to Finnish news media debate on forest policy (2015-2020), we analyze the different modes of valuation used by the so-called forestry coalition to defend increased logging and politicize the broad scientific consensus on its harmful environmental impacts. Technical arguments appeal to the common principles of technical efficiency, productivity and expertise, while national arguments invoke shared, cultural ideas of Finnish forestry. We conclude that pragmatic sociology carries considerable potential to improve our understanding of the broader cultural factors that lay the foundation for successful politicization of science.

AB  - Urban growth and sprawl have long put pressure on rural areas, leading to a growing zone of 'rurban areas' where a multitude of functions, urban or rural, compete for land The development is acknowlecked in European spatial planning documents, which also recomment common solutions. E.g. the spatial policy discussed and recommended in the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) emphasises the compact city concept, rural-urban linkages and conservation of nature and cultural heritage. This paper compares planning practice for rurban areas in three cases: Roskilde municipality (Denmark), Staffanstorp municipality (Sweden) and Werv-area (the Netherlands). All three areas belong to the rurban zone and are selected to exemplify pro-active planing. The analysis focuses on how the concept of compact city is Perceived and implemented, how rurban areas are managed in order to avoid further urban encroachment, and how resilient green landscapes are ensured. The results reveal significant differences in approaches, reflecting variations in the public involvement in rurban areas development, the role of different administrative levels and the use of zonation. Variation in the use of zonation encapsulates important differences between the cases: pre-zonation based on local discretion (Sweden), zonation based on national legislation and principles with little room of manoeuvre for the municipality (Denmark) and post-zonation with deliberate introduction of urban elements in rural areas and negotiations between stakeholders (the Netherlands).

AB  - To combat biodiversity loss, the European Union (EU) established a network of protected areas to be implemented by 2000, termed Natura 2000 (N2000). However, several N2000 sites remain unmapped, and various habitats remain undefined. Delayed implementation allows continued habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Targeting biogenic reefs by blue mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus), this study 1) compared blue mussel reef definitions across EU member states surrounding the North Sea and Baltic Sea, 2) scrutinized biological mechanisms underpinning the habitat definitions, and 3) provided suggestions for harmonized habitat definitions, respecting spatial and biological variation. By comparing official definitions of blue mussel reefs applied in Denmark, Sweden, The United Kingdom, and Germany, this study revealed A) decadal delay in implementation, B) reef definitions varying significantly regarding number of parameters used for identification (e.g., mussel seabed area (m2), and proportion seabed mussel coverage (%)) and the associated parameter limits (e.g., 2.500 m2, and 30%, respectively). Specifically, parameter limits for identification of reefs range between 1 and 10,000 m2 for mussel area and between 5% and 30% seabed mussel coverage. The study failed to identify biological mechanisms justifying this variation. Variable habitat definitions, unjustified by biological and spatial variation, may result in uneven protection levels across borders, potentially compromising connectivity of the N2000 network. To avoid this scenario, our study highlights the need for compatible biogenic reef definitions reflecting spatial and biological properties and suggests moving from protection of individual reefs to protection of areas where habitat forming blue mussels are regularly occurring.

AB  - Gogland Island, located in the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea, was densely populated in the past but has been nearly abandoned since the Second World War. The self-restoration of wildlife takes place there. Recent research on the island aimed to evaluate the conservation value of this process. It was expected that the island would demonstrate a standard for the perfect state of protected areas of the boreal zone of Europe. The island has been overgrown with forests; open areas occupy insignificant parts and tend to shrink. Picturesque landscapes have been formed, but the conservation value of these areas are questionable as the biodiversity is rather low there. They contain "empty forest" that is partly impassable. The island demonstrates that to achieve the maximum effect for biodiversity conservation, the abandonment of land without any management would be insufficient. The fate of the island partly supports the concept of Pleistocene rewilding: a mosaic of forests and meadows, maintained by ungulates, should be considered a normal state of environments.

AB  - Pollen and macrofossil samples from six archaeological sites in Hordaland in western Norway were analysed to gain an overview of the onset and development of agriculture and land-use practices in the region. Samples from soil profiles covering the time-period 7000 cal. BCE to cal. 1200 CE were analysed. The results show that agricultural practices were in effect at the latest from the Late Neolithic (2300-1800 cal. BCE) or the Early Bronze Age (1800-1200 cal. BCE) at all sites and that different forest types were cleared and converted for farming. Hordeum vulgare was cultivated and animal husbandry existed. Plant macrofossil remains and pollen support and complement each other and indicate that the first period of agriculture did not have a pronounced effect on the vegetation around the sites. Both a kind of shifting cultivation and more permanent cultivation took place in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, whereas permanent cultivation with an increased emphasis on livestock and increased opening of the vegetation is indicated from the Late Bronze Age with further intensification in the Iron Age. The study demonstrates the potential of on-site analysis from archaeological sites in elucidating past land-use practices and the development of agriculture.

AB  - Logging is considered the most important threat to species in boreal forests. In contrast to eastern Canada, where most boreal forests remain largely untouched, in Fennoscandia it is possible to assess the cumulative, long-term effects of intensive forestry on wildlife, But harvesting of stands is rapidly changing Canadian boreal forests, which represent an important proportion of the world's boreal forests. We show that Fennoscandia and eastern Canada present striking similarities in terms of forest-age structure, natural-disturbance regime, and structure of bird assemblages, and we provide an assessment of the long-term effects of forestry on eastern Canadian birds of the boreal forest. We used life-history traits from habitat, nesting site, and geographical range to calculate an index of sensitivity to changes induced by modern forestry for boreal species of each region. Tropical migrants commonly found in eastern Canadian boreal forests have life-history trails that are not threat factors in relation to changes caused by modern forestry. Therefore, the general belief that tropical migrants in North America are more sensitive to landscape changes than those in Europe may not hold for species found in the boreal coniferous forests of eastern Canada. Nine Fennoscandian species present high levels of sensitivity, and at least eight eastern Canadian species are of similar concern, In both regions, most of the sensitive species are resident cavity nesters. Given the important similarities between the two regions, the northern expansion of commercial forestry in eastern Canada is likely to result in the significant decline of several resident species, as has occurred in Fennoscandia.

AB  - Livestock grazing is the dominant land use in the remaining seminatural grasslands in Europe. Abandonment of grasslands and, conversely, intensified grazing by livestock have been suggested as possible causes for the widespread population declines of many farmland birds, although the direct impact of grazing on farmland birds is poorly known. Here, we use a comprehensive, long-term data set (20 pastures surveyed over five years) to test the effects of changes in grazing intensities in seminatural dry pastures on between-year variation of the farmland bird community, functional groups of species, and individual species. Bird communities in all 20 seminatural pastures showed a low degree of temporal variability (Kendall's coefficient of concordance on ranked abundances: mean W = 0.72, range = 0.58-0.89). Community variability was not significantly related to site area, grazing pressure, vegetation structure, or adjacent habitat composition. However, analyses of functional groups of species categorized according to body mass and breeding diet showed that different species subsets had differential responses to between-year changes in grazing pressure (as reflected by changes in grass height). Local extinction and recolonization of ground-feeding insectivorous bird species were affected by yearly changes in grazing pressure, but there was no effect of grazing on ground-feeding species that fed on a mixed diet or on species that foraged in trees and shrubs. In general, large insectivores (> 30 g) preferred moderately grazed pastures, and small insectivores (less than or equal to 30 g) preferred pastures with intensive grazing pressure. We propose that Current intensive grazing should be relaxed (i.e., by reducing the number of stock per hectare or by within-season rotational grazing) so that with a given stock size, larger areas of seminatural dry pastures could be grazed. This would decrease the rate of habitat loss and conserve a larger part of the farmland bird community breeding in this habitat.

T2  - CRAYFISH IN EUROPE AS ALIEN SPECIES: HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION
LA  - English
CP  - Workshop on the Introduction of Alien Species of Crayfish in Europe
AB  - The noble crayfish, Astacus astacus, is the only native species in the Baltic and Nordic countries. Crayfish plague struck the native stocks in the various countries under consideration during the period 1890-1971 and reduced crayfish abundance and distribution. Later, man made pollution and habitat changes have also reduced both crayfish production and the potential for crayfish production. Many of the remaining stocks of noble crayfish in Norway, Sweden, and Finland result from stocking into new areas during this century. To substitute the loss of the noble crayfish, the crayfish plague resistant, North American, signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, was introduced into Sweden in 1960. Later the signal crayfish was introduced into Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Denmark. The narrow-clawed crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus, has expanded, due to a combination of stocking and further natural dispersion, from its former area of distribution in southeastern Europe, and is now found in Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and Denmark. The North American, introduced, spiny-cheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus, has expanded widely from the first introduction in the Oder River in Germany and it has recently invaded Lithuanian rivers and lakes. At present, Norway and Estonia are the only countries without introduced crayfish. The interest for conservation of the noble crayfish has increased in all Nordic and Baltic countries and measures are planned and partly implemented to improve protection of remaining stocks and restore former crayfish localities. The expansion of the introduced North American crayfish species do, however, represent a threat since they both out-compete the noble crayfish and are carriers of the crayfish plague fungus. Also the expansion of the more competitive European narrow-clawed crayfish represent a threat to the native crayfish. Present catch of noble crayfish from the wild, in the Baltic and Nordic countries, is less than 200 tons, compared to historic records of more than 2000 tons.

AB  - The present study investigated differences in road traffic culture in Norway and Turkey. Differences in non-transport accidental risk perception and risk willingness were also examined. An additional aim was to scrutinise differences in how these constructs predict speeding and rule violations in the two countries. The results are based on a questionnaire survey conducted in samples of Norwegian (n = 247) and Turkish (n = 213) road users. Culture was operationalised by an instrument of communication by symbols in road traffic and fatalistic attributions of road traffic accidents. The results showed that Turkish road users reported more fatalistic beliefs and focused more on written information and sounds in road traffic. These road users were more willing to take risks and reported greater non-transport accidental risk perception. Norwegian drivers put greater emphasis on oral and visual traffic information. Norwegians also reported more extroverted orientations in traffic. The cultural variables were found to be relatively weak predictors of speeding and rule violations in both countries, but somewhat stronger predictors in Turkey. Fatalism was the most important predictor of risky driving in Turkey, where, in contrast, a visual road traffic orientation was the strongest predictor of reduced risk behaviour in road traffic.

AB  - Analysing international forestry congresses and (by way of example) the exploration of Northern Norway and Finland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the article examines the changing conditions of natural resource management in the Baltic and North Sea regions. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, the overall increasing consumption of wood and the advancing timber frontier in Northern Europe questioned the Western European perception of Northern Europe as possessing inexhaustible woodlands. At the same time, the expanding railway network in Central Europe overran traditional (local) concepts of sustainable forest management. Since 1873, at international congresses, experts have debated the consequences of these spatial changes for the future prospects of forestry. On the one hand, pessimistic voices warned about a coming worldwide shortage of timber. On the other hand, optimistic statements saw the railway as a solution, as it allowed for timber to be transported wherever rails were laid. In the countries of the Baltic and North Sea regions, state authorities, as well as forestry academies, took up the debate and tried to improve their knowledge of accessible forest resources, for instance by sending expeditions to the woodlands of Northern Europe. The expanding railway network as well as the accumulation and cross border circulation of new knowledge about forest resources led to an ongoing process of resealing sustainability: forestry experts continuously tried to keep in step with the changing spatial conditions of forestry planning (timber frontier, railway network) and at the same time fostered these changes. Experts suggested and advocated either spatial limits - for instance laws for regional forest protection or - further spatial extensions - such as new railway lines or channels in - order to shape the spatial framework of future forest management.

AB  - In Norway, as in many other countries, rural and farm tourism is becoming an important activity for promoting the vitality and sustainability of rural communities. This paper focuses on the analysis of visitors to Norwegian farms, which offer various tourism activities and services. The countryside has increasingly become a place of consumption and recreation, and as such, farm tourism is part of the shift in the economic base of rural societies. Moreover, in building appreciation for the distinctive features of local places and people, farm tourism represents a counter-trend to homogenisation and mass tourism. In this paper we focus on the Norwegian domestic market. Based on data from ten representative national Norwegian surveys conducted by Synovate Norway between 1991 and 2007, our analysis shows significant increases in the proportion of the population visiting farm tourism enterprises since 1991. In addition to describing who the visitors are, the paper also characterises potential visitors within the domestic tourism market.

AB  - One of the most important measures adopted in the new biodiversity-oriented forestry in Sweden is to increase the quantity of coarse woody debris (CWD) in commercially managed forests, by leaving existing dead trees as well as ensuring input of new dead trees. We have used a simulation model in order to predict the quantity of CWD of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in forest landscapes subject to different management regimes. It is shown that in an average, managed forest landscape in Sweden, where the management regimes are changed in order to follow the current requirements for certification by FSC, the amount of CWD will be more than doubled, but it will take more than 100 years to reach the-new level. The increase in the amount of CWD will first be recognised for hard (less decayed) CWD and mainly in young, newly cut stands. Leaving forests unmanaged, retaining living trees and decreasing the destruction of CWD at final cutting, and not removing naturally dying trees are all measures that have a strong positive influence on the amount of CWD.

AB  - We applied a multiobjective spatial heuristic algorithm in a landscape area of 10 000 ha in eastern Finland, to select forest stands that would best complement the existing reserves in terms of achievement of conservation objectives while minimizing costs. Several non-spatial and spatial objectives for quality, area, and spatial distribution of forests were defined in cooperation with forest managers. Furthermore, existing reserves were pre-selected. The cost of each stand was calculated on the basis of the economic value of forest land and timber. The algorithm calculated cost-benefit ratios for the stands on the basis of how well each stand fulfilled the non-spatial and spatial objectives and at what cost. In every cycle, the algorithm selected the stand with the best cost-benefit ratio. A comparison between solutions, one without and three with differently weighted spatial objectives, showed that the network of selected stands was more clustered with than without spatial objectives. The use of the spatial objectives increased costs and the area slightly, and the non-spatial objectives were met almost equally in all solutions. The network of selected stands in one 2 100 ha sub-region was more clustered when stands were selected from the whole region rather than only from that sub-region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - More sustainable management of phosphorus requires comprehensive understanding of phosphorus stocks and flows. With the purpose of shedding light on the possibilities for an increased level of recirculation of phosphorus in Sweden, phosphorus flows entering and exiting biomass production sectors were quantified along with waste flows, that is, flows that are not currently utilized in biomass production. Relevant waste flows were also characterized in terms of phosphorus concentration, plant availability, contamination and geo-spatial distribution. The theoretical recirculation potential of phosphorus in Sweden was then estimated. The results indicate that there is a large potential for making phosphorus management more circular, especially regarding the utilization of phosphorus in sewage sludge as well as wood ashes from the forestry sector. Moreover, there is a large amount of phosphorus in mining waste that could potentially be used for fertilizer production. It is concluded that the amount of phosphorus in flows fit for recirculation in forestry could more or less balance today's output. In agriculture, however, recirculation can only sufficiently replace imported mineral phosphorus at current demand if the phosphorus in mining waste is utilized. Thus, if the goal is to replace all of the mineral phosphorus, the agricultural sector also has to become much more efficient in its phosphorus usage.

AB  - Background: Red deer (Cervus elaphus) have been an important human resource for millennia, experiencing intensive human influence through habitat alterations, hunting and translocation of animals. In this study we investigate a time series of ancient and contemporary DNA from Norwegian red deer spanning about 7,000 years. Our main aim was to investigate how increasing agricultural land use, hunting pressure and possibly human mediated translocation of animals have affected the genetic diversity on a long-term scale.
   Results: We obtained mtDNA (D-loop) sequences from 73 ancient specimens. These show higher genetic diversity in ancient compared to extant samples, with the highest diversity preceding the onset of agricultural intensification in the Early Iron Age. Using standard diversity indices, Bayesian skyline plot and approximate Bayesian computation, we detected a population reduction which was more prolonged than, but not as severe as, historic documents indicate. There are signs of substantial changes in haplotype frequencies primarily due to loss of haplotypes through genetic drift. There is no indication of human mediated translocations into the Norwegian population. All the Norwegian sequences show a western European origin, from which the Norwegian lineage diverged approximately 15,000 years ago.
   Conclusions: Our results provide direct insight into the effects of increasing habitat fragmentation and human hunting pressure on genetic diversity and structure of red deer populations. They also shed light on the northward post-glacial colonisation process of red deer in Europe and suggest increased precision in inferring past demographic events when including both ancient and contemporary DNA.

AB  - Hydrological change is a central part of global change(1-3). Its drivers in the past need to be understood and quantified for accurate projection of disruptive future changes(4). Here we analyse past hydro-climatic, agricultural and hydropower changes from twentieth century data for nine major Swedish drainage basins, and synthesize and compare these results with other regional(5-7) and global(2) assessments of hydrological change by irrigation and deforestation. Cross-regional comparison shows similar increases of evapotranspiration by non-irrigated agriculture and hydropower as for irrigated agriculture. In the Swedish basins, non-irrigated agriculture has also increased, whereas hydropower has decreased temporal runoff variability. A global indication of the regional results is a net total increase of evapotranspiration that is larger than a proposed associated planetary boundary(8). This emphasizes the need for climate and Earth system models to account for different human uses of water as anthropogenic drivers of hydro-climatic change. The present study shows how these drivers and their effects can be distinguished and quantified for hydrological basins on different scales and in different world regions. This should encourage further exploration of greater basin variety for better understanding of anthropogenic hydro-climatic change.

AB  - Land border tourism in China serves as a pillar industry in local economic development and is an important sector for international cooperation. This paper aims to fill the gap in the spatial pattern of land border tourism resources in China using geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial statistical methods. The pattern was analyzed from the aspects of numerical features, spatial variance, and spatial association at different spatial scales. The results show that 3341 land border tourism resources in China reveal significant clusters and outliers at both the prefectural and county scales, offering useful information for the management of tourism resources. Physical factors, cultural diversity, regional policies, the relationships between neighboring countries, and public facilities are shown to be the main factors influencing the patterns. It is suggested that the government should adjust its management policies based on the characteristics of local resources, conduct combinatorial development of different types of resources, strengthen the cooperation domestically and internationally, improve public facilities, and protect the local environment and ethnic culture.

AB  - Environmental impacts from food consumption are dominated by the consumption of livestock products. Changes in consumption patterns are necessary to reduce these impacts. Information is a policy instrument that can influence consumers to make more sustainable choices, as well as increasing awareness of the problem and hence creating acceptance for financial policy instruments, e.g. taxes. Environmental studies of livestock often focus on greenhouse gas emissions. Although the carbon footprint of meat correlates with several other impact categories, there is a risk of conflicts with categories such as biodiversity loss, pesticide use and animal welfare. In an interdisciplinary project, a consumer guide was developed to assist Swedish consumers and food professionals at retail level in making less environmentally harmful meat choices and to act as a communication tool, raising awareness of the different environmental aspects of meat production and potential conflicts with animal welfare. A series of design requirements were established for the guide as regards communication and environmental assessment from a life cycle perspective. Following these, four indicators (carbon footprint, biodiversity, use of pesticides and animal welfare) were chosen to represent the impact on the environment and animal welfare from different choices of meat and other protein sources. For each indicator, criteria were developed that placed the products included in the meat guide in one of three different groups, represented by the well-known traffic light system of red/yellow/green. This first attempt to develop a meat guide for the Swedish market has several limitations, but should provide valuable guidance to consumers and can act as a basis for discussion in the important task of decreasing meat consumption and choosing better meat alternatives.

AB  - Sustainable urbanism is seen today as one of the keys towards unlocking the quest for a sustainable society. As a central paradigm of sustainable urbanism, the eco-city is promoted by global and local policies as one of the preferred responses to the challenges of sustainable development. It is argued that eco-city strategies are expected to deliver positive outcomes in terms of providing healthy and livable human environments in conjunction with minimal demand on resources and thus minimal environmental impacts. As such, it is pertinent to examine how the eco-city model and especially its three sustainability dimensions is practiced and justified in urban planning and development at the local level. This is motivated by the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. In this light, this study seeks to answer the following two questions: What are the key strategies of the eco-city district model, and in what ways do they mutually complement one another in terms of producing the expected tripartite value of sustainability? To what extent does the eco-city district model support and contribute to the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability? To illuminate the phenomenon of the eco-city district accordingly, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology, where the empirical basis is mainly formed by urban planning and development documents in two eco-city districts-Royal Seaport, Stockholm, andWestern Harbor, Malmo, Sweden-in combination with qualitative interview data, secondary data, and scientific literature. This study shows that the eco-city district models of SRS and Western Harbor involve mainly design and technology, supported with behavioral change, as key strategies and solutions for achieving urban sustainability. Design encompasses greening, passive solar houses, sustainable transportation, mixed land use, and diversity. And technology comprises green technologies, energy efficiency technologies, and waste management systems. Design contributes to the three goals of sustainability, and technology contributes mostly to the environmental and economic goals of sustainability. Behavioral change is associated with sustainable travel, waste separation, and energy consumption. Moreover, at the core of the eco-city district model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects with respect to the benefits of sustainability. Further, this study demonstrates that while the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability are represented in eco-city district strategies on a discursive level, institutionalized planning practices show that the environmental goals remain at the core of planning, while the economic and social goals still play second fiddle. Nevertheless, new measures have recently been implemented in Western Harbor that are expected to strengthen their influence over urban development practices, whereas the Royal Seaport program mainly focuses on the environmental and some economic aspects, which is a shortcoming that should be recognized and dealt with.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. For example, nearly 80% of peatlands in southern Finland have been drained. There is thus a need to safeguard the remaining pristine mires and to restore degraded ones. Ants play a pivotal role in many ecosystems and like many keystone plant species, shape ecosystem conditions for other biota. The effects of mire restoration and subsequent vegetation succession on ants, however, are poorly understood. We inventoried tree stands, vegetation, water-table level, and ants (with pitfall traps) in nine mires in southern Finland to explore differences in habitats, vegetation and ant assemblages among pristine, drained (30-40 years ago) and recently restored (1-3 years ago) pine mires. We expected that restoring the water-table level by ditch filling and reconstructing sparse tree stands by cuttings will recover mire vegetation and ants. We found predictable responses in habitat structure, floristic composition and ant assemblage structure both to drainage and restoration. However, for mire-specialist ants the results were variable and longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the success of restoration since these social insects establish perennial colonies with long colony cycles. We conclude that restoring the water-table level and tree stand structure seem to recover the characteristic vegetation and ant assemblages in the short term. This recovery was likely enhanced because drained mires still had both acrotelm and catotelm, and connectedness was still reasonable for mire organisms to recolonize the restored mires either from local refugia or from populations of nearby mires.

AB  - 16% of the Bavarian State forests consist of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands, which are critical from the ecological point of view and are very susceptible to abiotic and biotic damages.
   With regard to nature-orientated forest management one aim is to transform pure needle monocultures into stands with deciduous tree species. Mainly, it is previewed to see if it increases the stand structure and biological diversity. To test this hypothesis within a short research period, it was necessary to examine different stages of the conversion process. With the help of different structure elements, the differences between the conversion stages are demonstrated and discussed according to the following aspects:
   models of three-dimensional structure,
   tree species composition of the old stand compared to the young regeneration beneath a shelter, and;
   a combination of natural regeneration and artificial reproduction
   The results demonstrate a striking change within the stand structure from the monotone control areas to the conversion stands with beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) groups. The results lead to conclusions for practical silviculture.

CP  - 4th International Symposium on Ecologically Sound Fertilization Strategies for Field Vegetable Production
AB  - In 1988, the Swedish Parliament decided on a special action programme for improving the environmental performance of agriculture. This was a result of the attention that problems with eutrophication attracted. At that time, the measures in the action programme mostly concerned areas with intensive agriculture and coastal areas. They focused on adapting plant nutrient supply to its specific need, on limiting pollution and on increasing the share of land under green cover in winter. The action programme has since been expanded to include measures for reducing ammonia losses from agriculture as well, and it has been revised and updated twice. The agricultural measures based on the action programme contribute both to reach the goals decided in Sweden, like the environmental quality objectives, and to reach international agreements and directives.

KW  - DEMOCRACY
AB  - This article discusses how land-use planning and management can combine the aim of local development with the protection of mountain areas. The basis for this double approach comprises protected areas and the land-use element of the Municipal Master Plan according to the Nature Diversity Act and the Planning and Building Act (PBA), respectively. Case studies performed in six mountain municipalities show that the planning processes in general are performed by a combination of rationalistic and communicative rationality based on consensus and with little awareness of power structures. Today's two-part system is dominated by the interests backing protection, not only in the protected areas, but also in the buffer-zones. Though the conflicts are rather few, they nevertheless often seem deep-set and rooted in national-local power relations. We argue that a more agonistic and decentralized approach where the protection-area management is transferred to the PBA will, to a larger extent, be able to combine both use and protection and to stimulate local development in mountain municipalities.

AB  - The ecological situation in north-western Russia is very complicated. The increasing anthropogenic loads inevitably cause alterations in the aquatic ecosystems of the Gulf of Finland, often resulting in a decrease of natural biological diversity and ecosystem stability. Coastal development activities (construction of ports, mining, dredging, transportation etc.) significantly affect the environment and the functioning of coastal processes and resources. With the intensification of ship traffic, the risk of accidental oil spills increases to a dangerous degree. Certain steps are being made by the Russian government towards solving urgent environmental problems, especially in a number of highly polluted regions such as the eastern Gulf of Finland, for example, the implementation of responsibility for ecological crimes and obligatory ecological investigations which are done when anticipating construction projects. However, for keeping the system under control by means of effective and scientifically-based management, a better linkage and exchange of experience between scientists, stakeholders and legislators in the Northwest of Russia are essentially needed to work out the proper management strategies for the environmental policy-making in the eastern Gulf of Finland coastal zone.

AB  - The rise of the service industries has changed operational business environments and mixed the roles and blurred the boundaries of private and public sectors. While cooperation has become more evident and more diverse, also simultaneous cooperation and competition between different firms and the firm and the public sector, namely coopetition, is gaining an increasing importance. We consider intentional and unintentional coopetition between firms and the public sector within the service industries by using Pyha-Luosto tourism destination in Lapland, Finland, as a context of analysis. The analysis stresses, first, the challenging tension between cooperation, competition and coopetition in a tourism destination, and secondly, both strategically planned and unintended, more instinctive coopetition. In particular, the case illustrates interplay between public and private sectors, the relationship between strategic and operational levels of development work, and emphasises the role of the surrounding region in development.

AB  - A transect of profiles from the Bratamossen bog near the village of Axlarp, in the province of Smaland, southern Sweden, was investigated with respect to magnetic properties, human-impact pollen indicators and loss on ignition.  The bog is situated close to an area with clearance cairns, an indication of abandoned arable fields.  There are also graves from the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age close to the bog.  A variety of analytical methods were used to reconstruct the land-use history of this area since c.6000 C-14 years BP.  While pollen analysis was used to detect changes in vegetation, the magnetic analyses reflected how the soils in the landscape were affected by these changes.  The pollen analysis showed that the area became deforested and that forest vegetation was succeeded by pasture and arable land.  Magnetic analyses indicated soil erosion as a consequence of agricultural activity.  The conventional technique of determining the minerogenic content by loss on ignition yielded no valuable information.

AB  - This paper uses content analysis of urban planning and guiding documents to research and evaluate relative adaptation approaches by categorising and comparing relevant indicators of progress. The scope of the paper is covering the 33 coastal municipalities that experience particularly exposure to negative consequences of climate change induced sea level rise. The findings indicate that the number of municipalities that address sea level rise has increased notably (similar to 43%) based on planning documents during the past ten years (2013-2022), which supports international trends of increased attention to urban climate change adaptation. Furthermore, the content analysis qualitatively shows based on a newly developed categorization the large variation in planning documents used by municipalities in terms of purpose and approach. Lastly, a comparison of the municipalities indicates that, while there are notable differences in approach and progress, municipalities with established adaptation plans are similarly structured in terms of ambition and level of detail, and could be considered frontrunners in sea level rise adaptation work. Thus, paper provides - based on a replicable and innovative method current comparative results about progress in latest practices of planning management, relevant as a potential benchmark and/or blueprint for similar adaptation measures of urban coastal communities worldwide.

AB  - Most cross-cultural studies on management control have compared Anglo-Saxon firms to Asian firms, leaving us with limited understanding of potential variations between developed Western societies. This study addresses differences and similarities in a wide variety of management control practices in Anglo-Saxon (Australia, English Canada), Germanic (Austria, non-Walloon Belgium, Germany) and Nordic firms (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden). Unique data is collected through structured interviews from 584 strategic business units (SBUs). We find that management control structures in Anglo-Saxon SBUs, relative to those from Germanic and Nordic regions, are more decentralized and participative and place greater emphasis on performance-based pay. Comparing Germanic SBUs to Nordic ones, we find Germanic SBUs to rely more on individual behaviour in performance evaluation, whereas Nordic SBUs rely more on quantitative measures and value alignment in employee selection. We also observe numerous similarities in MC practices between the three cultural regions. The implications of these findings for theory development are outlined.

AB  - Conservation planning studies at small scales such as forest stands and below are uncommon. However, for retention forestry, developed during the last two decades and with current wide and increasing application in boreal and temperate regions, the need for cost-effective selection of individual trees is evident. In retention forestry certain trees are left at final harvest to promote flora and fauna. There is also a scarcity of studies on information costs and how these relate to the cost-effectiveness of conservation. We addressed both of these issues by studying whether decisions about the retention of aspen Populus tremula L. trees can be made more cost-effectively by including information about tree characteristics. We analyzed data from 12 recently harvested stands in middle Sweden containing 131 epiphytic lichen species (a biodiversity proxy) on 360 aspen trees. We related the presence of lichen species to bark and stem attributes and used those relationships to prioritize trees for retention. We estimated the value of using different sets of survey information (lichens, tree characteristics) to select retention trees to achieve various conservation goals. Depending on species or species groups of interest, and the type of tree information being collected, the value of collecting the information is up to 20% of the total value of all potential retention trees, which, given current labor costs, allows up to four hours for planning and selecting the right trees on an average-sized clearcut. The current practice of almost randomly selecting aspen trees to retain at final harvest can be improved by adding easily collected information on tree characteristics, such as black-colored bark, slow tree growth, inclining stems and speckled bark. This can lead to attainment of a given level of a conservation goal (like maximizing the number of lichen species of conservation concern) with fewer retention trees. Inventory of tree information often can be performed quickly, and if part of the gains from using such information to guide tree selection would be spent on additional conservation efforts, this would benefit biodiversity. Studies on more organism groups and tree species are needed to increase the applicability of results. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the future, a significant proportion of Northern forests may become intensively managed through the planting of monospecific stands of native or introduced trees, and the use of multiple silvicultural treatments such as forest fertilization. Such an intensification of management in selected parts of the landscape is suggested by different zoning models, for example the Triad approach, which is under evaluation in some regions of North America. In this study, based on Fennoscandian conditions, we predicted landscape-scale extinction risks of five hypothetical model insect species dependent on fresh dead wood from Norway spruce (Picea abies), by simulating colonizations and local extinctions in forest stands. Intensified forestry applied to 50% of the spruce stands led to strongly increased extinction risks of all species during the following 150 years. For one species-the sun-exposure specialist-there were strong effects already after 50 years. The negative effects of intensive plantation forestry could be compensated for by taking greater biodiversity conservation measures in other managed forests or by setting aside more forests. This is consistent with the Triad model, which is according to our analyzes an effective way to decrease extinction risks, especially for the short-dispersing species and the species associated with closed forest. A zoning of forest land into intensive forestry, conventional forestry, and set asides may be better at combining increased timber production and maintenance of biodiversity in comparison to landscapes where all production forests are managed in the same way.

AB  - Transport policy has proven highly resistant to change despite growing environmental problems. However, in the Swedish city of Orebro, objectives and policy measures in support of ecological sustainability have successfully been introduced in urban transport policies adopted by the local government. This article explains how this 'greening' became possible. Three variables of change proved highly important to understand policy change in this case: (i) new policy ideas of sustainable transport, (ii) reorganization of the local administration and (iii) the pressure of green policy entrepreneurs. A common denominator behind all these changes was the reformation of urban transport into a political issue through discursive changes and an active involvement by elected politicians, that is, politicization. The continuing importance of politics in contemporary policy processes as complex as transport is an important lesson from this case, that is, politics still matters.

AB  - This paper describes nitrogen losses from, and the characteristics of. 35 selected catchments (112 to 2000 ha) in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Average annual losses of N in 1994-1997 ranged from 5 to 75 kg ha(-1). Generally, the lowest losses were observed in the Baltic countries and the highest in Norway. The N losses were also characterised by significant within-country and interannual variations, particularly in the Norwegian catchments. An important finding of the study is that the average nutrient losses varied greatly among the catchments studied. The main explanations for this variability were water runoff, fertiliser use (especially the amount of manure), soil type and erosion (including stream bank erosion). However, there were several exceptions, and it was difficult to find general relationships between the individual factors. For example, there was poor correlation between nitrogen losses and surpluses. Therefore, the results suggest that the observed variability in N losses cannot have been due solely to differences in farm management practices, although the studied catchments do include a wide range of nutrient application levels, animal densities and other relevant elements. There is considerable spatial variation in the physical properties (soil. climate, hydrology, and topography) and the agricultural management of the basins, and the interaction between and relative effects of these factors has an important impact on erosion and nutrient losses. In particular, hydrological processes may have a marked effect on N losses measured in the catchment stream water. The results indicate that significant differences in hydrological pathways (e.g. the relationship between fast- and slow-flow processes) lead to major regional differences in N inputs to surface waters and therefore also in the response to changes in field management practices. Agricultural practices such as crop rotation systems, nutrient inputs and soil conservation measures obviously play a significant role in the site-specific effects, although they cannot explain the large regional differences observed in this study. The interactions between agricultural practices and basic catchment characteristics, including hydrological processes, determine the final losses of nitrogen to surface waters, hence it is necessary to understand these interactions to manage diffuse losses of agricultural nutrients efficiently.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a prominent planning model that connects sustainable mobilities with land use. While this interface is crucial for sustainable development, it also requires, we argue, that all types of mobilities are considered. Therefore, this paper scrutinises how recreation and its mobilities have been studied within academic TOD literature. The review reveals a small number of studies of recreation, and by paying attention to their diverse geographical settings the scattered knowledge becomes even more apparent. Thereafter, to illustrate the consequences and situate our reading, we offer a place based critique of the TOD planning in a Swedish city. The case captures how policies silence local resources for recreation, not least by misinterpreting the modernist planning legacy. Finally, we argue that integrating recreation in the TOD model is as important as it is challenging: it requires a reconsideration of the urban ideal that TOD relies upon.

AB  - Achieving more sustainable urban freight transport is a key challenge for cities, especially with the rise of diverse urban delivery services. However, the governance of urban freight transport and urban logistics has typically been seen as the domain of the private sector. In this paper we argue for a reframing of urban logistics as a matter of concern for public authorities, and subsequently, we examine logistics as an urban governance challenge: how is urban logistics addressed by urban level authorities? The empirical basis for the paper is a study of three Norwegian cities-Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger-currently working to integrate logistics into their governance processes. These cities are currently piloting solutions, sharing experiences, and attempting to establish effective regulations and measures. Nonetheless, various institutional barriers are preventing the implementation of public governance processes for urban logistics. We emphasise the need for clarified responsibilities in the public sector and for reconciliation between different users of public space, including urban logistics actors. In conclusion, we point to key issues to be addressed by an emerging research literature on the governance of urban logistics for sustainability.

AB  - A substantial proportion of large protected areas in Norway fall within mountain parks. Traditionally, the management of these areas has been rigid and wilderness oriented. In recent years, we have experienced a shift towards more integrated perspectives on the protection of nature and regional development. Parallel to this, several rural, bottom-up regional park initiatives have emerged since 2005. The Norwegian regional parks and their strong international networks have proved to be important for new ideas of organization, collaboration and integrated management strategies for conservation and sustainable rural community development in Norway. As described in this paper, park management and research collaboration throughout Europe have influenced the Norwegian discourse of nature management and the country's research agenda.

AB  - Recycling of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a significant challenge all over the world. Waste-to-Energy generation solves the problem of MSW recycling and produces power for urban territories. In this study, the researchers implemented complex economic and ecological efficiency analyses of modern Waste-to-Energy technologies. The fundamental challenge of modern Waste-to-Energy generations is finding the balance between economics, ecology, and productivity. Thus, to assess the effectiveness of various thermal technologies, statistics from enterprises were used. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method was implemented to calculate an integral effectiveness of a particular Waste-to-Energy technological approach. Environmental and economic analysess of thermal MSW disposal technologies was carried out by selecting the data from at least 146 functioning plants in Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Thailand. The research results confirm that gasification technology was the most promising and the most environmentally and cost effective. Incineration Moving Grate technology was the least effective and attractive Waste-to-Energy technology according to the results of the environmental and economic efficiency assessments. The research results can be used for urban planning in waste recycling projects and the new energy national and municipal agenda. The research results can also be useful for municipal strategic energy and sustainable plans and programs.

AB  - Knowledge transfer between customers and managers is an important source of new ideas for innovation in the service industries. In cross-border regions, inter-cultural interactions engender but also constrain knowledge transfers between actors even when actors share similar economic and technological knowledge bases. This theme is explored through an analysis of cognitive and cultural proximity between service managers and customers from the other side in a European cross-border region where the constituent regions have broadly similar national cultures: Tornio-Haparanda on the border between Finland and Sweden. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 19 Swedish and Finnish managers of small and micro businesses serving customers from both sides were undertaken to gauge their perceptions of the impact of cultural and cognitive proximity to customers on learning interactions. The study adds to the emerging literature in this field by identifying seven elements of cognitive and cultural proximity including mentality, ways of solving problems, conservatism, shared language, focus on contextualised details, mentality, and use of similar technologies. It is also original for suggesting some the implications for the possible impacts of perceived cultural and cognitive proximity on cross-border knowledge transfer between customers and managers.

AB  - Stump storage piles created at stump extraction are stored next to the extraction clear-cuts for 2 years. These storage piles may become a trap for saproxylic insects (dependent on dead wood) if they attract many breeding individuals, whose offspring are killed at biofuel processing. Stumps in clear-cuts are also an important habitat for many species and these species could be negatively affected by habitat loss when stumps are extracted.
   In a field study, we therefore estimated the trap effect for the saproxylic beetle fauna in stump storage piles. We also estimated the habitat loss and population decrease that was the result of stump extraction. Beetle density and habitat amounts were estimated in stump storage piles, extraction clear-cuts, and ordinary clear-cuts. In each of eight (six for piles) replicates, beetles were sampled from ten Norway spruce Picea abies stumps, by means of bark sieving, in each habitat (220 stumps in total).
   Stump extraction reduced the P. abies stump volume by 76%. The concomitant decrease in beetle community abundance was 70%, a decrease from 9109 to 2692 beetles per hectare. A conservative estimate is that between 5.2% and 23.1% of the beetles "produced" at the stump extraction site were killed at stump pile removal. Our results indicated that the stump storage piles were a severe ecological trap for four individual species. However, a lower community density of beetles in stump storage piles compared to surrounding extraction clear-cuts, indicate that stump storage piles did not constitute a community-wide ecological trap.

AB  - The effects of habitat fragmentation on forest bird assemblages were analysed in 214 holm oak (Quercus ilex) remnants spread across the northern and southern plateaux of central Spain. Bird richness was highly dependent on fragment area for all species regardless of isolation, and barely affected by habitat traits. Geographical location was associated with high differences in richness of bird assemblages, which included 17 species exclusive to northern remnants and one exclusive to southern remnants. This supports the hypothesis that habitat suitability deteriorates sharply from north to south for forest birds in Spain. The species-area relationships of bird assemblages sampled in fragmented forests along a broad continental gradient (from Norway to southern Spain) showed that true forest birds only nest in woodlands > 100 ha in southern Spain, whereas the full complement of forest species occurs in much smaller fragments in central-western Europe. Loss of species that are particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation accounts for these differences between dry Spanish and mesic European woodlands. These results are explained by the low habitat suitability of Spanish woodlands, associated with the restrictive conditions for plant regeneration in the Mediterranean climate and long-standing human usage. There is, therefore, a particular need to develop management strategies that conserve birds, and probably other forest organisms, in Mediterranean regions by preventing habitat deterioration and decreases in fragment size, and by conserving all woods > 100 ha.

We present two tools which add detail on mineral potential planning: Mapping tool for regional considerations and a tool to scan conflicting interests on mineral deposit scale. A case study for the implementation of the mapping tool is provided for Northern Finland. Understanding the risks related to conflicting interests on land-use deepens the understanding of the future supply potential of mineral raw materials. It also increases the capabilities for early mitigation of disputes and conflicts and enhances the quality of planning for sustainable development on local societies.

AB  - Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs) are semi-natural farmland habitats of high nature value formed through traditional agricultural activities, such as grazing and fodder collection. The aims of this study were to 1) understand manager motivations for managing TRBs and their attitudes toward TRB conservation and 2) determine whether TRB managers differ in attitude, motivation for management, experiences or area under management depending on whether their managed TRBs are integrated or separate from their farming systems. Farmers and landowners (N=27) managing TRBs in coastal Finland were interviewed. In addition to quantitative analysis, responses were mapped with DebateGraph for inductive analysis to discern patterns amongst the two groups and to explore a series of questions related to motivations. Although area under management and farming strategy varied amongst managers, they all had a positive view toward the existential value of TRBs. A small group of "TRB entrepreneurs", whose farming strategy was based on grazing primarily rented TRBs was identified. Their farming income was dependent upon direct sale of meat and participation in agri-environmental scheme for TRB management. Desire for open landscape was the primary motivation for managing TRBs and strongly outweighed extrinsic values such as fodder production and AES. Higher TRB: farm ratio was associated with more positive attitude toward TRBs and TRB conservation. No difference was found in motivation for management between the two farmer groups. Although motivations were similar, improved and tailored extension services for TRB managers could promote their conservation management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Distributed energy systems (DESY) are used in many households as an alternative to conventional centralized energy production. While centralized energy production does offer certain advantages, there is growing interest in smaller distributed renewable energy production options. This study uses combines two different methodologies, namely life cycle assessment (LCA) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), to assess the sustainability of three energy scenarios, with the aim of finding the most sustainable combination of DESY options for a case municipality of approximately 220 inhabitants in Western Finland. The local production potentials of five renewable options: wind, small-scale hydropower, biogas, small-scale combined heat and power plants and photovoltaics (PV) were calculated after which the criteria for sustainability assessment were selected. Three scenarios were created to represent production mixes capable of meeting the electricity consumption needs of the area: 1) a non-biomass renewable energy option of wind power and hydro power, 2) hydropower combined with solar electricity and. 3) a small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) plant with solar electricity. In addition, electricity production from biogas was used to bridge the gap between consumption and production in all three scenarios when needed. The values from the sustainability criteria were calculated by using LCA software database (GaBi 6.0)-information and literature values. Then the experts of the local energy production prioritized the sustainability criteria by pairwise comparisons resulting in valuations in sustainability assessment The findings indicate that the application of two different methodologies strengthened the sustainability analysis and provided a large and relevant information base to support local decision-making in finding the optimally sustainable local DESY. In general, the results imply that scenario 1 with local hydropower and wind power has fewer negative impacts than other scenarios with PV and biomass utilization options. In the future, applying AHP in LCA may be useful in local sustain ability assessment with stakeholder participation and in weighting other than environmental aspects of sustainability.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide a system perspective on the barriers to the development of a fossil-free and thus more sustainable urban freight system and to provide insights regarding these barriers and how they impede progress. The system perspective complements earlier research, where barriers were identified in delimited parts of freight systems. Here, the urban freight system in a Swedish city is explored using an inductive and qualitative approach, according to which barriers are both detailed and categorized. This study is based on empirical data concerning the perceptions of multiple stakeholders in one system. The interrelationships between barrier categories and changes to the urban freight system are explored through management theory. This study provides a unique overview of the barriers to development in one system and insights concerning these barriers and how they impede development of the system. Ten categories of barriers are identified: technology, infrastructure, economy, knowledge, policy, goals, organization, cooperation, politics, and societal factors. The categories can be divided into four different types, which are related to each other and to the overall system in various ways, based on how they impede the development toward sustainability. Future research could advance this theoretical knowledge by continuing to study urban freight system development processes and by adding insights from other contexts, stakeholders, and theoretical areas.

AB  - The European, Canadian, and Latin American seaweed industries rely on the sustainable harvesting of natural resources. As several countries wish to increase their activity, the harvest should be managed according to integrated and participatory governance regimes to ensure production within a long-term perspective. Development of regulations and directives enabling the sustainable exploitation of natural resources must therefore be brought to the national and international political agenda in order to ensure environmental, social, and economic values in the coastal areas around the world. In Europe, Portugal requires an appraisal of seaweed management plans while Norway and Canada have developed and implemented coastal management plans including well-established and sustainable exploitation of their natural seaweed resources. Whereas, in Latin America, different scenarios of seaweed exploitation can be observed; each country is however in need of long-term and ecosystem-based management plans to ensure that exploitation is sustainable. These plans are required particularly in Peru and Brazil, while Chile has succeeded in establishing a sustainable seaweed-harvesting plan for most of the economically important seaweeds. Furthermore, in both Europe and Latin America, seaweed aquaculture is at its infancy and development will have to overcome numerous challenges at different levels (i.e., technology, biology, policy). Thus, there is a need for regulations and establishment of "best practices" for seaweed harvesting, management, and cultivation. Trained human resources will also be required to provide information and education to the communities involved, to enable seaweed utilization to become a profitable business and provide better income opportunities to coastal communities.

AB  - Animals use and select habitat at multiple hierarchical levels and at different spatial scales within each level. Still, there is little knowledge on the scale effects at different spatial levels of species occupancy patterns. The objective of this study was to examine nonlinear effects and optimal-scale landscape characteristics that affect occupancy of the Siberian flying squirrel, Pteromys volans, in South- and Mid-Finland. We used presence-absence data (n=10,032 plots of 9ha) and novel approach to separate the effects on site-, landscape-, and regional-level occupancy patterns. Our main results were: landscape variables predicted the placement of population patches at least twice as well as they predicted the occupancy of particular sites; the clear optimal value of preferred habitat cover for species landscape-level abundance is a surprisingly low value (10% within a 4km buffer); landscape metrics exert different effects on species occupancy and abundance in high versus low population density regions of our study area. We conclude that knowledge of regional variation in landscape utilization will be essential for successful conservation of the species. The results also support the view that large-scale landscape variables have high predictive power in explaining species abundance. Our study demonstrates the complex response of species occurrence at different levels of population configuration on landscape structure. The study also highlights the need for data in large spatial scale to increase the precision of biodiversity mapping and prediction of future trends.

AB  - Catchments are complex social-ecological systems involving multiple, and often competing, interests. Water governance and management regimes are increasingly embracing pluralistic, participatory, and holistic norms as a means to engage with issues of complexity, uncertainty, and value-conflicts. Integrated, participatory approaches are theoretically linked to improved learning amongst stakeholders across sectors and decision-making that is grounded in shared knowledge, experiences and scientific evidence. However, few studies have empirically examined the impacts of an integrated approach to learning and knowledge practices related to water resources. Here, a Swedish sub-catchment that has adopted such an approach in association with implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is examined. Interview-based analyses show that WFD implementation has both helped and hindered learning and knowledge practices surrounding both water planning and spatial planning. Whilst communities of practice have developed in the study area, a number of important challenges remain. These include the rigid goal-orientation of the WFD, the fragmentation of knowledge caused by an over-reliance on external consultants, as well as a lack of resources to synthesise information from multiple sources. Present results raise questions regarding the efficacy of the WFD to sufficiently enable the development of learning and knowledge practices capable of handling the complexity, uncertainties and value-conflicts facing catchments in Sweden and elsewhere.

AB  - Agrarian history and local cultural landscape dynamics have been documented through pollen analysis of a peat core within the hamlet of Yttra Berg, which is situated in an upland area of southwest Sweden. The sequence covers the last 5,000 years, from Neolithic to modern time. Wood pasturing started at 2000 b.c., followed by grazing and small-scale cultivation with 500 year cycles from 650 b.c., and permanent fields of agriculture from a.d. 1150. The area was abandoned during the period a.d. 1350-1550. Three cycles of succession related to land-use have been identified for the period 650 b.c. to a.d. 1550. Correlation with frequent clearance cairns in the area is discussed. Recessions of agriculture/settlement during the late Middle Ages and late modern time are documented. Pollen data indicate increased landscape and plant diversity since the Neolithic, closely linked to openness of the agrarian landscape. These results are important for landscape restoration.

AB  - The beginning of animal husbandry in Finland is one of the most debated topics in Finnish archaeology. For this study a total of 69 bone materials from archaeological sites in Southern, Western and Eastern Finland, dating from the Middle Neolithic to the Early Metal Period, were analysed: 52 represented identifiable animal bones. These data were complemented with those from previously analysed bone materials. A total of 19 domestic animal bones were radiocarbon-dated to determine their connection with a particular cultural period. However, 13 of them proved to belong to the historical and not the prehistoric period, emphasizing the importance of radiocarbon-dating and context awareness when interpreting prehistoric bone materials. Among the radiocarbon-dated material were the oldest dated sheep, cattle and horse bones in Finland. The oldest radiocarbon-dated domestic animal bone in Finland, from sheep or goat, derives from the Late Stone Age Kiukainen Culture site, while cattle and horse bones date to the Bronze Age. This is later than expected. However, the available material does not exclude the possibility that some animal husbandry was practised in Finland earlier. Nevertheless, domestic animal bones are rare in samples dated to the cultural periods studied, while hunting and fishing represented important subsistence activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Managing and conserving threatenedmigratory salmonid populations in large river-lake ecosystems is challenging not only because of the ecosystems' large size, but also because there is often more than one anthropomorphic stressor. The River Klaralven - Lake Vanern ecosystem, situated in Norway and Sweden, is a large, highly modified ecosystem, home to a threatened, endemic, large-bodied population of landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). With 11 dams, the salmon population has been maintained through extensive stocking and a truck and transport system for spawners. Here we review what we have learned about the salmon after 15 years of research, highlighting the major findings for each life stage. Our studies indicate that the salmon population is below carrying capacity, and we suggest measures to increase the number of spawners and downstream passage success. Habitat restoration to compensate for losses from former log-driving activities is expected to further increase carrying capacity. Re-establishing salmon in Klaralven's upper reaches in Norway, while possible, is fraught with both ecological and legislative hurdles. Substantial long-termfunding is needed to foster co-management and ensure a sustainable fishery.

AB  - The expansion of tourism to natural areas may have many kinds of effects on wildlife species. There is still a lack of adequate scientific knowledge about these impacts on fauna. We examined potential effects of ski resorts on four grouse and five mammalian species in northern Finland. We studied density data which included both late-summer and mid-winter line transect counts in 88 wildlife triangles (12 km each) within a radius of 40 kms around ten tourist destinations in northern Finland. Counts were conducted during 1989-2006 by volunteer hunters. Landscape structure data (CORINE Land Cover 2000) within the study area were analyzed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Variation in the abundances of wildlife species were assessed with general linear model. We found out that distance from a tourist destination to a transect count area was significant only for mountain hare and mustelids, in both cases, their density increased towards the ski resorts. The density of adult grouse, juvenile grouse, mountain hare and mustelids were positively correlated with the mixed forests. The density of adult grouse and juvenile grouse were positively correlated and the density of pine marten and mustelids were negatively correlated with the agricultural land. The density of studied species varied between ski resorts, the density of most species decreased to the north. Densities of species varied between years, and this highlights the importance of multi-year studies. According to our results, the distance from the ski resort does not have drastic negative effects on the studied wildlife species on this scale. The location of the ski resort and the general landscape structure around ski resort seems to affect more the density of wildlife species than the ski resort per se. Although our time period in this study was rather long, it is possible that the impacts of tourism might arise with a delay.

AB  - Environmental problems are often complex and involve fundamental value contradictions. There is a need to explore whether a well-designed process can contribute to a legitimate decision 'closure' even in the presence of value conflicts. We examine why environmentalists did not accept a compromise between industrial forestry and full conservation in the case of some forestry debates in Northern Finland and the Liperinsuo site in particular. Contradictory value positions between the environmentalists and the Finnish state forestry enterprise can only partly explain the lack of legitimacy, because past decision-making processes form specific legacies affecting even the legitimacy of current decisions and compromises. By exploring the continuum of decision-making processes from the point of view of 'opening up' and 'closing down', we identify some conditions for processes contributing to legitimate decision 'closures', including: 1) the inclusion of all the relevant participants, 2) the problems which the decision should solve are co-defined and mutually agreed on; 3) the timing of the necessary 'closing down' of the decision is mutually agreed on; 4) the processes are transparent, and 5) the decision 'closures' are not transformed from one scale to another without possibilities for participation. By nurturing these conditions through deliberate process design, capacity to legitimately 'close down' decisions in order to resolve complex and value-laden environmental conflicts will increase.

AB  - It is widely held that integrated management of ocean areas needs to be based on integrated scientific advice. Such advice crosses disciplinary and traditional sector boundaries. This paper aims to provide insight into the role of science and scientific knowledge ill a process towards integrated ocean management. It does so by exploring the organization of the process towards the integrated management plan for the Barents Sea-Lofoten area in Norway. It sheds light on the complexity of management questions in a context characterized by uncertainty and political controversy, largely concerning petroleum activity. Scientists were asked to provide a dynamic view on these issues and have delivered important material that furthers the task of policy development. However there is a, persisting lack of understanding about the consequences of human impact on the ecosystem. The paper finishes by pointing at the need for a larger societal discussion on what activities we consider appropriate, considering the limits of science to provide the knowledge base for questions that transcend the environmental domain.

AB  - To maintain the high biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands, management by grazing or mowing is needed. Given the limited resources and few remaining areas, the best management method should be used. However, only a few studies comparing the effects of mowing and grazing on grassland biodiversity exists. Therefore, the goal of the present review was to extract as much data as possible from the literature and evaluate them using a meta-analysis approach. We searched scientific and grey literature for studies comparing the effects of grazing and annual mowing on outcomes relevant for biodiversity conservation. We identified 35 relevant studies on grazing and annual mowing that provided data suitable for the meta-analysis. We found that grazing generally had a more positive effect on the conservation value of semi-natural grasslands compared to mowing, but effect sizes were generally small to moderate for most contrasts. Furthermore, effects varied across some grassland characteristics e.g. for different grassland types, with grazing and mowing having a similar effect or mowing having a more positive effect in certain cases. Our results suggest, that in most cases grazing should be the preferred management method when managing for grassland conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Union has decided to reform its agricultural policy and decouple Common Agricultural Policy support partially from production. The aim of this study is to predict the diversity effects of agricultural policy reforms in which direct aid payments are disconnected from production, and compare the outcomes with the effects of a policy in which Common Agricultural Policy support is coupled to production. The study employs a dynamic regional sector model of Finnish agriculture. The sector model predicts regional agricultural land use, numbers of livestock, stocking densities, pesticide application areas, and nutrient balances. Diversity of agricultural land use is measured by Shannon's diversity index. The results indicate that if agricultural support is independent from production, the amount of fallow land will increase considerably in the future. This will decrease the diversity of agricultural land use at landscape level, but may not be harmful at species level since green fallow has some positive effects, especially on the densities and abundance of farmland birds. Instead, the decrease in bovine animals is likely to run down biological diversity, since it simplifies crop rotation and diminishes grazing.

AB  - Climate change impacts, ageing infrastructure and the increasing imperviousness of cities all raise enormous challenges to and call for new ways of planning for sustainable urban stormwater management. Especially, closer collaboration among a diverse set of actors involved has been pointed to as critical to enable the development of holistic and flexible approaches. However, the shift towards inclusive forms of planning has been slow, and characterized by technical and institutional lock-ins. Against this background, this study scrutinizes the challenges and developments perceived as central for improving stormwater planning, and analyzes how formal and informal institutional change could contribute to enhancing sustainability in this sector. Building on an analysis of data from workshops, interviews and a survey with Swedish planners and water managers, we suggest new strategies for integrating stormwater concerns into planning processes, overcoming silo structures, fostering cocreation cultures, and securing the continuation and implementation of stormwater management through various planning stages.

AB  - Plant species richness in rural landscapes of northern Europe has been positively influenced by traditional management for millennia. Owing to abandonment of these practices, the number of species-rich semi-natural grasslands has decreased, and remaining habitats suffer from deterioration, fragmentation, and plant species decline. To prevent further extinctions, restoration efforts have increased during the last decades, by reintroducing grazing in former semi-natural grasslands. To assess the ecological factors that might influence the outcome of such restorations, we made a survey of semi-natural grasslands in Sweden that have been restored during the last decade. We investigated how plant species richness, species density, species composition, and abundance of 10 species that are indicators of grazing are affected by (1) the size of the restored site, (2) the time between abandonment of grazing and restoration, (3) the time elapsed since restoration, and (4) the abundance of trees and shrubs at the restored site. Only two factors, abundance of trees and shrubs and time since restoration, were positively associated with total species richness and species density per meter square at restored sites. Variation in species composition among restored sites was not related to any of the investigated factors. Species composition was relatively similar among sites, except in mesic/wet grasslands. The investigated factors had small effects on the abundance of the grazing-indicator species. Only Campanula rotundifolia responded to restoration with increasing abundance and may thus be a suitable indicator of improved habitat quality. In conclusion, positive effects on species richness may appear relatively soon after restoration, but rare, short-lived species are still absent. Therefore, remnant populations in surrounding areas may be important in fully recreating former species richness and composition.

AB  - The preservation of twentieth-century public art is an urgent management problem and of expanding interest for conservation. The National Public Art Council in Sweden has initiated a research project, Management of Public Building-Related Art in Public and Private Ownership. The project is being carried out in collaboration with the Swedish National Heritage Board, the Museum of Public Art, and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. The aim of the research project is to analyse and to estimate the expertise and financial resources needed for the long-term management and preservation of twentieth-century public art commissioned for government buildings, county councils, and municipalities. Another purpose of the project is to discover how national, regional, and local heritage conservation authorities cooperate in order to support the owners of public art financially or with conservation guidance. As case studies, carried out during 2011, 24 works of art were chosen. The findings showed an absence of overview, cooperation, and legal safeguard for public art. The result will help to improve future supervision and facilitate access to different kinds of resources, thus furthering the preservation of an important part of Sweden's cultural heritage.

AB  - In this paper, we report on the application of systems engineering in initiating the synthesis of a participatory planning support system (PSS) for sustainable regional planning. The systems engineering SPADE approach is applied in a model-based fashion to define and link sustainable development goals (SDGs) to regional and urban planning policies in a co-creative multi-stakeholder environment. The approach is demonstrated through a case study from the interregional climate, land-use, and transportation planning process (PAKT) in the angstrom lesund region in Norway. The work was performed using focus groups with planning stakeholders over a series of workshops to analyze, design, verify and validate the problem structure. Our study shows that the approach is useful for integrating and operationalizing the SDGs in a planning context. The methodology also brings clarity and structure to planning problems and provides a pedagogical frame to engage stakeholders in co-creative PSS synthesis. Further research is necessary to explore how structured elements may be exploited in PSS synthesis.

AB  - Within the next 30 years, two thirds of the human population will live in a city. This growing urban population requires a major shift in the way we produce and distribute food, since conventional agriculture practices are responsible for climate change, biodiversity losses, pollution of waterways, soil degradation, etc. Urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry represent one of the strategies that can contribute to climate mitigation, adaptation and development. Amongst the urban farming systems, rooftop plant factories may provide part of the solution for vegetable and fruit production in the city, while solving current problems created by existing flat roofs and saving on arable land outside the city. This article presents a study of rooftop greenhouse located on a typical warehouse in Malmo, Sweden (lat. 55.6 degrees N, long. 13.0 degrees E). The goal of the study was to investigate the effect on energy use of building a greenhouse on the roof of an existing warehouse. The study was performed by dynamic energy simulations with the computer program IDA-ICE. The results show that adding the rooftop greenhouse on the warehouse reduces total energy use compared to greenhouse and warehouse as stand-alone structures. Furthermore, the results indicate that the glazing and shading solutions are important aspects determining the energy-efficiency of the integrated system. The energy use for electric lighting is also significantly reduced by the rooftop greenhouse compared to an indoor horizontal farm of similar size illuminated by LED lamps. The main conclusion is that rooftop greenhouses offer a great potential for food production in the city with the additional benefit of reducing overall energy use of host building and greenhouse. Rooftop greenhouses are also more energy-efficient than indoor farms illuminated by LEDs, when considering all energy end-uses (heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation).

AB  - Although digital tools have expanded opportunities for various social groups to participate in biodiversity research, these tools typically assign citizens tasks that make them mere assistants of professional researchers, thus maintaining conventional power relations in research processes. Problems may arise if power asymmetries and participant expectations concerning data and participation are neglected in contested situations-for example, in conservation or natural resource conflicts. In participatory wolf monitoring in Finland, participation itself has become a power struggle. The digital participatory tool enforces strict scientific criteria for data validity and constrains possibilities for citizens to use the data produced. This situation perpetuates rather than helps resolve the persistent conflict over knowledge regarding wolves. While preparing the latest wolf management plan, Finnish wolf policy stakeholders compared the digital tool used in Finland with another tool used in Scandinavia. This comparison enabled them to envision opportunities to reorganise collaboration and share epistemic power more equally. Such alternative wolf 'data stories' could be essential in finding a way forward in this polarised situation. Wolf 'data stories' demonstrate that even subtle changes in digital designs could make participatory architectures more responsive to multiple knowledge needs. These changes need not compromise the high quality of evidence required by authorities for public decision-making. This role aligns with the growing academic interest to envision and probe alternative techno-scientific practices, especially in Science and Technology Studies.

AB  - The Norwegian state-owned Petroleum Fund's market value is more than one trillion US dollars, and the Norwegian state has become one of the world's largest stockowners. The Fund was established in 1990 and in 2006 and renamed the 'Government Pension Fund Global', as savings for future generations. What kind of values form the basis for describing the Petroleum Fund in this way? This article shows that the idea that present generations should not empty the North Sea of oil and gas without saving something for future generations has been stable since the 1970s. However, over time, the understanding of how to save has changed. More specifically experts, bureaucrats and politicians have shifted their arguments during four phases: moderation in oil extraction (1974-1983); introduction of the national wealth model (1984-1990); a financial fund for the present and the future (1991-2006); and increased income and new protests (2007-2019). These four periods show that over time the idea of weak sustainability and value commensurability have increasingly come to dominate the argumentation in public documents about the Petroleum Fund.

AB  - Maintaining enough green areas and ensuring fair access to them is a common planning challenge in growing and densifying cities. Evaluations of green area access typically use metrics like population around green areas (within a certain buffer), but these do not fully ensure equitable access. We propose that using systematic and complementarity-driven spatial prioritization, often used in nature conservation planning, could assist in the complex planning challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of spatial prioritization to identify green areas with highest recreational potential based on their type and their accessibility for the residents of the Helsinki Metropolitan area, the capital district of Finland. We calculated travel times from each city district to each green area. Travel times were calculated separately to local green areas using active travel modes (walking and biking), and to large forests (attracting people from near and far) using public transport. We prioritized the green areas using these multimodal travel times from each district and weighting the prioritization with population data with Zonation, conservation prioritization software. Compared to a typical buffer analysis (population within a 500 m buffer from green areas), our approach identified areas of high recreational potential in different parts of the study area. This approach allows systematic integration of travel-time-based accessibility measures into equitable spatial prioritization of recreational green areas. It can help urban planners to identify sets of green areas that best support the recreational needs of the residents across the city.

AB  - 'Stakeholder' has become the primary category of political actor in decision-making, not least within nature conservation. Drawing from Habermas' theory on communicative action, this article argues that there are democratic deficits to the stakeholder model that promote citizens to remain locked in predetermined, polarized positions. It contends that the stakeholder model must, hence, be scrutinized with respect to its potential role in perpetuating conservation conflicts in modernity. Using the case study of stakeholder-based game management delegations (GMDs) in Sweden, our research identifies four barriers, which tie to the instrumental basis and liberal democratic legacy of the stakeholder approach: 1) strong sense of accountability; 2) overly purposive atmosphere; 3) overemphasis on decision as final outcome; and 4) perceived inability on the part of the delegates to influence science-led decision-making. The article suggests that these democratic deficits preclude the deliberation and contestation necessary to legitimate conservation policy. Indeed, stakeholder rationality causes citizens to become inert, instrumental agents who approach discussion with strategic rather than communicative rationality. We conclude that the deficits of the stakeholder model currently: 1) restrict democratic freedom for citizens; 2) engender a crisis of legitimacy of management; and 3) reproduce the conflict, which in Sweden relates to the conservation of wolves.

AB  - Aim We propose a novel approach that considers taxonomic uniqueness, functional uniqueness and environmental uniqueness and show how it can be used in guiding conservation planning. We illustrate the approach using data for lake biota and environment. Location Lake Puruvesi, Finland. Methods We sampled macrophytes and macroinvertebrates from the same 18 littoral sites. By adapting the original "ecological uniqueness" approach, we used distance-based methods to calculate measures of taxonomic (LCBD-t), functional (LCBD-f) and environmental (LCEH) uniqueness for each site. We also considered the numbers and locations of the sites needed to protect up to 70% of total variation in taxonomic, functional or environmental features in the studied part of the lake. Results Relationships between taxonomic (LCBD-t), functional (LCBD-f) and environmental (LCEH) uniqueness were generally weak, and only the relationship between macrophyte LCBD-t and LCBD-f was statistically significant. Overall, however, if the whole biotic dataset was considered, macroinvertebrate LCBD-f values showed a consistent positive relationship with macrophyte LCBD-f. Depending on the measure of site uniqueness, between one-third to one half of the sites could help protect up to 70% of the ecological uniqueness of the studied part of Lake Puruvesi. Main conclusions Although the dataset examined originated from a large lake system, the approach we proposed here can be applied in different ecosystems and at various spatial scales. An important consideration is that a set of sites has been sampled using the same methods, resulting in species and environmental matrices that can be analysed using the methodological approach proposed here. This framework can be easily applied to grid-based data, sets of islands or sets of forest fragments. We suggest that the approach based on taxonomic, functional and environmental uniqueness will be a useful tool in guiding nature conservation and ecosystem management, especially if associated with meta-system ideas or network thinking.

AB  - The TRANSFOR (Transatlantic Education for Global Sustainable Forest Sector Development) program has promoted international student and staff exchanges among four Canadian (Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Toronto) universities and universities in four European countries (Germany [Freiburg], Finland [Joensuu], Sweden [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea] and the United Kingdom [Bangor University, Wales]). The program incorporated five components: one or two semester study visits for undergraduate forestry students, working internships, summer field courses, study visits for academic staff, and TRANSFOR project meetings. The summer field courses were a highly innovative part of the program and allowed students to spend three to four weeks learning about forestry activities and challenges on a continent different from that of their home institution. The program fostered internationally focused understanding of forest ecology and management, as well as economic and cultural factors, as will be required to develop effective international standards for sustainable forest management. Most student participants reported that it was a very positive experience and a high point of their education.

KW  - ANGUILLA
AB  - In response to the shortcomings of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, the European Commission has suggested regionalising fisheries management. Examples already exist of the more decentralised management of certain fisheries. Since 2007, the Commission has requested national eel management plans (EMPs) from all EU eel-fishing nations, giving national management bodies considerable freedom to develop their own EMPs. To examine the prerequisites for decentralisation, the Swedish EMP was chosen as a case. The European eel is critically endangered due to overfishing and environmental degradation. Analysis of the Swedish EMP reveals serious flaws: the conflict between the objectives of species and fishery preservation has not been clarified nor is the prioritisation clear. The plan has not been critically reviewed and alternative options are not considered. Though the basic data are uncertain, this uncertainty is viewed as support for not adopting any safety margin. Management is therefore directed towards mitigating the negative effects of fishing and other human activities rather than realising the conservation objective. The efficiency of the various protection measures is also disputable; for example, translocation is problematic, as translocated (i.e., stocked) eels display impaired navigational abilities. Another problematic aspect of this conservation strategy is the slow implementation of the EMP. In conclusion, this study emphasises the necessity of legal and social science as well as natural science research to evaluate the efficiency and implementation of fishery management.

AB  - Many studies of land-cover and structural changes in cultural landscapes have used historical maps as a source for information about past land-cover. All transformations of historical maps onto modern coordinate systems are however burdened with difficulties when it comes to accuracy. We show that a detailed land survey of the present landscape may enable transformation of an old cadastral map directly onto the present terrain with very high accuracy. The detailed resulting map enabled us to locate remnants of semi-natural grasslands and man-made structures with continuity from 1865 and to test hypotheses about relationships between landscape changes and landscape characteristics. The main land-cover change 1865-2002 was decrease of arable fields, and addition of three new land-cover classes: horticultural, orchard and abandoned areas. Of the 330 man-made structures present in 1865, only 58 remained in 2002, while 63 new structures had been built after 1865. We found that semi-natural grasslands with continuity since 1865 were situated on ground with significantly lower production capacity than mean 1865 production capacity. The man-made structures with continuity since 1865 were also associated with areas with significantly lower production capacity than the 1865 mean, situated in significantly steeper terrain but not further from the hamlet. Our study illustrates the potential of digitised and accurately transformed historical cadastral maps combined with detailed field surveys for analysis of land-cover and structural changes in the cultural landscape.

Drawing on a history of the Stockholm traffic radio staff the study examines particular conditions for organizing a service that may inform next generations of smart travel planning systems. The author notes how a vision of involving the public together with the use of increasingly mobile and interconnected communication devices provided the service with an opportunity for harnessing collective intelligence. The study highlights critical success factors and barriers for organizing collective intelligence and the importance they may have had for providing a real-time information service to the public.

AB  - The rates of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss are alarming and current conservation efforts are not sufficient to stop them. The need for new tools is urgent. One approach is biodiversity offsetting: a developer causing habitat degradation provides an improvement in biodiversity so that the lost ecological value is compensated for. Accurate and ecologically meaningful measurement of losses and estimation of gains are essential in reaching the no net loss goal or any other desired outcome of biodiversity offsetting. The chosen calculation method strongly influences biodiversity outcomes. We compare a multiplicative method, which is based on a habitat condition index developed for measuring the state of ecosystems in Finland to two alternative approaches for building a calculation method: an additive function and a simpler matrix tool. We examine the different logic of each method by comparing the resulting trade ratios and examine the costs of offsetting for developers, which allows us to compare the cost-effectiveness of different types of offsets. The results show that the outcomes of the calculation methods differ in many aspects. The matrix approach is not able to consider small changes in the ecological state. The additive method gives always higher biodiversity values compared to the multiplicative method. The multiplicative method tends to require larger trade ratios than the additive method when trade ratios are larger than one. Using scoring intervals instead of using continuous components may increase the difference between the methods. In addition, the calculation methods have differences in dealing with the issue of substitutability.

AB  - Persistence in landscapes is determined by land cover types that remain unchanged over a certain period of time. Mapping and analyzing landscape persistence brings a new view to landscape-ecological research. Insights on processes, factors, or driving forces stabilizing landscapes can contribute to protect and manage valuable landscapes in a rapidly changing world. We analyzed and compared landscape persistence in Europe (EU27 plus Switzerland), as well as in six case studies using historical maps which were harmonized regarding their thematic, spatial, and temporal resolution. The spatial resolution was adjusted to the resolution of the least detailed case study map. To get a thematically harmonized map set, the legend classes were assigned to a common map legend. For enabling a thorough comparison, a persistence index has been developed, taking onto account differences in size of the study regions and in timing of the available historical maps. The persistence index is expressed in number of years that would be needed for the complete transformation of the land cover in a considered area if the transformation would occur at the same rate as it occurred in the considered time period. For the whole area of Europe, the persistence index is 198 years. However, change is not happening uniformly across Europe: the persistence hotspots are located in the Alps, north and south Italy, north Ireland, Sweden, south Finland, Romania, and UK where the persistence index is higher than 500 years. There is a variation between the persistence of different land cover types as well. Natural rocks, quarries, and beaches are fully persistent. Settlements and forests are highly persistent. Least persistent are grasslands and croplands, except olive groves.

AB  - To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II. Ignoring time delays in population and metapopulation dynamics will lead to an underestimate of the number of effectively endangered species.

AB  - Agriculture is a contributing force to climate change due to unsustainable changes in land use with the usage of peatlands for food production in Finland. The use of organic soils in food production is a complex and politically driven issue, thus multistakeholder and participatory approaches to policy development, implementation and evaluation are essential. This study is integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in an iterative process to produce actionoriented knowledge for supporting actions to sustainably manage peatlands and reduce the enormous greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peatlands. This study has engaged inter-disciplinary researchers and transdisciplinary actors in the Finnish food system via farmers, regional and ministry officials, food industry representatives along with education and research representatives to produce action-oriented knowledge for sustainability. The results indicate that actions are needed to develop a shared understanding between relevant actors and stakeholders in the food system to create activities and effective policy measures to remove peatlands from active production in Finland. Therefore, there is a necessity to identify and define incentives from both the public and private sectors to remove peatlands from food production, and thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Interventions that account for local, regional, and national perspectives should be co-created among the inter-disciplinary researchers and transdisciplinary actors in the food system to generate transformative and system-wide change in the transition towards a low-carbon society.

AB  - Plantations of short-rotation coppice (SRC) have a potential for being a useful measure to stop the ongoing impoverishment of farmland biodiversity by increasing structural diversity, and decreasing cultivation intensity and use of pesticides in intensively managed farmland landscapes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of the structure of the plantation and composition of adjacent habitats for breeding birds in 41 SRCs (mean size+/-S.E. = 9.4+/-1.6 ha). Mean number of species per ha in the SRCs was 2.8+/-0.3 species and there were more farmland birds (32 species, 808 territories) than forest birds (22 species, 400 territories). A major result of the present study was the strong influence of adjacent habitats on bird community composition (18 of 22 analysed species affected). There were large differences in bird communities between forest-bordered and open-bordered sites, but occurrence of residual habitats (i.e. other habitats than forest, pastures, shrub areas and arable fields) was also associated with occurrence of several species. The second factor of major importance for the bird fauna was the height of the plantations. Most species (14) were associated with tall plantations (>2 m), seven species were associated with plantations of intermediate (1-2m) height, and six species were associated with plantations of low height (<1 m). A comparison of ecological traits between species classified as preferring SRC and species classified as avoiding SRC suggests that nest height was the only ecological character associated with a preference for Salix habitats, i.e. species with nests on the ground or in shrubs were more abundant in Salix habitats than in farmland landscapes in general. However, a broad spectrum of species was found in the SRCs and many of these seemed to be dependent on habitat features outside the plantations. Planting of Salix in intensively managed farmland plains will have positive effects on bird diversity by increasing the structural diversity of the landscape. In contrast, plantations on infields in forest-dominated landscapes will have negative effects, since the mosaic structure (i.e. mixture of open and forested habitats) positive for most farmland birds will disappear, and Salix plantations favour relatively few forest species. Additionally, Salix could be planted along sharp edges between coniferous plantations and open farmland in order to increase the complexity of the ecotone in intensively managed forest-farmland landscapes.

AB  - The Swedish municipalities, which possess great autonomy for land use planning, are required to have Energy Plans (EPs) concerning the distribution and supply of energy. However, most municipalities no longer have operational control over these aspects of the energy system. Instead, many municipalities have initiated proactive, strategic energy and climate planning. Prior to a potential legislative revision, the current energy planning practice is examined with regards to the propagation of these different energy planning approaches and the influence of municipal energy planning on comprehensive planning. This study shows that 61% of Sweden's 290 municipalities adopted an EP during 2004-2015. Most of these EPs had a broad scope, and it is shown that during the studied time frame the focus of the municipal energy planning gradually shifted towards mitigating climate change. The municipalities' population size also has a significant effect on the propagation and currentness of energy planning. Furthermore, municipal energy and climate planning increases the potential for ensuring the consideration of energy and climate targets and strategies in comprehensive planning, which can facilitate a more sustainability-led municipal planning in line with the Swedish energy and climate objectives, and this relation is thus urged to be strengthened.

AB  - As part of the investigation of a new and optimized environmental flow regime in a regulated river (Mandalselva, Norway), a modeling study was conducted on the trade-offs between the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts and the production of hydropower. Impacts of alternative flow regimes on smolt production were examined under different physical mitigation scenarios using the minimum flow regime recently proposed by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) as a baseline. Different combinations of hydropower operational strategies and/or physical mitigation measures were examined together with changes in the minimum discharge using a series of linked simulation models with the objective of finding combinations that both increased smolt production and maintained power production. This methodology provided a toolbox for predicting both the potential tradeoffs between smolt production and power production and therefore the evaluation of the most cost-effective environmental flow regime. The main finding was that it was possible to achieve a similar smolt production with a lower hydropower plant flow release (with consequent lower power loss) than the flow regime proposed by the NVE. Introducing habitat modification measures further reduced the need for release of water in relation to the proposed minimum flow, while increasing the smolt production. In an economic cost-benefit analysis perspective, benefits per smolt from recreational fishing were small compared to hydropower costs per smolt, with hydropower losses determining optimal flow. This study concludes that the use of a modeling-based methodology to define a targeted environmental flow can be used to successfully balance the sometimes conflicting requirements of effective management of salmon populations while maintaining hydropower production.

AB  - Outbreaks of tree-killing insects are intensifying globally, affecting economies, human well-being, and driving ecosystem transitions. The Czech Republic has recently become Europe's epicenter of the outbreak of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus, the most aggressive species in Eurasia. We investigated a countrywide outbreak dynamic during the period 2003-2019, with a special focus on the period 2017-2019 when the outbreak reached an unprecedented intensity. In order to identify main outbreak drivers, we investigated annual time series of the volume of trees killed by bark beetles in the Czech districts (n = 77), and a suite of climatic and forest structure related predictors using Generalized Additive Models. Finally, we reviewed a large body of public materials to understand broader social, ecological, and economic implications of the outbreak.
   We found that bark beetles were damaging 0.2-1.4% of Norway spruce growing stock annually across the Czech Republic in the period 2003-2016. This level increased to 3.1-5.4% in 2017-2019, causing the total depletion of spruce in some regions. The long-term bark beetle dynamics (2003-2019) was driven by the combination of wind disturbance and climatic drivers, represented in our study by annual temperature anomaly and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. However, the effect of wind was diminished during the period 2017-2019, whereas the effect of drought dominated. Our findings thus suggest a transition from wind-to drought-driven bark beetle dynamics.
   The outbreak and subsequent large-scale salvaging and wood transportation affected quality of life of people in a broad vicinity of outbreak areas. Extensive management actions aggravated some of the notorious conflicts between forest management and nature conservation, and highlighted the poor harmonization of respective policies. A decrease in timber price, an excessive workload, and other cascading effects caused severe revenue loss, requiring state interventions amounting to ca 260 million EUR in 2018-2019.
   We suggest that increasing frequency of climate extremes in combination with the unfavorable forest structure pushed Central European spruce forests to the margin of their ecological space and unfolded large-scale forest transformations. Effective responses will require fundamental structural changes in the regional forest-based sector, particularly aiming at increased social and ecological resilience.

AB  - The majority of untouched natural boreal forests have been regenerated through large catastrophes, occurring by intervals between 50 and 100 years. Storm and fire will open the landscape, result in a huge amount of dead or dying trees and let the pioneer tree species germinate. These processes are the guideline for Finnish forest management today.
   The main focus by maintaining the biodiversity in Finnish boreal forest zone is directed to managed forests. Nature-orientated silviculture on stand level is practised. The site type classification, a reflection of the modem concept of biodiversity and developed by Cajander early in 1900s, on the basis of natural vegetation composition of the site, has the central role by choosing tree species, regeneration methods and thinning procedure, and reflects also on the site productivity. The small size of stands, the abundance of natural seedlings in planted stands and the popularity of mixed stands have a positive impact on biodiversity of forests. The protection of small-sized valuable habitats in commercially managed stands, the leaving of retention trees standing and lying in the forest in all phases of the rotation, are activities made for biodiversity. Many insects and fungi are adapted to catastrophes and so they can survive in single stems left on regeneration areas. Maintaining the biodiversity in multifunctional forests is also supported by the new forest legislation and by the criteria of Finnish Forest Certification System. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Under climate change, the importance of biomass resources is likely to increase and new approaches are needed to analyze future material and energy use of biomass globally and locally. Using Sweden as an example, we present an approach that combines global and national land-use and forest models to analyze impacts of climate change mitigation ambitions on forest management and harvesting in a specific country. National forest impact analyses in Sweden have traditionally focused on supply potential with little reference to international market developments. In this study, we use the global greenhouse gas concentration scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change to estimate global biomass demand and assess potential implications on harvesting and biodiversity in Sweden. The results show that the short-term demand for wood is close to the full harvesting potential in Sweden in all scenarios. Under high bioenergy demand, harvest levels are projected to stay high over a longer time and particularly impact the harvest levels of pulpwood. The area of old forest in the managed landscape may decrease. This study highlights the importance of global scenarios when discussing national-level analysis and pinpoints trade-offs that policy making in Sweden may need to tackle in the near future.

AB  - Leaching and runoff losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were measured in Four catchments in Estonia and Latvia during the period 1994-1997. The losses varied considerably depending on land use and farming practices. In two catchments characterised by cereal production and moderate inputs of plant nutrients, the losses were found to be at a low level, compared to measurements in similar catchments in Norway and Sweden. Very large leaching and runoff losses were recorded in two catchments characterised by heavy applications of pig slurry. In one of these catchments, high losses were recorded even though farming activities ceased in 1991-1992. The effects of slurry applications seem more marked for P than for N. The study shows that the former large state and collective farms that specialised in animal production may still be potential risks for the environmental quality of Estonian and Latvian waters.

AB  - Construction of new artificial reproduction habitats is needed to compensate the adverse impacts of hydro power and loss of original sites for spawning and rearing. In Imatra, Finland, a 1 km long reproduction channel was constructed in 2014, to create a habitat mainly for brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). In the planning and construction the gradients and details of the channel were defined, aiming for the maximum habitat area and quality within the site which was available. Also values for landscape and tourism were considered. 2D flow and habitat modeling was used during the planning. After construction, measurements were done to evaluate the hydraulic circumstances of the channel. The results were compared with the plan and the preference conditions for brown trout which were used in the modeling. The measurements showed that even if the plan was not implemented exactly, the overall hydraulic features correspond to the preferences of the target species. The first monitoring showed colonization of fish and invertebrates, but further monitoring is needed about trout reproduction. The channel will serve as an example for similar projects, to revive fish stocks in constructed rivers and increase the knowledge of planning and construction in the area of eco- hydraulics, landscape design and restoration ecology of compensative habitats.

AB  - Long-term experimental forest fragmentation studies remain uncommon, despite their critical role in the advancement of ecological theory and conservation planning. In 1986 five circular forest fragments (1/16-1 ha) were exposed through clearcutting within an old-growth Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in northern Sweden. Initial responses to fragmentation (1986-1991) showed very high tree mortality and structural degradation of the fragments. In the present study we re-inventoried these fragments to evaluate tree mortality patterns and structural changes occurring over a longer time period (1991-2004). The fragments can readily be viewed as harvest retention patches or 'woodland key habitats' (i.e., set-aside patches of high conservation value), allowing us to make inferences about the effectiveness of these novel conservation tools. Tree mortality rates dropped markedly (to 1.2-3.9%/year) compared to the initial. responses, yet remained elevated over those of control plots in the nearby unfragmented forest (0.7%). Mortality increased with tree diameter, resulting in smaller-diameter, more homogenous stands. Mortality also generally increased with decreasing fragment size and was dependent of tree location within fragments. Standing death (45% of dead trees, 19912004) replaced uprootings (71%, 1986-1991) as the dominant mode of mortality. Numbers of dying and standing dead trees increased during the second sampling period, further adding to structural change and reduced stand density. Elevated tree mortality resulted in uncharacteristically high volumes of coarse woody debris. Results clearly show that adverse edge-related changes to forest structure and function persist up to two decades after fragmentation. Fragments of this size largely fail as remnants intended to maintain forest interior conditions and late-successional forest structure. However, when embedded within a harvested landscape, they: (1) provide abundant coarse woody debris and snags for deadwood-dependent species that risk extirpation in the surrounding matrix and (2) retain important structures for the developing stands.

AB  - The negative impacts of power systems on biodiversity have to be mitigated, while simultaneously ensuring affordable and secure electricity supply for the future. This may lead to trade-off situations where ecological, recreational or social needs are weighted against the need for flexible power supply. This paper explores the interaction between the security of electricity supply and environmental constraints on the operation of flexible hydropower plants in the Norwegian renewable-based power system. A long-term, stochastic scheduling model of a wind- and hydropower-dominated power system is used to assess the implications of environmental constraints and reserve capacity requirements in combination. The model is used for a representative case study where three types of environmental constraints are imposed on the operation of the hydropower plants in a region of the congested Norwegian power system. In addition, requirements for spinning and non-spinning reserve capacity have to be met. The case study results demonstrate varying impacts on the operation of the hydropower plants, curtailment of demand and provision of reserve capacity depending on the type of environmental constraint being imposed.

AB  - The forest land available for timber production in Finland covers 20 million hectares. Just over two thirds of these forests are owned by ordinary Finnish families who naturally want to make sure that these forests stay healthy and remain in plentiful supply. Measures such as strict air pollution control, research and multiple-use silviculture and the increase of protected forest areas ensure that the biodiversity of this renewable asset remains intact for future generations.

AB  - To conserve biodiversity of boreal forests, many management and restoration actions have been undertaken during the last decades. However, research based knowledge about the impacts of the currently used practices are yet largely unavailable. Here we introduce two large scale experiments on the impacts of forest management and restoration on biodiversity of boreal forests. In the first experiment we concentrate on the effects of prescribed burning on species richness of two species groups, which are known to be largely dependent on the amount and quality of decaying wood: saproxylic beetles and polypore fungi. In the second experiment, we study the immediate surroundings of small forest brooks, which are defined as valuable habitats in the Finnish Forest Act. Our aim is to determine the effect of silvicultural practices conducted at the valuable habitats or in the vicinity of them on long term persistence of the special characteristics of these habitats. Our preliminary results indicate that preserving the characteristic features of valuable brook habitats will help to preserve the overall species richness of boreal forests.

AB  - Strategic urban planning is promoted to effectively implement sustainability policies. This paper investigates the role of practitioners when conducting strategic urban planning in a Swedish development project: the RiverCity Gothenburg. A case study of the project shows how practitioners serve a crucial role as boundary-spanners when dealing with the organisational challenges arising during the planning process. The paper concludes that the responsibility put on practitioners risks diminishing the political legitimacy of the strategic planning process. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the gap between politicians and practitioners for addressing the political aspects of strategic goals.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union provides a common framework for water policy that focuses on holistic and integrated water management in river basins. In many member states, implementation of the WFD has shifted the main responsibility for local water issues from the municipal level to the regional or supra-regional levels. In this study, we investigated how the implementation of the WFD has influenced local-level water management including the interpretation of the new environmental quality standards. Specifically, we considered Sweden, which has traditionally had relatively strong governance at the municipal level. Because a sufficient amount of time has now passed for evaluation of WFD-related effects on operational water handling, we interviewed individuals directly involved in water planning and land use planning at the municipal level in one sub catchment in the Northern Baltic Sea River Basin District of Sweden, as well as representatives for superior levels and associations. Despite divergent views regarding the priority of water issues in physical planning among the local-level planners interviewed, they had all participated in successful inter-municipal pre-WFD collaboration projects. Although such collaborations could help increase the understanding and acceptance of WFD-related goals and costs, as well as facilitate conflict solving, as shown in the Oxunda Catchment, they have not gained much attention in the WFD implementation process. Additionally, physical planners have generally been reluctant to accept new environmental quality standards resulting from WFD implementation, in part because they lack precise definitions, but also because they could challenge the municipal routine of weighing various objectives against each other. Furthermore, despite WFD-related increases in ambition levels, lack of resource improvements at the municipal level were identified as potential problems by local environmental planners.

AB  - Indigenous peoples have for the past decades increasingly argued that not only is their traditional knowledge to be recognized in the management of their traditional territories, but that Indigenous control and self-governance over territories and natural resources are crucial for long-term sustainability of the land and cultural revitalisation of its people. In recent years, the Saami in Sweden have also presented themselves as pathfinders, offering advice and solutions for a more sustainable future not only for the Saami society, but for all of Sweden. This paper investigates how Saami claims for rights and stewardship in environmental management are related to Saami cultural revitalisation, within a Swedish colonial framework. It is based on an investigation of the Saami policy positions expressed in policy documents and opinion pieces produced by organisations representing the Saami, linking claims for rights and environmental stewardship with cultural revitalisation and a more sustainable development for all.

AB  - The aim of the study was to identify changes in agricultural practices and periods of agricultural expansion and regression during the last 1,300years in the South-Swedish Uplands. Sediments from the small lake of Skarpingsgolen (1.2ha) were used to quantify land-cover at a local scale (c. 1km radius) in 50-year intervals based on pollen analysis and the LOVE model (Local Vegetation Estimates). The results showed a dramatic change in land-cover, starting c. ad 1150, from a grazed, deciduous woodland, dominated by Corylus, Betula and Quercus, to a semi-open landscape dominated by Picea and open agricultural land. A hamlet, situated next to the lake, was probably established during the 12th century, abandoned during the late medieval crisis (late 14th century) and re-colonized during the 16th century. High values of Cannabis-type pollen (up to 10% of the pollen sum) suggest that hemp retting was carried out in the lake from the 13th to the 17th centuries, while elevated levels of microscopic charcoal indicate that slash-and-burn cultivation was practiced during the early 14th and the 16th-18th centuries. The LRA-based estimates of vegetation show that the modern landscape, dominated by managed coniferous woodlands, is very different from the landscape only 50-100years ago. This type of study is useful for comparisons with historical and archaeological records, and provides sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to identify short-lived abandonments and shifts in agricultural practices.

AB  - This paper targets to improve understanding and explain influential factors of different planning and implementing process of two eco-cities, Hammarby Sjostad, Sweden, and Sino-Swedish Low-carbon Eco-city, China. The study is approached by examining and comparing the two eco-cities in perspectives of plans formulation, policy and regulations foundation, planning management and implementing mechanisms. Lessons from Hammarby Sjostad are that integrative planning and management, follow-up and evaluations of implementing results, and lifestyle transitions all need to be concerned, as well as environmental technologies. In Sino-Swedish low-carbon eco-city, lack of local technologies, supporting policies and regulations, inactive cross-sector cooperation and public participation are summarized as main obstacles. To approach these, efforts are made on formulating local regulations, government documents, and coordinating cross-sector cooperation, promoting mutual learning. Finally, concluding that, besides environmental technologies, the foundation of legislations, policies and environmental objectives, integrative approaches, public awareness are key areas need to be promoted for popularizing sustainability in China.

AB  - This study presents a regional model showing the balance of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in the Swedish county Jamtland, applying a Global Warming Potential 20-year time horizon (GWP20) to meet the Paris agreement horizon and regional policy goals. The results clearly show the necessity to take both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions into consideration in analyses to be able to make proper priorities in future action strategies. The total annual impact from Jamtland calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) is an uptake of 2.4 Mton (19 ton per capita). Jamtland shows large annual uptakes in forests (12.7 Mton CO2), but also large emissions of methane (80 kton corresponding to 6.7 Mton CO2eq), mainly from lakes, mires and ruminants. Anthropogenic carbon Greenhous gas emissions are dominated by transportation, working machines and consumption (mainly imported indirect emissions).
   As a complement to GWP also the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential (AGTP) as degree K response, is presented per sector and total for Jamtland County, for yearly emissions (as a pulse) and continuous emissions over 200 years. A yearly pulse from Jamtland gives a temperature response of about 0 K after 10 years and about -4 mu K (cooling effect) after about 50 years). Using both GWP and AGTP as indicators improves the possibilities to find ways how to optimize regional climate policies to reduce global warming until a specific year.
   Strategies and action plans should be developed focusing on the following:
   - Reduced regional transportation and consumption activity.
   - Increased (prioritized) use of renewable fuels for working machines in forestry and agriculture, as well as for heavy trucks.
   - Evaluate the potential to reduce emissions of methane from wetlands and mires.
   - Increase/optimize carbon dioxide assimilation in forests.

AB  - Complementarity-based algorithms, that delimit sets of sites maximizing the representation of biodiversity, may be useful for targeting management resources to a group of prioritised grassland sites. A. heuristic algorithm MSET was applied to select complementarity sets of semi-natural grassland sites in southern Finland. Site selection was carried out for three different data sets (grassland, indicator and rare species) of vascular plant species occurrences, and three target levels of species occurrences (1, 5 or 10 times). The overlap of the derived sets of sites varied between 46% and 88%, suggesting that algorithms can be sensitive to the delimitation of target species set. The results of algorithms based on species-occurrence data only should be critically evaluated with regard to the habitat quality and other species persistence issues. When applied with caution, complementarity-based methods, therefore offer a promising approach in prioritising grasslands. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

AB  - Monthly rainwater samples were collected during the summer of 1994 in eight arctic catchments in northern Europe (four in Russia, three in Finland, one in Norway), at different distances and wind directions from the emissions of the Russian nickel ore mining, roasting and smelting industry on the Kola Peninsula. Three stations consisting of five samplers each were placed in open areas in all the catchments. Results show that close to the smelters in Monchegorsk, rainwater is strongly enriched in Ni (633 x), Co, Cu, As, Mo, Al (36 x), V, Cd, Sb, Pb (11 x), Zn, Fe, Sr, Na, S/SO4 (6 x), Cl, Cr, Se (4 x) and Ag when compared to a Finnish background catchment. Three sources of elements can be differentiated: natural dust, sea spray and anthropogenic (smokestack emissions and dust). Correlation diagrams and element ratios can be used to identify the different industrial processes and even ore feed changes at one smelter. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Evidence for the introduction of agriculture in western Norway is presented, using three categories of data: (1) palaeobotanical data, including pollen diagrams from lakes, bogs and archaeological sites, focusing on the presence of cereals, Plantago lanceolata L. and anthropogenic pollen indicators, and charred macro remains of cereals from archaeological sites; (2) osteological data, focusing on the occurrences of bones of cattle, sheep and goats in three rock-shelters, and the bone material from one open-air Neolithic site; (3) archaeological data, including artefacts indicating agricultural practices, distribution of residential settlement sites, and stray finds. The evidence for agricultural activity at the beginning of the fourth millennium BC (Early Neolithic, EN) is low, whereas the presence of both cereals and animal husbandry is indicated in the palaeobotanical material from the Middle Neolithic A (MNA, 34002600 cal. BC). The earliest record of domesticated animal bones is dated to the Middle Neolithic B (MNB, 2600-2200 cal. BC), while palynological and archaeological data also indicate an expansion in the area cultivated by early farmers. All data confirm the establishment of an agrarian society and animal husbandry in the Late Neolithic (LN, 2200-1700 cal. BC). It is concluded that agriculture was introduced into western Norway by the indigenous hunter-fisher populations. During this process, social and ideological factors played principal roles.

AB  - Fluvial processes such as flooding and sediment deposition play a crucial role in structuring riparian plant communities. In rivers throughout the world, these processes have been altered by channelization and other anthropogenic stresses. Yet despite increasing awareness of the need to restore natural flow regimes for the preservation of riparian biodiversity, few studies have examined the effects of river restoration on riparian ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effects of restoration in the Ume River system, northern Sweden, where tributaries were channelized to facilitate timber floating in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration at these sites involved the use of heavy machinery to replace instream boulders and remove floatway structures that had previously lined stream banks and cut off secondary channels. We compared riparian plant communities along channelized stream reaches with those along reaches that had been restored 3-10 years prior to observation. Species richness and evenness were significantly increased at restored sites, as were floodplain inundation frequencies. These findings demonstrate how river restoration and associated changes in fluvial disturbance regimes can enhance riparian biodiversity. Given that riparian ecosystems tend to support a disproportionate share of regional species pools, these findings have potentially broad implications for biodiversity conservation at regional or landscape scales.

AB  - Since the turn of the millennium, the Orthodox Church of Finland has welcomed up to 1,ooo new members annually, excluding infant baptisms. This is over 1.5 percent of the church's current total membership. In this study, I investigate Finnish cultural workers' transitions to Orthodox Christianity, based on interviews of twenty-nine people. As a theoretical framework, I use Henri Gooren's conversion career approach. My interlocu-tors' narratives demonstrate how the appeal of Orthodoxy is constructed vis-a-vis the Lutheran-dominated religious and cultural landscape. Another key finding is the over-lapping influence of life crises, social networks, and character traits on processes of individual religious change.

AB  - The stated purpose of Norwegian land use planning is to promote sustainable development. Environmental considerations are central in the planning process, but have to compete with many other goals and interests. In recent years, complexity, population density and similar factors have made the society more vulnerable. Several major floods, landslides and other natural incidents have raised public awareness about the safety aspect of planning. At the same time, better knowledge about natural systems, including the effects of climate change, have increased the level of uncertainty. In this article, I consider the relation between environmental and safety considerations in planning from a legal perspective. While the examples and theoretical framework are from the Norwegian legal system, the overall analysis is general and, thus, relevant also outside the national jurisdiction. Rather than being opposite and directly competing goals, I argue that safety and conservation can be promoted by the same measures, often with mutual benefits. Thus, the current focus on societal safety can actually enhance the environmental aspect of sustainable development.

AB  - Biodiversity hypothesis states that contact with natural environments enriches the human microbiome, promotes immune balance and protects from allergy and inflammatory disorders. We are protected by two nested layers of biodiversity, microbiota of the outer layer (soil, natural waters, plants, animals) and inner layer (gut, skin, airways). The latter inhabits our body and is colonized from the outer layer. Explosion of human populations along with cultural evolution is profoundly changing our environment and lifestyle. Adaptive immunoregulatory circuits and dynamic homeostasis are at stake in the newly emerged urban surroundings. In allergy, and chronic inflammatory disorders in general, exploring the determinants of immunotolerance is the key for prevention and more effective treatment. Loss of immunoprotective factors, derived from nature, is a new kind of health risk poorly acknowledged until recently. The paradigm change has been implemented in the Finnish allergy programme (2008-2018), which emphasized tolerance instead of avoidance. The first results are promising, as allergy burden has started to reduce. The rapidly urbanizing world is facing serious biodiversity loss with global warming, which are interconnected. Biodiversity hypothesis of health and disease has societal impact, for example, on city planning, food and energy production and nature conservation. It has also a message for individuals for health and well-being: take nature close, to touch, eat, breathe, experience and enjoy. Biodiverse natural environments are dependent on planetary health, which should be a priority also among health professionals.

AB  - As with many biodiversity laws, the Habitats Directive allows for exemptions. While it can be argued that flexibility is necessary for handling dynamic ecosystems, the associated lack of legal clarity on the room to derogate can risk impairing both the effectiveness and the uniform application of EU-law. This study aims at clarifying the conditions to derogate from the strict protection of species under Article 16(1)(e), a provision which has been interpreted to provide a legal basis for hunting species with a favourable conservation status in several Member States. One such controversial case is the hunting of brown bears in Sweden. The Swedish brown bear management will thus be used as an illustrative example to discuss Member States' discretion to derogate under Article 16(1)(e).

AB  - In both academic literature and flood risk management practices, it is argued that governance initiatives are needed to enhance the flood resilience of urban agglomerations. Multiple levels of governance will be involved in this activity. However, thus far, the literature has hardly addressed what mechanisms are required to coordinate the different levels of managing urban flood resilience, and what factors account for these mechanisms. Our aim is to address this knowledge gap. Here, we examine six in-depth case studies undertaken in urban agglomerations in different European countries: Dordrecht, the Netherlands; Hull, UK; Geraardsbergen, Belgium; Karlstad, Sweden; Wroclaw, Poland; and Nice, France. The case studies reveal the ways in which multiple levels of governance are involved in managing urban flood resilience. Coordination among governance levels is achieved by proactive policy entrepreneurs, the use of bridging concepts, clear rules, and the provision of resources. These mechanisms seem to be universally applicable, but their characteristics appear to be highly dependent on more general institutional, economic, geographical, and cultural contextual factors.

AB  - With climate change already underway, cities are looking for ways to deal with its effects. To balance urban waterfront development and climate adaptation, floating housing is presented as a promising solution-however it has not been studied sufficiently. This paper explores floating housing as urban climate experimentation, targeting vision/motivation, practice and upscaling in a national context where support mechanisms and traditions are absent. Interviews with innovation entrepreneurs and municipal planners involved with planning and building floating districts show that, with one exception, the Swedish initiatives are at odds with the theoretical assumptions behind urban climate experimentation. Initiatives are neither challenge-led in terms of climate risk nor inclusive and community-based. Rather, the small-scale private entrepreneurs are pioneers in offering unique living on water as one-off innovations. While allowing experimentation, municipal planners are less convinced by the effectiveness and appropriateness of upscaling. Floating housing may contribute to local identity building and place marketing, but are riddled with implementation challenges regarding shoreline protection, privatization/accessibility, limited market interest and urban development fit. While the floating houses themselves withstand flooding, thus safeguarding individual house owners, they do not protect the land-based city with its vulnerable waterfront development patterns. Results thus suggest the limitation of floating houses in shifting development pathways and strengthening urban climate proofing.

AB  - This paper evaluates the changes to the green infrastructure of the megacity of Karachi, Pakistan, occurring during a period of rapid development, involving extensive loss of trees and green spaces since 2000, occurring as a consequence of road widening and improvements to the city's transport infrastructure, aggravated by a series of cyclones, involving further tree loss and which has led to numerous ecological problems in the city, assessing how the effect of the reduction of Karachi's green infrastructure has impacted both the reality and the perception of human health conditions. It uses medium-resolution satellite images classified for land use and land cover (LULC) data extraction and detailed field surveys to map the extent of change; structured questionnaires are used to identify the perception of selected, targeted groups regarding the state of Karachi's urban green infrastructure and perceived human health conditions. Findings indicate that the public perception of green space functionality or presence does not equate with the remote sensing and field mapping results, which show a dramatic loss. The need to develop a comprehensive urban greening strategy, which considers the needs and priorities of the population, is identified. The impact of such a strategy in terms of increased frequency of visits to green sites and associated increase in the physical activity of the people to improve overall physical health is discussed in relation to the general development of Karachi.

AB  - Today's society stresses the importance of public participation and the management of large stakeholder groups. To confront this challenge, community operational research (community OR), as a structured approach, could help. In this paper, we propose a process model for managing community engagement in urban planning. The model builds on ideas of facilitative modeling, problem-structuring methods and innovation management. The model is empirically validated through a case study setting, where a local entrepreneurial community was engaged in an urban regeneration plan for a city centre area in Finland. One reason for utilizing community engagement in the urban planning process is related to decreasing boundary critique, and especially preventing later conflicts. The results of the study indicate that the constructed and utilized process model was useful. The current literature on community OR recognizes that the use of transparent processes enabling dialogue between participants, accepted as fair by the stakeholder groups, has been shown to make a significant difference in people's acceptance, even when they might disagree with the outcome of the decision. Based on the results of this study, this seemed to also be the case in the urban planning context. The findings of the study also reveal that an open innovation-based strategy and methods can bring new insights into collaboration practices in the context of community engagement and urban planning.

AB  - This study compares the noise levels at the cold-water coral Tisler reef, before and after the closure of the border between Norway and Sweden, which occurred as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tisler reef is a marine protected area located under a ferry "highway" that connects Norway and Sweden. Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as being important hotspots of both biodiversity and biomass, they function as breeding and nursing grounds for commercially important fish and are essential in providing ecosystem functions. Whilst studies have shown that fishery, ocean warming, and acidification threaten them, the effects of noise pollution on cold-water coral reefs remains unstudied. To study the severity of noise pollution at the Tisler reef, a longterm acoustic recorder was deployed from 29 January 2020 until 26 May 2020. From 15 March COVID-19 lockdown measures stopped passenger vessel traffic between Norway and Sweden. This study found that the overall noise levels were significantly lower after border closure, due to reduced ferry traffic, wind speeds, and sea level height. When comparing the median hourly noise levels of before vs. after border closure, this study measured a significant reduction in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave band noise levels of 8.94 +/- 0.88 (MAD) dB during the day (07:00:00-19:59:59) and 1.94 +/- 0.11 (MAD) dB during the night (20:00:00-06:59:59). Since there was no ferry traffic during the night, the drop in noise levels at night was likely driven by seasonal changes, i.e., the reduction in wind speed and sea level height when transitioning from winter to spring. Taking into account this seasonal effect, it can be deduced that the COVID-19 border closure reduced the noise levels in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave bands at the Tisler reef by 7.0 +/- 0.99 (MAD) dB during the day. While the contribution of, and changes in biological, weather-related and geophysical sound sources remain to be assessed in more detail, understanding the extent of anthropogenic noise pollution at the Tisler cold water coral reef is critical to guide effective management to ensure the long-term health and conservation of its ecosystem functions.

AB  - Naturally dynamic forests have a high proportion of biotopes with old large trees, diverse vertical and horizontal structure at multiple scales, and much dead wood. As such, they provide habitat to species and ecosystem processes that forests managed for wood production cannot provide to the same degree. Whether termed old-growth, ancient, virgin, intact, primeval or continuity forests, a major challenge and need is to map such potential high conservation value forest for subsequent inclusion in functional habitat networks for biodiversity conservation in forest landscapes. Given that the delivery time of natural forest properties is much longer than of industry wood, we explore the usefulness of using historical maps to identify forests that have been continuously present for 220 years (potential old-growth) versus 140 years (potential aging forest) in a case study in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains (see Online Resource 1). While the total forest cover increased by 35 % over the past two centuries, the area of potential aging and potential old-growth forest declined by 56 and 34 %, respectively. Spatial modelling of edge effects and patch size for virtual species with different requirements indicated an even greater decrease in the area of functional habitat networks of old-growth and ageing forest. Our analyses show that compared to simple mapping of potential high conservation forests, the area of functional habitat patches is severely overestimated, and caution is needed when estimating the area of potential high conservation value forests that form functional habitat networks, i.e. a green infrastructure. In addition, the landscape and regional scale connectivity of patches needs to be considered. We argue that the use of historical maps combined with assessment of spatial patterns is an effective tool for identifying and analyzing potential high conservation value forests in a landscape context.

AB  - If it's true that technological development is certainly an important pillar of sustainable design, however the same is insufficient, if not preceded and supported by a proper urban and architectural planning.
   The cities we live in are sources of environmental degradation, consume resources and produce waste. Now it is necessary to re-establish a proper balance between the built and natural environment.
   Sustainable cities do not consist only of buildings with energy-efficient but also of planning of the urban areas to ensure ecology, economy, social relations and psychologically sustainable environments.
   Analyzing the current state of urban areas it is clear that the critical issues are due to poor planning and management of urban transport and to lack of policy integration of parking and mobility policies.
   Cities are organized to enable and support the use of private transport, the city is developed to support mobility flows arising from the activities in it localized. The research work done so far has enabled us to provide a complete picture of the delicate but complex issue of urban sustainability.
   To identify the main problems, the research started from the analysis of the current state of our cities; once identified the problems, it was analyzed the causes; the research has focused on the theme of sustainable mobility.
   Given the relevance of the theme and the interest forwarded to it by designers and planners, it was possible to identify a number of projects developed following the principles of environmental sustainability and, although each urban intervention appears governed by different planning options, in all cases there is a particular attention paid to the issue of mobility.
   Among the major urban models analyzed: the district Solar City in Linz, Austria, the Vauban district in Freiburg, Germany, the seven projects Ecocity, Bad Ischl (Austria), Barcelona - Trinitat Nova (Spain), Gyor (Hungary), Tampere - Vuores (Finland), Trnava (Slovakia), Tubingen - Derendingen (Germany) and Umbertide (Italy), the Greenwich Millennium Village, London, the Masdar City, Abu Dhabi.
   For urban sustainability it is essential a drastic reduction in the number of private cars, an increase of public transport, and the provision of pedestrian and cycle paths.
   Today there are already several design choices that, from the stage of planning, were aimed at the realization of sustainable urban areas. It has also emerged that sustainable choices do not apply only to projects ex novo but, with right design choices and government of the territory, it is possible to intervene on existing sites (historic center, area, industrial area, virgin area, etc.).. The study of these cases is therefore possible to identify some guidelines to follow for sustainable urban planning and design.

AB  - In Finland, community water supply has increasingly relied on natural groundwater and artificially recharged groundwater as the raw water source. Several managed aquifer recharge (MAR) projects have been co-created with involved parties and have proceeded well, while some cases have raised considerable resistance among the stakeholders. It seems that success or failure in MAR cooperation is related to management cultures and the ways in which various interests are taken into account, from the very beginning and throughout the process. Empirically, this paper builds on comparison between two conflictual case studies in Finland: one in the Tampere region and the other in the Turku region. The study analyses the major constraints of these projects through the lens of collaborative rationality, also drawing upon discourse analysis and negotiation theory. The material is gathered through thematic interviews of stakeholders, newspaper articles and a stakeholder workshop. The results indicate that conventional management approaches, drawing from expert-based instrumental rationality, were insufficient in both cases. The collaborative rationality framework suggests that legitimacy for the groundwater projects should be gained through joint knowledge production and inclusive multiparty interaction for creating options for collaboration. Both cases lacked the tools and know-how for authentic dialogue and collaboration. The emerging paradigm emphasizes more collaborative approaches for natural resources management and urban planning. While MAR projects operate inside these areas and are highly complex in nature, it is essential to embrace the emerging paradigm in order to promote MAR systems along with their huge potential.

AB  - The quest for cogent responses to sustainability goals challenges local spatial planning practices across growing metropolitan regions to develop planning approaches that enable transformative capacity in increasingly complex settings. Based on a case study conducted in the Stockholm region, this paper explores the design and organization of local planning processes to provide a basis for a discussion of alternative approaches that may enhance sustainability in plan and project development. More specifically, it aims to analyze the conditions for embedding and consolidating sustainability issues in local planning processes. The results show that the municipalities need to create conditions for an effective interplay between the planning work carried out in individual projects and the organization of resources, knowledge, and skills on which the projects depend to handle sustainability issues. This study contributes to the understanding of the challenges associated with putting sustainability into practice at the local level by identifying and conceptualizing three important barriers. By acknowledging the temporal, locational, and procedural dimensions of knowledge in local planning processes, planning practices may become better at knowing when, and in what ways, different forms of knowledge can become created, introduced, and used in a synergistic manner to aid the realization of sustainability goals.

AB  - In addressing long-term climate and energy challenges with wind energy, the acceptance of wind power is in a key role. Here, we systematically emphasize the several dimensions of distance, namely spatial, temporal, social, and experiential, and test the difference in attitudes toward near and distant wind turbines in these dimensions. We focus on both attitudes toward wind power and perceptions of its impacts using survey data with spatial information from southwestern Finland. Spatial distance associated significantly and positively with attitudes toward wind power. Regarding the social and temporal dimensions of distance, the direction of the association was against our hypothesis, meaning that the lower the distance was, the more positive were the attitudes. For experiential distance, no association was observed. The results recommend siting wind farms at a distance of over 10 km from population centers. Avoiding conflicts with vacation homes creates a new social challenge for wind power development.

TI  - Increased sustainability with integrated town and traffic planning - A tramway line extension in Sweden
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Planning and Development
AB  - Changing the modal split in urban transport systems towards an increasing share for public transport is generally seen as a necessary prerequisite for sustainability. However, it is not an easy task to improve the competitiveness of public transport with only traditional system internal measures, e.g. fares, vehicle design, comfort, safety. There is a strong assumption that efficient public transport systems demand a supportive and integrated urban planning. Measures such as car restrictions, traffic priorities, high densities in residential areas, "anti-sprawl" policies etc, are important if the target is to create a more competitive alternative to the private car in urban settings.
   In Sweden there is a growing awareness at the national political level that integrated planning is a measure that must be used to reach the targets associated with the very ambitious environmental policy. But there is a lack of ideas and knowledge about the existing obstacles to integrated planning at the local level in the present system.
   This paper will discuss the results from a research and development project with the focus on integrated planning. In the Swedish middle-sized city of Norrkoping, an extension of the already existing tramway network was explored in the project. The extension was conceptualised as a transport solution and a city renewal project, bringing new life and economic vitality to older city districts. The research was conducted in two steps. First, an unrestricted design proposal was developed with the aim to discuss the general potential of the tramway extension in different areas. Secondly, the realisation of the proposal was contrasted with the functioning of the present local political and planning procedures, including financial aspects.
   The results clearly indicate that integrated planning, i.e. combining traffic and town planning, is a tool with a very strong capability to change the present situation in cities into something substantially different. But this can not be done, not in Sweden anyway, without a far-reaching reorganisation and an institutional renewal of local planning and policy procedures, which includes the relations between local, regional and national levels in the political and planning system.

AB  - Two high-resolution pollen and charcoal analyses were constructed from sediments obtained from a small bay in eastern Finland in order to gain information on human activity during the Neolithic Stone Age, 5200-1800 BC. We used measurements of loss on ignition (LOI), magnetic susceptibility and geochemical analyses to describe the sedimentological characteristics. Palaeomagnetic dating and measurements of Cs-137-activity were supported by C-14-datings. The analyses revealed human activity between 4400 and 3200 BC, which is synchronous with archaeological cultures defined through different stages of Comb Ware pottery types and Middle Neolithic pottery types with asbestos as a primary temper. Direct evidence of Hordeum cultivation was dated to 4040-3930 cal BC. According to the pollen data, more significant effort was put into the production of fibres from hemp and lime than the actual cultivation of food.

AB  - There is increasing awareness of the need to monitor trends in our constantly changing agricultural landscapes. Monitoring programmes often use remote sensing data and focus on changes in land cover/land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. Although a wide range of indicators is in use, landscape aesthetics is a topic that is frequently neglected. Our aim was to determine whether aspects of landscape content and configuration could be used as surrogate measures for visual landscape quality in monitoring programmes based on remote sensing. In this paper, we test whether map-derived indicators of landscape structure from the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes are correlated with visual landscape preferences. Two groups of people participated: (1) locals and (2) non-local students. Using the total dataset, we found significant positive correlations between preferences and spatial metrics, including number of land types, number of patches and land type diversity. In addition, preference scores were high where water was present within the mapped image area, even if the water itself was not visible in the images. When the dataset was split into two groups, we found no significant correlation between the preference scores of the students and locals. Whilst the student group preferred images portraying diverse and heterogeneous landscapes, neither diversity nor heterogeneity was correlated with the preference scores of the locals. We conclude that certain indicators based on spatial structure also have relevance in relation to landscape preferences in agricultural landscapes. However, the finding that different groups of people prefer different types of landscape underlines the need for care when interpreting indicator values. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a pressing need to understand how changing climate interacts with land-use change to affect predator-prey interactions in fragmented landscapes. This is particularly true in boreal ecosystems facing fast climate change and intensification in forestry practices. Here, we investigated the relative influence of autumn climate and habitat quality on the food-storing behaviour of a generalist predator, the pygmy owl, using a unique data set of 15 850 prey items recorded in western Finland over 12 years. Our results highlighted strong effects of autumn climate (number of days with rainfall and with temperature < 0 degrees C) on food-store composition. Increasing frequency of days with precipitation in autumn triggered a decrease in (i) total prey biomass stored, (ii) the number of bank voles (main prey) stored, and (iii) the scaled mass index of pygmy owls. Increasing proportions of old spruce forests strengthened the functional response of owls to variations in vole abundance and were more prone to switch from main prey to alternative prey (passerine birds) depending on local climate conditions. High-quality habitat may allow pygmy owls to buffer negative effects of inclement weather and cyclic variation in vole abundance. Additionally, our results evidenced sexspecific trends in body condition, as the scaled mass index of smaller males increased while the scaled mass index of larger females decreased over the study period, probably due to sex-specific foraging strategies and energy requirements. Long-term temporal stability in local vole abundance refutes the hypothesis of climate-driven change in vole abundance and suggests that rainier autumns could reduce the vulnerability of small mammals to predation by pygmy owls. As small rodents are key prey species for many predators in northern ecosystems, our findings raise concern about the impact of global change on boreal food webs through changes in main prey vulnerability.

AB  - Balancing the number of gazing animals with the level of plant resources is a core issue in gazing management. Complete, full-coverage vegetation surveys are often used for this purpose, but these are expensive undertakings. We have presented a method to downscale information from regional sampling surveys by poststratification using a land cover map derived from satellite-based measures of reflectance values. This approach opens new prospects for landscape-level evaluation of productivity. We applied this method to eight grazing districts (19-245 km(2)) in Setesdal Vesthei, Norway, in 2006. Sheep densities in three of eight grazing districts of Setesdal Vesthei fluctuated above the estimated grazing capacity. We fitted 43 sheep with Global Positioning System collars in two contrasting grazing districts in 2007-2008 to assess their selection of the land cover productivity classes in the map used for poststratification. In the area with high vegetation coverage, sheep selection increased in areas with an overall higher productivity, supporting the main basis of the approach. However, in the grazing districts with lower vegetation coverage, selection was higher for areas of overall low vegetation productivity. The likely explanation is the presence of small areas of snow bed vegetation with high-quality forage in areas with a generally rocky surface. Our study provides a first step toward a grazing capacity evaluation to achieve a sustainable management of sheep on alpine ranges of Scandinavia, and our approach is likely applicable to other open alpine ranges in the northern hemisphere.

AB  - In wide ranging species, portions of the same population often fall within different administrative jurisdictions; where different regulations apply. The same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border. This can generate a source-sink dynamic from the areas with lower to those with higher mortality, a process known as compensatory immigration. We tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (Gulo o gulo) population of southern Scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: Sweden and Norway. Wolverines are fully protected in Sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in Norway. Using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture-recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. Wolverines in Norway experienced a lower survival than in Sweden. Migration across the national border was directed towards movements from Sweden to Norway. There was a functional relationship between harvest rate in Norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus confirming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. Contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efficiency of management actions. This calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management. Failing to do so can cause a waste of the already limited resources allocated for large carnivore conservation, and it might hinder effective conflict mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Knowledge integration is often highlighted as a necessary precondition for sustainable urban planning. It is also a way to manage conflicts in complex institutional settings and practices. However, analyses of knowledge use practices in empirical planning cases are rare. In this paper, we aim to better understand knowledge-related aspects of conflict development and resolution. We perform a detailed analysis of how different types of knowledge are used by conflicting actors in two urban development projects in Gothenburg, Sweden and reflect on the implications that such practices have for conflict resolution. We show how integration of knowledge can be identified in the context of planning conflicts and how knowledge use related roots of conflicts become more visible. Attention to how knowledge is used and integrated in conflict management can shed more light on shortcomings of resolution processes and serve as a base to improve conflict resolution towards more lasting, long-term oriented, and therefore more sustainable solutions.

AB  - Intensive forest management leads to forest homogeneity and compromises biodiversity conservation for the sake of a single commodity provision: wood biomass. However, forest biodiversity supports multiple ecosystem functions, with the regulation of insect pest populations among the less understood. We studied how parasitoid functional diversity and composition were affected by forest management and the application of harvesting practices directed to the promotion of biodiversity through the emulation of natural disturbances, i.e. prescribed burning and retention forestry. We used a large-scale, replicated ecological experiment initiated in Finland in 2000, where forest structure was manipulated with several harvesting regimes in combination with prescribed fire. We sampled parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) attacking herbivorous insects, and compared their functional diversity and trait composition between distinct habitats shaped by management and in association with plant functional composition. At the local scale, parasitoid taxonomic and functional diversity were positively related to plant functional diversity. Variation in parasitoid functional composition was linked to the different habitats created by forest management and was associated with plant functional composition. Diversity of forest management, involving prescribed fire, variable tree retention and the preservation of old-growth forest, increases habitat diversity in boreal forests. This management leads to higher forest heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, increasing plant structural diversity and cascading up to higher trophic levels, resulting in higher parasitoid functional diversity. This result gives further support for the importance of preserving natural early successional and old-growth boreal forests, with potential benefits of improved natural biological control across the forest landscape.

AB  - The two-step Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm-comprising the models REVEALS and LOVE-translates fossil pollen assemblages into quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation cover. The REVEALS model has been applied to lakes and bogs of varied sizes, but application to records from alluvial sites is currently lacking and could further extend these reconstructions to areas where lakes and bogs are absent. In addition, since alluvial sites are often located in areas that experienced early anthropogenic impact, such data will provide more insight into land cover change in the context of agricultural development. In this paper, we test the performance of the REVEALS model using pollen records from multiple alluvial sites obtained from the floodplains of the Belgian Dijle catchment. The modelled vegetation cover is compared to the observed vegetation cover based on a historical land cover map of ca. AD 1775 (ca. 175 cal BP). The discrepancy between the modelled and the observed regional vegetation cover is relatively small and can largely be explained by local differences in land cover surrounding the sites, based on the results of the LOVE model. This study concludes that the LRA approach accurately reconstructs the regional vegetation cover of the river catchment based on pollen obtained from alluvial floodplains, and shows that it is able to reflect major local differences in land cover as well. Including pollen data obtained from alluvial floodplains could lead to a substantial increase in spatial coverage of future LRA-based land cover reconstructions.

AB  - Aim
   To compare bird abundances in woodlands along gradients from the city centre to the peri-urban area. To evaluate the importance of the proportion of woodland within the city and in the peri-urban landscape to forest bird communities breeding in urban woodlands. To test whether fragmentation effects on birds were linked to the type of peri-urban matrix.
   Location
   A total of 34 Swedish cities with > 10,000 inhabitants in south-central Sweden. The study area covered 105,000 km2, in which 84% of the Swedish population of 9.1 million lives.
   Methods
   Repeated point count surveys were conducted in 2004 in a total of 474 woodlands. General linear models were used to test for possible differences in abundance along urban to peri-urban gradients, and to regress bird abundances in local urban woodlands on: (1) total woodland cover in the city, (2) total woodland cover in the peri-urban landscape, (3) the interaction between woodland cover in the city and in the peri-urban area, (4) region, and (5) human density.
   Results
   More than 12,000 individuals of 100 forest bird species were recorded. Of the 34 most common species detected, 13 bird species had higher abundances in urban than in peri-urban woodlands, and seven species showed the opposite trend. The bird community of urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with deciduous forests and tree nesters, whereas the bird community of peri-urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with coniferous woodland and ground nesters. Twelve species were significantly linearly associated with the proportion of urban woodland and/or the proportion of peri-urban woodland, and a further eight species were associated with the interaction between these two factors. Local breeding bird abundances of four species were significantly positively associated with the proportion of urban woodland only in farmland-dominated landscapes.
   Main conclusions
   Fragmentation effects on some urban birds are linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. In farmland landscapes, peri-urban woodlands may have been too scarce to act as a source of bird immigrants to fragmented urban woodlands. To maintain populations of specialized forest birds within cities in landscapes dominated by agriculture, it is of paramount importance to conserve any remaining urban woodlands.

AB  - This article explores municipal acceptance of wind power in Sweden and draws conclusions on the basis of semistructured interviews with municipal decision-makers, together with analysis of documents and statistical data. In line with previous research, it demonstrates that wind power opposition is more complex than just a NIMBY effect. The attitudes of local residents influence municipal decision-makers, but may also act to augment and mobilize opposition. Perceptions of distributional injustice, generated by the lack of local economic benefits and the geographically uneven deployment of wind and hydropower, are also relevant in explaining community and municipal acceptance. Moreover, municipal acceptance depends on national political discourses, economic aspects, institutional settings, regulations and sociopolitical factors. To overcome acceptance barriers, the article argues for the need of some kind of formal compensation schemes, directed to both local communities and the municipality. The authority of the municipality to levy taxes on wind power could potentially rectify perceptions of energy injustice between different geographic regions, stimulate higher approval rates, and motivate municipalities to assume a role as an intermediary, accommodating different, and sometimes conflicting, local, national, and global interests.

AB  - The expansion of salmonid aquaculture has resulted in environmental challenges, including salmon lice that may infest both farmed and wild fish. For wild Atlantic salmon post-smolts that migrate from their rivers to the ocean, the first phase of their journey in the coastal zone, where aquaculture occurs, is critical when considering lice exposure. To evaluate the lice influence during the post-smot migration we have developed a migration model. An archive with spatiotemporal concentrations of lice larvae in Norwegian coastal waters has been established using a combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and lice biology models. To estimate lice-induced mortality of wild salmon from Norwegian rivers, the infestation level on the virtual post-smolts was calibrated to match that observed on wild post-smolts genetically assigned their rivers of origin. The lice infestation pressure was modelled on post-smolts from 401 rivers covering all of Norway. Based on this, aquaculture-produced salmon lice-induced mortality of wild salmon post-smolts was estimated to be <10% for 179 rivers, 10-30% for 140 rivers, and >30% for 82 rivers in 2019. Estimated mortalities were used together with other data sets to evaluate aquaculture sustainability in Norway. The aquaculture regulatory system represents a globally leading example of science-based management that considers the environmental impact.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess Malta's government capacity to manage the possible environmental and social conflicts arising from the implementation of its renewable energy agenda to comply with EU's 2020 energy package. The country has targeted photovoltaic technologies to achieve a 10% of renewable energy share in the final consumption of energy by 2020. Malta is a popular tourist destination, it hosts three UNESCO world heritage sites, and it is one of the smallest, although densely populated, countries in the European Union. From the encroachment of PV parks with the existing urban/rural landscape, we found a number of issues worth to be investigated such as the location of solar power plants, participatory planning mechanisms, and aesthetic-design considerations for integrating photovoltaic into the existing urban fabric. The study is based on exploratory interviews with institutional stakeholders and document analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze a number of historical explanations behind the slow process of change in stormwater management in Swedish urban planning and practice. We achieve this by studying three different periods of the long-term establishment of the Swedish urban water system over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, developments which were strongly linked to stormwater. The article recognizes the social construction of the system, i.e., how it grew out of human desires and how it grew extensively during the twentieth century due to an expansive growth of system-supporting public initiatives. These included funding opportunities as well as the establishment of different institutions and organizations. The analysis indicates that in their current efforts to transform urban stormwater management in a more sustainable direction, policymakers and implementers ought to be encouraged by an increased awareness of this social construction; what humans by their desires once built up, they should also be able to transform. Still, an important implication is also the need for such transforming efforts to determinately break away, both physically and mentally, from the traditional pipe-bound system and system culture.

AB  - Changing landscape configuration, a component of landscape heterogeneity, due to varying arable field size represents an attribute of farmland intensification with potentially grave consequences for biodiversity. We recorded butterflies in an intensively farmed region along the border of two European countries with contrasting socioeconomic heritage, one with small farms (Poland), the other with huge farmed units (Czech Republic). Although only the most common generalist species occurred in our records, we observed 2.3x more individuals and 1.9x more species in Poland, and the differences withstood robust statistical controls. Different socioeconomic heritage-in this case, different policies of two communist regimes, one tolerating small family farms and the other expropriating them-influence biodiversity long after the policies that shaped the respective landscapes had been abandoned.

AB  - Spatial planning is increasingly expected to address climate change adaptation. In a Swedish context, this has meant a predominant focus on risks of flooding, erosion and sea-level rise. Gradually, regulatory mechanisms and concrete strategies are evolving to support practical mainstreaming. The aim of this paper was to analyze how frontline planners approach climate change adaptation in an urban context, emphasizing the process of settling and enacting strategic guidelines in spatial planning. The study suggests that municipalities are being preactive, i.e., preparing to act by settling guidelines rather than proactively implementing change when planning for new settlements. Further, the process of accommodating climate risks involves problems. Settling strategic guidelines and determining appropriate levels for what to adapt to are but the start of approaching climate change. Guidelines represent more of an endeavor than settling absolute limits and actually applying the guidelines involves challenges of accessibility and esthetics where the new waterfront limits meets older city structures. Further, guidelines are seen as negotiable since an overarching principle is to maintain flexibility in planning to allow for continued waterfront planning. Pursuing this path is motivated by current demand and previous urban settlement patterns. Also, as future protective measures are needed to secure existing urban areas at risk of flooding and erosion, planners see no use in preventing further waterfront development. Although settling guidelines are important in preparing to act, their practical effectiveness all fall back to how they are actually implemented in daily planning. This leads us to problematize the role of strategic guidelines to secure a climate-proof spatial planning.

AB  - We investigated stand edge effects on Diprion pini cocoon condition and distribution after an outbreak of unprecedented magnitude in Finland. We hypothesized that forest fragmentation and the resulting proportional increase in stand edge habitats may have led to the increase in outbreak area: D. pini may profit from edge habitats and so escape its control mechanisms more easily. This hypothesis was based on the observation that no outbreak occurred in neighbouring Russian Karelia, where the proportion of edge habitats between different stand types and/or successional stages is significantly less than in Finland.
   To test the hypothesis, we determined the amount and condition of cocoons in an outbreak area, along transects going from stand centres through edge habitats, towards neighbouring stand centres.
   Both the total number and number of cocoons in different conditions varied significantly between edges and centres. The effects were more pronounced when age difference between neighbouring stands increased.
   Edge habitats did not benefit D. pini. Both the total number and number of hatched cocoons were consistently higher in centre than in edge habitats.
   Defoliation was unrelated to distance from the edge, even on transects where cocoon density and condition was correlated to distance from the edge.
   We conclude that edge habitats have an inhibitive effect on D. pini densities, and therefore our original hypothesis was rejected. The importance of small mammals to D. pini mortality was demonstrated, and we suggest further investigation of this predator-prey relationship because of its potential for limiting outbreak risk and/or damage through silvicultural measures.

AB  - Previous research demonstrated Northern Sweden may have a future competitive climatic advantage over the European Alps for ski tourism, yet knowledge of climate change risk perceptions, adaptation, and mitigation strategies undertaken by the Swedish ski industry remains limited. This study combined top-down ski season modelling and bottom-up semi-structured interviews with Swedish ski industry stakeholders to examine changing market dynamics, climate change risk perceptions, and current and future adaptations under the backdrop of Sweden's potential climatic advantage. Findings indicate that despite a belief of having greater climate change recognition and preparedness than other international ski regions, stakeholders were reticent to link local conditions to anthropogenic climate change. Snowmaking was the most utilised adaptation option, and consistent with other regions was not explicitly seen as a climate change adaptation rather a prudent business decision. A gap between tourists' demand for increased resort sustainability and the actions of resorts was also evident in several locations. Market dynamics are also considered as capitalising on Sweden's potential climatic advantage will likely necessitate increased aviation travel and associated emissions, a potential barrier to the country's ability to become a 'last resort' for European skiing due to Sweden's ambitious, legally binding net-zero policy target of 2045.

AB  - Wood bioenergy may decrease the reliance on fossil carbon and mitigate anticipated increases in temperature. However, increased use of wood bioenergy may have large impacts on forest biodiversity primarily through the loss of dead wood habitats. We evaluated both the large-scale and long-term effects of different bioenergy extraction scenarios on the availability of dead wood and the suitability of the resulting habitat for saproxylic species, using a spatially explicit forest landscape simulation framework applied in the Swedish boreal forest. We demonstrate that bioenergy extraction scenarios, differing in the level of removal of biomass, can have significant effects on dead wood volumes. Although all of the scenarios led to decreasing levels of dead wood, the scenario aimed at species conservation led to highest volumes of dead wood (about 10 m(3) ha(-1)) and highest connectivity of dead wood patches (mean proximity index of 78), whilst the scenario aimed at reaching zero fossil fuel targets led to the lowest levels (about 8 m(3) ha(-1)) and least connectivity (mean proximity index of 7). Our simulations stress that further exploitation of dead wood from sites where volumes are already below suggested habitat thresholds for saproxylic species will very likely have further negative effects on dead wood dependent species.

AB  - Norwegian forest policy has high-level, complex objectives for the products and benefits from the forest, including increased contribution to the climate, preservation of biodiversity, and creation of economic values. In Norway, it is first and foremost small-scale private forest owners who have to deliver on these expanded goals. The article reveals owners' lack of forestry competence, and elaborates on the role of forestry employees (advisers) in owners' decision-making processes, be it forestry-competent owners or not. There is, however, a decreased number of advisers in the private and public forest services, implying that forest owners are atomised in the meaning of being alone. This type of individualization and an increasing lack of forestry competence among forest owners are a contradiction. The mismatch is serious for the government and the forestry business because it probably hampers the fulfilment of the political objectives. The article presents six options for meeting the obstacles to goal fulfilment. The article is based on two research projects from the counties of TrOndelag and Hedmark. Data were collected between 2002 and 2007 and include survey, focus group interviews, in-depth interviews, fieldwork and document analysis.

AB  - This article describes an environmental assessment of Swedish agriculture, including upstream and downstream effects. The analysis is based on environmentally extended input-output analysis, but it is also supplemented with data from other sources. The analysis shows that direct effects by the Swedish agriculture are the most important, while indirect effects from other sources including mobile and impacts abroad are also considerable. The most important impacts from Swedish agriculture according to the analysis are eutrophication, global warming and resource use. The agricultural sector produces a large share of the Swedish emissions causing both global warming and eutrophication. In addition, current agricultural practice causes problems with loss of biodiversity. The most important actors in the sector are agriculture itself, but also all actors using fossil fuels: primarily the transport sector and the energy sector. In addition, consumers are important since they can influence the composition of agricultural production. The analysis shows the importance of including upstream and downstream effects when analysing the environmental impacts from a sector. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Safeguarding the access to mineral resources in land-use planning plays a crucial role in securing their supply to society. Despite the existing literature about minerals and land-use policy integration, a major question remains: to which mineral resources must the access be guaranteed?
   Based on the findings of two recent European-funded projects (Minatura2020 and Minland), this paper compares multi-criteria assessment methodologies that are in use or are intended to be used in Austria, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden for the identification of mineral resources that deserve to be safeguarded in land-use planning.
   Results show that these methodologies are applicable to all types of mineral deposits and make use of an extensive set of parameters for their assessment, which are grouped into the following criteria: geological, economic, environmental, social, and land-use conflict issues. One of the methodologies takes into consideration potential areas with serious promises for the occurrence of valuable minerals, the remaining only dealing with well-documented resources. When applied, the methodologies prove to be effective in safeguarding the access to important mineral deposits, even if not to all of them, or at least to draw attention to their existence.
   Despite the different levels of implementation and effectiveness, a main common achievement was a transition from point-based spatial datasets of mineral resources to polygon-based datasets. This considerably increased the awareness of the land-use planning authorities about the importance of mineral resources and facilitated the integration of mineral data into land-use planning maps.

AB  - Electric vehicles seem to offer a great potential for sustainable transport development. The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. In the first paper of this tandem publication, the authors propose a new generic process model embedding the Framework of Strategic Sustainable Development. The purpose of applying it in an action-research mode as described in this paper was twofold: (i) to develop a vision for sustainable regional transport and a coarse roadmap towards that vision, and, while doing so, (ii) get additional empirical experiences to inform the development of the new generic process model. Experts from many sectors and organizations involved in the GreenCharge project provided vital information and reviewed all planning perspectives presented in Paper 1 in two sequential multi-stakeholder seminars. The results include a sustainable vision for electric vehicle systems in southeast Sweden within a sustainable regional transport system within a sustainable global society, as well as an initial development plan towards such a vision for the transport sector. The vision is framed by the universal sustainability principles, and the development plan is informed by the strategic guidelines, of the above-mentioned framework. Among other things, the vision and plan imply a shift to renewable energy and a more optimized use of areas and thus a new type of spatial planning. For example, the vision and plan implies a lower built-in demand for transport, more integrated traffic modes, and more multi-functional use of areas for energy and transport infrastructures, for example. Some inherent benefits of electric vehicles are highlighted in the vision and plan, including near-zero local emissions and flexibility as regards primary energy sources. The vision and plan also imply improved governance for more effective cross-sector collaboration to ensure coordinated development within the transport sector and between the transportation sector and other relevant sectors. Meanwhile, the new generic process model was refined and is ready to be applied and further tested in the GreenCharge project and in other projects within the transport sector as well as other sectors. The study confirmed that the new generic process model suggested in support of sustainable transport system and community development is helpful for giving diverse stakeholders, with various specialties and perspectives, a way of working that is goal-oriented and builds on effective, iterative learning loops and co-creation.

AB  - The cemetery lay-out is set to meet the need for burying, but Scandinavian cemeteries are often well maintained green spaces that could be potentially attractive areas for recreation. Shortage of urban green space and changing views on death and funerals could also lead to alterations in use of public urban green spaces, such as cemeteries. The objective of this study is to explore and describe everyday use of two urban green cemeteries in Oslo and discuss issues concerning designing for multiple and everyday use of urban cemeteries. Systematic moment observations of users' activities were made in the cemeteries. Eighteen types of activities were registered including visiting graves, crossing, biking, walking the dog, and exploration of cultural heritage. The study showed a varied use of both cemeteries and that everyday activities were common. Still, the cemeteries' main function is to serve the grave-visitors with a place to commemorate. In the planning and management of urban cemeteries one will have to take the needs of all its user-groups into consideration in order to keep and develop the particular quality that the cemetery as an urban public green space offers to its visitors and the local community. This paper discusses different issues related to various design solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - The effect ecological information has on the decision-making process, largely in connection with traffic planning and land use in the City of Helsinki and its metropolitan area, is evaluated on the basis of some examples of projects. In Finland, significant changes in the environmental legislation have had a positive effect on the decision making process from the environmental point of view. Planning of the new housing area in Viikki was a positive example in this respect. Even though real alternative assessments in the spirit of EIA principles were not possible to realise, the planners were able to offer alternatives that were based on ecological and other sectors of environmental research that resulted in partly preserving the most valued parts of the landscape and nature for the future. On the other hand, in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area traffic plan the ecological facts played a minor role in decision-making despite a significant amount of various kinds of research, reports and carefully applied EIA principles in the evaluation process of various alternatives. To control the process of building density and to minimise the loss of diversity of the surrounding nature is, from an ecological viewpoint, the greatest challenge to the city planners. This will demand from the researchers up-to-date and reliable information on the current state of the city's natural areas and an effective system to convey the data to the city planners.

AB  - This paper explores the effects and underlying intentions of Swedish practices of exporting sustainable development models to Chinese ecocities. Under the 'bestpractice' banner, international architectural firms are often invited to masterplan ecocity developments. The 'sustainable city' has thus become an export commodity, supported by the Swedish government and seen as especially suited to the Chinese ecocity market. Two cases are examined, where Swedish architecture firms have been commissioned to masterplan Chinese ecocities: the Caofedian and Wuxi Eco-cities. In particular, I examine three kinds of 'effects': first, the planning discourse manifested in the planning documents; second, how these plans materialize on the ground; and, third, the effects of this exported planning practice on Swedish policy and practice at home. This paper advances our understanding of how transnational urban sustainability practices are constructed and circulated. It further adds to the field of planning mobilities by examining not only the discourse and diffusion of transnational master planning but also how the 'export' circulates and returns. I argue that the two intentional logics of exporting the Swedish 'sustainable city'-to shape a better world and to export clean-tech products-could both be seen as having failed in these two cases. Instead, the naming and branding of the ecocities seem to boost a certain repetitive problematic idea and practice of sustainable urban development. I argue that the Swedish exported practice strengthens and legitimizes a circulating narrative establishing a sustainable urban planning practice fostering a paradoxically generic image of upper-middle-class consumers as ecocity inhabitants in China as well as in Sweden.

AB  - Utilizing survey data collected using a combined travel cost - conditional behavior method, the aim of this study was to analyze the heterogeneity of preferences among the residents of a city in Finland for the services of an urban park and its stream network. More specifically, by analyzing different behavioral responses to potential changes in ecological, cultural, and commercial services, we identified different groups of visitors to the park with a latent class model. A notable result regarding the demand for services in different classes was that low-income people valued the park more than high-income respondents, making improvements in the park's rec-reational potential a successful social project. We found two latent classes, the main distinguishing factor of which was the preferences associated with increasing the number of events in the park. Adding events did not increase the benefits for the first class, but for the second class it did. In relation to class membership, if visitors usually visited the park alone or if they walked or cycled to the park, this increased the likelihood of belonging to a particular visitor group. In addition, we assessed how a possible increase in services affected the recreational value of the urban park for the city's residents. We found that both the total and net value for different urban groups depended on three factors, i.e., the number of visits, the recreational value of a visit, and the proportion of people in each visitor group. We also used the results of the study to assess the profitability of a construction and management project in the park and found that the project was socially very profitable. Although our study examined a specific park in Finland, its results could also potentially be used when planning the management of other urban parks.

AB  - Ground beetle assemblages were studied by pitfall trapping during summer 2006 in the municipality of Leksand (Sweden) along a gradient in traffic intensity (10 replicates in high and low traffic and five in no traffic) and at progressive distances from the roadside (5, 15, 40 and 80 m). The ground beetles' activity density was larger in high- with respect to low-traffic areas. Rarefaction analysis showed that richness did not differ between high and low traffic, whereas it was higher in high and low compared to no-traffic areas. Rarefaction analysis performed in high- and low-traffic areas separately showed that species richness was higher at shorter distance from the road in both treatments. Gradient analysis showed that traffic intensity influenced carabid species composition, although the proportion of explained variation was rather low. Mean body length differed between the three treatments, where ground beetles were larger in no-traffic areas. The proportion of macropterous and diet-generalist beetles did not differ amongst the three treatments. However, there was a difference in the proportion of macropterous beetles in low-traffic areas amongst sampling distances, and in the proportion of diet-generalist beetles amongst sampling distances at both high- and low-traffic areas. The proportion of diet-generalist beetles decreased with increasing distance from the road in both treatments. Our study suggests that major roads have a significant effect on ground beetles assemblages. However, many changes in assemblages and morpho-ecological adaptations followed the gradient in traffic intensity, suggesting that also minor roads affect ground beetle composition. Therefore, efforts to improve habitat connectivity should also consider low-traffic roads.

AB  - Golf is a popular sport, with increasingly large areas of urban and pen-urban land being designated for golf course development. Yet, more than half of the land area of a typical golf course is considered rough and out-of-play areas that can, if managed appropriately, provide habitats for wildlife. Using pitfall traps, 6944 carabid beetles belonging to 72 species were collected from five urban golf courses and three areas designated for golf course development around the city of Helsinki, Finland in 2007. The courses were rich in carabid species and distinct in their species assemblages. Golf courses were dominated by habitat generalists, species capable of flight and medium to large-sized species. The three courses with areas designated for further golf course development showed that the assemblages of beetles associated with these golf courses have retained many elements from the pre-existing habitats. The oldest golf course is characterised by a more evenly distributed and diverse carabid beetle assemblage, probably due to its higher habitat heterogeneity and longer successional development. However, even this golf course is dominated by generalist species, implying that golf courses may not provide suitable habitats for specialists. It is assumed that the high species richness of golf courses is attributed to the high habitat diversity of these environments, ranging from the strongly human-modified to more natural patches, which provide habitats for many generalist and open-habitat species. Golf courses may, however, with the appropriate management of out-of-play areas provide an opportunity for conserving biodiversity.

AB  - Cities have an important role to play in implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to mobilize sustainability at the urban level. Yet, municipalities encounter challenges in localizing the SDGs into their governance structures, and there is a need to advance our understanding of cities strengths and weaknesses in such processes. In this article we provide knowledge and reflections gained in analyzing the process of localizing the SDGs into the spatial planning of Smorkajen, a former industrial harbor site in Malmo, Sweden. By applying the analytical framework of Institutional Capacity Building, the study explores the process of localizing the SDGs in terms of building relational and knowledge capacities and to provide mobilization capacity by the formation of a sustainability strategy. The results illustrate an inclusive approach supporting relational capacity and numerous measures to enhance knowledge capacity, bringing about the formation of a draft sustainability strategy, strongly supported by the municipal participants. But rather than formally adopting the full strategy in the spatial planning of the Smorkajen area, the results of the process were only to be considered to the extent the traditional documents and processes allowed. In all, the results illustrate a strong support for the use of localized SDGs among municipal administrative units to mobilize sustainability, but also the challenges in actually implementing these in the formal planning and development process.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this overview was to investigate the current situation regarding guidelines and praxis for planned homebirths and also to investigate possibilities for comparative studies on planned homebirths in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden).
   Design and setting: National documents on homebirth and midwifery and recommendations regarding management and registration of planned homebirths in the included countries were investigated.
   Findings: Guidelines regarding planned home birth were found in four of the included countries. In Denmark any woman has the right to be attended by a midwife during a homebirth and each county council must present a plan for the organization of birth services, including homebirth services. In Norway and Iceland the service is fully or partly funded by taxes and national guidelines are available but access to a midwife attending the birth varies geographically. In the Stockholm County Council guidelines have been developed for publicly funding of planned home births; for the rest of Sweden no national guidelines have been formulated and the service is privately funded.
   Key conclusion: Inconsistencies in the home birth services of the Nordic countries imply different opportunities for midwifery care to women with regard to their preferred place of birth. Uniform sociodemography, health care systems and cultural context in the Nordic countries are factors in favour of further research to compare and aggregate data on planned home births in this region. Additional data collection is needed since national registers do not sufficiently cover the planned place of birth. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 requires setting aside vast currently managed areas for conservation purposes. Following bureaucratic politics theory, forestry and environmental domestic bureaucracies use these international targets in their struggle for power and territoriality over forested areas. Against this background, this study aims to analyze the resulting politics on setting aside forest areas from active forest management in Germany and Sweden. Employing a qualitative case study design and empirical data from policy documents and key informant interviews, our results indicate that bureaucracies prioritize instruments that are well aligned with their formal objectives, the interests of their informal constituencies, and their territorial interests. Such struggles dominate the development of policy instruments in both countries obstructing political compromise which results in a logjam in the development of substantial forest set-aside policy. We conclude that unless domestic politics and key bureaucracies provide conducive political conditions international commitments will be very difficult to achieve, even if they are formulated into clearly measurable international targets.

AB  - Climate change, urbanisation and ageing infrastructure are major challenges to the water sector, community and environment. The effects of these challenges are increasing surface runoff and insufficient drainage capacities, resulting in flooding, pollution and degradation of ecological and biological systems. Compared with traditional flood defence-oriented approaches, the concept of resilience enhances overall community capacity with regard to risk management through hazard and vulnerability assessment, and implementation of technical and non-technical adaptation measures. Fredrikstad, like many municipalities in Norway, faces significant water-related challenges; however, unlike many other municipalities, Fredrikstad has taken proactive action by introducing stormwater management into urban planning and development, guiding public and private sectors and end users to take integrated stormwater management measures through the implementation of a municipal master plan (2008-2028). This paper presents a multilevel approach to enhance municipal flood resilience from strategies to practices. The Fredrikstad case study could provide examples of political implementation and recommendations for other municipalities in Norway and worldwide for adaptation to climate change and urbanisation.

This is curious, since public relations helps organizations pursue their interests with the help of rhetorical strategies and various other resources. In order to grasp such processes, a comprehensive heuristic analytical device is suggested which draws on rhetorical and sociological theory, and was tested in a qualitative case study, the Norwegian conflict over hydroelectric power.

AB  - The paper tests the hypothesis that cultural and social background is far more influential to form preferences about policy than the level of fact-based knowledge a person possesses. The data for the case study stem from a web-based survey among a representative sample of the adult population in Norway. The degree of knowledge of agriculture in this paper is operationalized through questions on five key characteristics of Norwegian agriculture that frequently arise in the public discussion. The results show that the amount of fact-based knowledge of agriculture to a very little extent explains differences within the sample. The cultural background of respondents is much more suited to explain agricultural policy preferences. Knowledge, however, shifts the attention from food price issues towards the delivery of public goods. The results allow us to hint at hot cognition as a possible explanation for such findings.

AB  - Marine aquaculture holds great promise for meeting increasing demand for healthy protein that is sustainably produced, but reaching necessary production levels will be challenging. The ecosystem approach to aquaculture is a framework for sustainable aquaculture development that prioritizes multiple-stakeholder participation and spatial planning. These types of approaches have been increasingly used to help guide sustainable, persistent, and equitable aquaculture planning, but most countries have difficulties in setting or meeting longer-term development goals. Scenario analysis (SA) for future planning uses similar approaches and can complement holistic methods, such as the ecosystem approach to aquaculture framework, by providing a temporal analogue to the spatially robust design. Here we define the SA approach to planning in aquaculture, outline how SA can benefit aquaculture planning, and review how this tool is already being used. We track the use of planning tools in the 20 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea member nations, with particular attention given to Norway's development goals to 2050. We conclude that employing a combination of an ecosystem framework with scenario analyses may help identify the scale of development aquaculture goals over time, aid in evaluating the feasibility of the desired outcomes, and highlight potential socialecological conflicts and trade-offs that may otherwise be overlooked.

AB  - P>1. Forest reserves are established to preserve biodiversity, and to maintain natural functions and processes. Today there is heightened focus on old-growth stages, with less attention given to early successional stages. The biodiversity potential of younger forests has been overlooked, and the cost-effectiveness of incorporating different age classes in reserve networks has not yet been studied.
   2. We performed a reserve selection analysis in boreal Sweden using the Swedish National Forest Inventory plots. Seventeen structural variables were used as biodiversity indicators, and the cost of protecting each plot as a reserve was assessed using the Heureka system. A goal programming approach was applied, which allowed inclusion of several objectives and avoided a situation in which common indicators affected the result more than rare ones. The model was limited either by budget or area.
   3. All biodiversity indicators were found in all age classes, with more than half having the highest values in ages >= 100 years. Several large-tree indicators and all deadwood indicators had higher values in forests 0-14 years than in forests 15-69 years.
   4. It was most cost-effective to protect a large proportion of young forests since they generally have a lower net present value compared to older forests, but still contain structures of importance for biodiversity. However, it was more area-effective to protect a large proportion of old forests since they have a higher biodiversity potential per area.
   5. The geographical distribution of reserves selected with the budget-constrained model was strongly biassed towards the north-western section of boreal Sweden, with a large proportion of young forest, whereas the area-constrained model focussed on the south-eastern section, with dominance by the oldest age class.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We show that young forests with large amounts of structures important to biodiversity such as dead wood and remnant trees are cheap and cost-efficient to protect. This suggests that reserve networks should incorporate sites with high habitat quality of different forest ages. Since young forests are generally neglected in conservation, our approach is of interest also to other forest biomes where biodiversity is adapted to disturbance regimes resulting in open, early successional stages.

AB  - The effectiveness of different conservation policies is debated, but the policies are rarely evaluated quantitatively. A Voluntary or 'soft' policy based mainly on education provides information about ecosystems and effects of land use, to encourage conservation action. Swedish forestry relies mainly on soft policy, with Substantial resources for education and advice to more than 200,000 forest owners, while legal regulation is weak. Increased retention of broadleaved trees at clear-cutting, with environmental benefits in the conifer-dominated forestry, is important in the policy. We used the Swedish National Forest Inventory to analyse this policy for young forests in southern Sweden. Between 1983-1987 and 1998-2002 the policy had no positive effect on saplings (1.3 m tall to 4.9 cm dbh) of birch, oak, beech and other species that mostly decreased in density, due to planting of conifers and browsing by ungulates. However, broadleaved conservation trees (>= 15 cm dbh) increased in density, e.g. to about one oak and six birches per ha in Young coniferous forest in 1998-2002. The relative increase in density was higher for large ( >= 20 cm dbh) than for small trees (15-20 cm dbh). The density of conservation trees was higher oil forestland of high than of low productivity. Thus, the soft conservation policy did not influence regeneration of saplings in this type of forestry system, but large broadleaved trees were increasingly saved at 'clear-cuttings'. Advice and educational programmes probably contributed to this result. A continued increase in conservation trees at harvest may require economical Support to forest owners. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studying the interactions between humans, land-cover and biodiversity is necessary for the sustainable management of socio-ecosystems and requires long-term reconstructions of past landscapes, improving the integration of slow processes. The main source of information on past vegetation is fossil pollen, but pollen data are biased by inter-taxonomic differential production and dispersal. The landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA) approach is the most widely used to correct for these biases. The LOVE algorithm (LOcal Vegetation estimates), the second step in the LRA approach, also estimates the spatial extent of the local vegetation reconstruction zone (the relevant source area of pollen, RSAP). While LRA estimates have already been integrated into certain past land-cover mapping approaches, none have been designed to allow the diachronic reconstruction of a land-cover mosaic over the long term combining the following points: the direct integration of LOVE estimates as a source of variability in the composition and distribution of pollen taxa, without multiple scenarios, and the integration of spatiotemporal autocorrelation in the taxa distribution between periods. Here, we propose an innovative approach for BACKward LAND-cover reconstruction (BACKLAND), combining these points and estimating the past land-cover mosaic within a set of RSAPs. Based on three stages using parsimonious assumptions and easy-to-implement probabilistic and statistical tools, this approach requires LOVE estimates of sites close enough to each other for their RSAPs to overlap, botanical data, a digital elevation model and two recent land-cover maps. Developed and tested on a small study area within the mountain landscape of the Bassies valley (French Pyrenees), BACKLAND achieved the reconstruction of a past land-cover map representing eight land-cover types at a spatial resolution of 20 m with a good level of accuracy. We show in this study the originality of this approach and discuss its potential for palaeoenvironmental studies, historical ecology and the management of socio-ecosystems.

AB  - Distributions of Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, As, and Cd in Finnish surface waters were studied by comparing two data sets: samples from 154 headwater lakes collected by the Water and Environment Administration in 1992 and samples from 1165 headwater streams collected during the environmental geochemical mapping program of the Geological Survey of Finland in 1990. It was expected that headwater takes with catchments smaller than 1 km(2) and high lake percentage (ratio of lake area to catchment size) would be more influenced by atmospheric trace metal deposition than the streams, with average catchment size of 30 km(2).
   The lakes with highest arsenic concentrations lie in an area with greenstones and arsenic-rich black schists. The same lakes have high copper concentrations, which evidently are derived from the Cu-rich greenstones of the catchment. The high copper concentrations of streams and lakes in the industrialized region of the southwest coast are due to several anthropogenic sources.
   The highest concentrations of chromium occur in brown stream and lake waters rich in humic matter, while manganese and zinc concentrations, which are controlled by acidity, tend to be elevated in low-pH waters. The high nickel concentrations in lakes in southwestern Finland probably are due to anthropogenic input, while Ni anomalies in stream and lake water in eastern Finland are correlated with high Ni contents of glacial till. The lead concentrations in lakes are mainly of airborne anthropogenic origin.
   The pattern of atmospheric deposition is reflected in the concentrations of Cd, As, Cu, Zn, and Ni in headwater lakes, but land-use, the natural distribution of metals in the overburden, water acidity, and the amount of humic substances influence the distribution of trace metals in both lakes and streams. Thus the trace metal distribution in headwater lakes cannot be used alone to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic atmospheric deposition to metal anomalies in Finnish surface waters.

AB  - Uneven-sized forestry is gradually gaining popularity and acceptability also in the Nordic countries. This is because of the willingness of the public and some forest owners to avoid clear-fellings and pursue more near-nature forest structures. It has also been realized that the profitability of uneven-sized forestry may be competitive with even-aged forestry. In Finland, management of uneven-sized stands is hampered by the lack of information about the dynamics of such stands, and about the yield and profitability of uneven-sized forestry. This study developed models which allow managers to simulate the growth and yield of uneven-sized stands in Finland, making it possible to predict the yield and analyze the sustainability of different management options. The model set consists of individual-tree diameter increment, height and survival models, and a model for ingrowth. The modeling data consisted of two long-term field experiments of uneven-sized forest management, a set of temporary sample plots measured earlier for growth modeling purposes, and the sample plots of the third National Forest Inventory of Finland. The application area of the models covers all growing sites, all main tree species, and the whole surface area of Finland. According to the models, the sustainable harvest of a fertile (Oxalis-Myrtillus site) uneven-sized Norway spruce forest varies between 5.5 and 7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) in Central Finland, depending on the length of the cutting cycle, stand density, and shape of the diameter distribution. It is profitable to harvest large diameter classes more heavily than small ones. Due to the large amount of data the models for diameter increment are highly significant and reliably show the growth level of trees in uneven-sized stands. The weakest models are the ingrowth models, which are based on a clearly smaller data set than the other models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The benefits of urban data cannot be realized without a political and strategic view of data use. A core concept within this view is data governance, which aligns strategy in data-relevant structures and entities with data processes, actors, architectures, and overall data management. Data governance is not a new concept and has long been addressed by scientists and practitioners from an enterprise perspective. In the urban context, however, data governance has only recently attracted increased attention, despite the unprecedented relevance of data in the advent of smart cities. Urban data governance can create semantic compatibility between heterogeneous technologies and data silos and connect stakeholders by standardizing data models, processes, and policies. This research provides a foundation for developing a reference model for urban data governance, identifies challenges in dealing with data in cities, and defines factors for the successful implementation of urban data governance. To obtain the best possible insights, the study carries out qualitative research following the design science research paradigm, conducting semi-structured expert interviews with 27 municipalities from Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The subsequent data analysis based on cognitive maps provides valuable insights into urban data governance. The interview transcripts were transferred and synthesized into comprehensive urban data governance maps to analyze entities and complex relationships with respect to the current state, challenges, and success factors of urban data governance. The findings show that each municipal department defines data governance separately, with no uniform approach. Given cultural factors, siloed data architectures have emerged in cities, leading to interoperability and integrability issues. A city-wide data governance entity in a cross-cutting function can be instrumental in breaking down silos in cities and creating a unified view of the city's data landscape. The further identified concepts and their mutual interaction offer a powerful tool for developing a reference model for urban data governance and for the strategic orientation of cities on their way to data-driven organizations.

AB  - The rapid industrialisation of agriculture and forestry during the last century has contributed to a transformation of the forested landscape in southern Sweden. Palaeoecological investigation revealed how the Medieval forest-meadow system was created about 900 years ago from a deciduous forest type that had been rather stable for the previous 3000 years. The study site was a forest hollow close to where Linnaeus was born and brought up. The species-rich forest-meadow system suffered from over-grazing during the human-population peak of the nineteenth century, and was abandoned about one hundred years ago. The recent forest succession in southern Sweden has led to reduced floristic biodiversity and created conservation problems related to disappearance of open landscape, even though the remnant vegetation is moving towards the near-natural forest type. Spatially detailed palaeoecology permits documentation of baseline conditions, and places conservation debates in a valuable temporal perspective.

AB  - The biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems is under threat and there is an urgent need to quantify the various facets of biodiversity to assess the conservation value of freshwater ecosystems. The effects of taxonomic relatedness have so far not been taken into account in biodiversity assessments of lake macrophytes. We therefore tested the response of species richness and average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD) of aquatic macrophytes along environmental gradients using linear regression models and Bayesian Information Criterion variable selection method. We selected data from four regions, each with 50-60 lakes, situated in northern Europe (Finland and Sweden) and northern America (Minnesota and Wisconsin). We separately studied all macrophyte species, hydrophytes and helophytes. Species richness and AvTD of aquatic macrophytes were generally negatively related in all regions, although it was not statistically significant. Both biodiversity measures responded to environmental gradients to various degrees among the studied macrophyte groups and regions. Species richness was best explained by alkalinity and lake area in Finland, by elevation, annual mean temperature and total phosphorus in Minnesota, and by alkalinity in Wisconsin. AvTD was best explained by alkalinity, annual mean temperature and total phosphorus in Finland and by alkalinity in Wisconsin. Very weak relationships were found in Sweden. Our findings strongly suggest that complementary indices are needed to indicate more comprehensively the effects of environmental conditions on freshwater biodiversity. Species richness was found to be a better measure than AvTD to account for conservation value in freshwaters. However, further research is required to evaluate the usefulness of AvTD to indicate conservation value (e.g. randomisation tests), because alternative measures are clearly needed for those freshwater taxa lacking complete information on true phylogenetic diversity.

AB  - A small focused socio-acoustic after-study of annoyance from a windmill park was undertaken after local health officials demanded a health impact study to look into neighborhood complaints. The windmill park consists of 31 turbines and is located in the South of Norway where it affects 179 dwellings. Simple exposure-effect relationships indicate stronger reactions to windmills and wind turbine noise than shown internationally, with the caveat that the sample size is small (n = 90) and responses are colored by the existing local conflict. Pulsating swishing sounds and turbine engine hum are the main causes of noise annoyance. About 60 per cent of those who participated in the survey were of the opinion that windmills degrade the landscape aesthetically, and were far from convinced that land-based windmills are desirable as a renewable energy source (hydropower is an important alternative source of renewables in Norway). Attitudes play an important role in addition to visual aesthetics in determining the acceptance of windmills and the resulting noise annoyance. To compare results from different wind turbine noise studies it seems necessary to assess the impact of important modifying factors.

AB  - Baltic coastal meadows are among the most threatened habitats in Europe, with most residual habitat being in Estonia and Sweden. We quantitatively related the changes in this habitat type in Estonia to the history of a key inhabitant - the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita Laur.). Between the 1930s and 2000s, 67% of 52 local populations of the toad disappeared; in coastal meadows, the decline was 91%. Since the 1980s, coastal grasslands have lost their value as the main habitat for the species, and occupation of secondary habitats has not balanced the disappearance of primary habitat. According to aerial photographs from 1950-51, 1970-71, and 1996-2000, 60%-83% of the coastal meadow habitats in Estonia were lost by 2000, and the toad became extinct in more than 80% of its historical habitat. The survival of local populations was related to the sizes of managed meadows and sandy areas - larger initial areas were related to better survival, probably due to larger population size. Extinction rates exceeded habitat loss rates during advanced stages of habitat loss after 1970, probably due to the additive effects of habitat fragmentation and the disappearance of critical habitat components. Hence, habitat restoration for natterjack toads should focus on large meadow areas, and should be initiated prior to advance habitat loss. Currently, however, meadow populations of the toad in Estonia are unlikely to persist without artificial re-establishment of populations.

AB  - Radiative forcing impacts due to increased harvesting of boreal forests for use as transportation biofuel in Norway are quantified using simple climate models together with life cycle emission data, MODIS surface albedo data, and a dynamic land use model tracking carbon flux and clear-cut area changes within productive forests over a 100-year management period. We approximate the magnitude of radiative forcing due to albedo changes and compare it to the forcing due to changes in the carbon cycle for purposes of attributing the net result, along with changes in fossil fuel emissions, to the combined anthropogenic land use plus transport fuel system. Depending on albedo uncertainty and uncertainty about the geographic distribution of future logging activity, we report a range of results, thus only general conclusions about the magnitude of the carbon offset potential due to changes in surface albedo can be drawn. Nevertheless, our results have important implications for how forests might be managed for mitigating climate change in light of this additional biophysical criterion, and in particular, on future biofuel policies throughout the region. Future research efforts should be directed at understanding the relationships between the physical properties of managed forests and albedo, and how albedo changes in time as a result of specific management interventions.

AB  - The research's main objective is to explore and encourage modes of architectural practice that can foster multispecies co-living to reduce biodiversity loss and increase the quality of life for both human and nonhuman inhabitants of architecture. This is achieved through conceptual discussions, comprehensive architectural case studies and work-based design explorations that support cross-species co-living in the context of Eastern Norway (ostlandet)-a geographical region of south-eastern Norway consisting of the counties Vestfold, Telemark, Viken, Oslo and Innlandet. A pluralistic method builds on analytical, critical and work-based explorative studies consisting of two parts: (a) historical and contemporary case studies in Norway that support modes of cross-species co-living and (b) design explorations by the second author investigating the operational potential of kindness in architecture. The notion of kindness in this research is built upon an understanding of the amalgam of concepts: solidarity, kinship and being kind, explained in the article's introduction. The potential for designing with and for nonhumans to reinvigorate modes of co-living and support existing habitats is investigated, focusing on the ways three bird species relate to a specific building in Eastern Norway due to their habitat needs in the region: Cyanistes caeruleus, Eurasian blue tit (blameis in Norwegian); Passer montanus, Eurasian tree sparrow (pilfink in Norwegian); and Delichon urbicum, northern or common house martin (taksvale in Norwegian). The research contributes to ongoing discussions within architectural discourse regarding multispecies inhabitation and architecture's role in the current biodiversity crisis and provides insight into both historical and contemporary/ongoing design solutions for multispecies co-living.

AB  - To comprehensively understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity, we must understand how biodiversity has changed over time and what are the underlying processes. A growing body of evidence has shown that beta diversity reveals more about temporal changes in biodiversity compared with alpha diversity. Temporal beta diversity indicates, for example, degrees of change in species composition at single locations through time. We examined whether freshwater plant communities showed different patterns in temporal beta diversity in relation to concomitant changes in environmental conditions across decades. To do this, we used presence-absence data of lake plants for five decades (1940s-2010s) from southern Finland and calculated temporal beta diversity indices (TBI) for each lake between pairs of decades to the whole community, hydrophytes and helophytes. To get insights into possible processes behind the observed trends, we decomposed TBIs into beta diversity contributed by either temporal losses or temporal gains of species. We related TBIs and their loss and gain components to lake landscape position and changes in environmental variables. Based on comparisons of TBIs between the survey decade pairs, the temporal change in aquatic plant communities was modest through decades. Hydrophyte assemblages have changed more than helophyte assemblages. The main changes in temporal beta diversity occurred from the 1940s to the 1970s, when the gain of new species was the dominant process in the lakes throughout the landscape. Following that period, there was only modest changes, but from the 2000s to the 2010s, the dominant process was the loss of species. Temporal changes in environmental conditions played a key role in explaining the TBI. Our results showed that relying on only two survey points in time can result in limited knowledge of the ecological phenomenon under study and, for example, an exceptional year in terms of weather conditions can hinder detecting overall long-term trends in compositional changes. Therefore, future studies should try to combine data from several decades to overcome the typical limitations of temporal information.

AB  - Flood risk is a growing global concern that is not only affecting developing countries, but also the sustainable development of the most affluent liberal democracies. This has attracted attention to the systems governing flood risk across administrative levels, which vary between countries, but are relatively similar in the Nordic region, with both responsibilities and resources largely decentralized to the municipal level. However, floods tend not to be bounded by conventional borders but demand attention to the catchment area as a whole. Influential voices have long argued the importance of fit between the biophysical basis of an issue and the institutional arrangements of actors engaging in its governance. The article investigates such institutional fit in flood risk governance, based on a case study of flood risk mitigation in the Hoje A catchment area in Southern Sweden. Analyzing a unique dataset comprising 217 interviews with all individual formal actors actively engaged in flood risk mitigation in the catchment area illuminates a 'problem of fit' between the hydrological system behind flood risk and the institutional arrangements of its governance. This 'problem of fit' is not only visible along the borders of the municipalities composing the catchment area, but also of the spatial planning areas within them. The article deliberates on regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive elements that align to lock flood risk governance into a regime of practices that, if not addressed, continues to undermine society's ability to anticipate and adapt to the expected escalation of flood risk in a changing climate.

AB  - Natural and cultural diversity is gaining wider global recognition as the key to sustainable development. This article looks at the challenges of conserving marine biocultural diversity by investigating the unique heritage of marine salmon fisheries through a case study of a small group of marine fisheries in Norway, still fishing for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. Tight relationships between declining natural resources and daily struggles to keep cultural heritage alive are highlighted through theoretical perspectives of social identity and local ecological knowledge. The theoretical lens of social identity contributes to better understanding tensions between scientific and local knowledge by bringing forward social categorisation, polarisation and power relations as drivers of conflicts. Involvement of local communities and respect for their cultural heritage, knowledge and practices can assist in more effective management and governance of multifunctional biocultural landscapes, and contribute to their resilience and adaptability.

AB  - Land consolidation in rural areas is greatly influenced by a number of social, agricultural, and economic factors. They extend the time and complicate activities related to the implementation of this project. Land consolidation is a huge investment, requiring a good and up-to-date map. Up-to-date data that reflects reality are the basis for good and efficient land consolidation in rural areas. To improve the creation of a land consolidation project, the most appropriate solution would be to place all the necessary data to create a land consolidation project on "geoportals" websites. Providing data on the websites of geoportals in Poland and Finland in the form of a map portal would enable both visual and substantive analysis of spatial changes in rural areas. Therefore, this article pursues two main scientific goals. The first purpose of this article is to analyze the history and scope of land consolidation in Poland and Finland in order to learn the specifics of land consolidation in a given country. Comparisons and analyses were made on the basis of the authors' experience in Poland and Finland with land consolidation in the areas described. The second scientific goal of the article is to compare the availability of geospatial data in the context of the methodology of performing land consolidation in rural areas, which leads to increased energy efficiency in agricultural production by reducing the need for energy, especially fuel for agricultural machinery. The results from the table with a list of geoportals in Poland and Finland are a summary of the data available for free. Thanks to it, land consolidation contractors around the world will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with and perhaps use this data when creating a rural land consolidation project. Good land consolidation planning will lead to effective and economical use of rural space. This is part of the 2030/2050 strategy. Reducing agricultural production costs, lower fuel consumption, and a smaller carbon footprint. This is what Poland and Finland are striving for as countries belonging to the European Union.

AB  - This paper analyses the impacts on timber and forest products markets of increasing forest conservation in Norway. A partial equilibrium forest sector model is applied to analyse effects on roundwood and forest products prices, quantities and trade of four alternative conservation extents. These alternatives are based on a recent biological analysis of the conservation needs in order to protect biodiversity in Norway. Roundwood prices are projected to increase moderately when conservation increases domestically only, since the Norwegian forest industry substitutes imported fibre for domestic. The impacts on roundwood prices are more substantial if also Norway's forest products trading partners increase the forest conservation. If forest owners voluntarily conserve forests subject to an economic compensation ( which currently is the most likely policy in Norway), the model results imply that forest owners on average are better off with increased conservation. Domestic sawnwood production is projected to reduce when assuming increasing forest conservation, while the production level in the pulp and paper industry is almost unaffected in the short-run. Finally, increasing demand for forest products as a result of "environmental good-will'' may increase roundwood prices and harvest levels in unaffected forest areas significantly.

AB  - Global capitalism has changed the Earth system to the extent that the current epoch is called the Anthropocene. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), land use change has played a crucial role in this profound functional shift in the Earth system. The Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) and its follow-up processes have insisted the same regarding the persisting decline in biodiversity. To shed light on the institutional aspects of land use change and the transformation towards the bioeconomy, we focus on three countries - Chile, Finland, and Laos, showing (i) how these historically very different societies have designed their land use institutions in recent decades, and (ii) what kind of bioeconomy and biosociety these institutional changes seem to presuppose. Our study's timespan is about fifty years, and the analysis is based on our ongoing research in the countries and the content analysis of legal and policy documents in them. These countries obviously differ regarding their basic constitutional and institutional structure and purposes in land use policy processes. We illuminate similarities and differences in authoritative and authorised transactions and discuss, from the perspective of classical institutional theory, how the state and property are entangled in power, how nature is not understood as a common good and public property, and how the negative liberty and economic conception of democracy is prevalent.

AB  - Norway is home to the last remaining populations of wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Concerns over anthropogenic and natural drivers have led to change in the management regime from a population-based model to an area-based model. More complex management goals, increasing involvement of stakeholders, and larger management units call for improved knowledge about reindeer-related values. We examined the responses of 1000 respondents to 39 statements of attitudes and values associated with wild reindeer presence and the management situation in two reindeer regions of southern Norway. We used a partial least-squares path modeling approach to examine the nexus between the attraction of wild reindeer, sustainability concerns, utilitarian and non-utilitarian values, conflicts, and attitudes toward hunting. The results show that local concepts of the sustainability of reindeer are based on opinions about the ecological requirements as well as the roles reindeer can play in the social and economic development of the communities. The attraction of reindeer is a function of consumptive as well as non-consumptive objectives. Segments of the community with different consumptive orientations can share ideas about the attraction of reindeer, but diverge in their interpretation of the sustainability of the species. Improved knowledge about the diversity and complexity of value orientations associated with wild reindeer can be a useful tool for developing multi-objective management frameworks with a diversity of stakeholders who may share similar values and interests, although they have different experience and knowledge bases.

AB  - Land-based mitigation measures are needed to achieve climate targets. One option is the mitigation of currently high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of nutrient-rich drained peatland forest soils. Continuous cover forestry (CCF) has been proposed as a measure to manage this GHG emission source; however, its emission reduction potential and impact on timber production at regional and national scales have not been quantified. To quantify the potential emission reduction, we simulated four management scenarios for Finnish forests: (i) The replacement of clear-cutting by selection harvesting on nutrient-rich drained peatlands (CCF) and (ii) the current forest management regime (BAU), and both at two harvest levels, namely (i) the mean annual harvesting (2016-2018) and (ii) the maximum sustainable yield. The simulations were conducted at the stand scale with a forest simulator (MELA) coupled with a hydrological model (SpaFHy), soil C model (Yasso07) and empirical GHG exchange models. Simulations showed that the management scenario that avoided clear-cutting on nutrient-rich drained peatlands (i.e. CCF) produced approximately 1 Tg CO2 eq. higher carbon sinks annually compared with BAU at equal harvest level for Finland. This emission reduction can be attributed to the maintenance of a higher biomass sink and to the mitigation of soil emissions from nutrient-rich drained peatland sites.

AB  - Loss of biodiversity stands out as a serious environmental challenge worldwide. Old mountain farmland is unique in this respect, as animal husbandry with summer grazing has created a rich ecosystem. Mountain farming usually takes place in relatively remote areas with scattered populations and marginal food production in terms of quantity. Outmigration and changes in agriculture result in overgrown pastures and thus a loss of biodiversity. To conserve biodiversity, politicians worldwide have put conservation of the mountain agricultural landscape on the agenda. The conservation policy includes traditional farming because nature in this cultural landscape depends on human activity. This article explores how policies have questionable effects on the landscape and shows how farmers choose various types of farming based on individual perspectives and goals. Several futures are conceivable, but under the circumstances of global environmental challenges, these are all fraught with uncertainty.

AB  - In recent decades more global attention has focused on the Arctic. This can be seen in the both the development of industries as well as the expansion of the Arctic Council's membership. Countries with at least some part located above the Arctic Circle are; Norway, Greenland, Canada, United States, Russia, Finland, and Sweden. The focus on the indigenous people, specifically the Sami of Lapland, presents a good case for assessing impacts of development on northern, Arctic, communities. In Sweden the population density is recorded as 21.4 people per square kilometer, with a higher population density in southern Sweden. The majority of the Sami people live in small to medium-sized communities, in remote regions, often resulting in a disconnect with the modern world. One industry that is already present in the Swedish Arctic is mining, especially for ore and carbon. However, now other industries, including multinational enterprises (MNE's), such as Facebook, which recently built a new five acre data center near the Arctic Circle, are beginning to realize the opportunities the Arctic region and its environment have to offer. Many are asking how sustainable is business development in the Arctic which can be answered by analyzing the impacts on the Sami communities and how people react and should react to these changes within their communities. This study analyzed current events through literature review and interviews of representatives from the impacted Arctic regions. The increased development has resulted in both negative and positive impacts such as reduction of land use, but increased employment opportunities.

AB  - Deciduous forests in much of southern Sweden are often located on former 'in-field' sites close to farms and villages. The more distant 'out-field' sites are almost always dominated by conifers. Using palaeecological methods, we investigate the origin of this forest pattern at a small estate in Smaland, southern Sweden that was the birthplace of Carl Linnaeus.
   Prior to extensive permanent settlement (c. AD 1100) both in-fields and out-fields supported a rich, mixed deciduous forest that was irregularly ravaged by forest fire. After AD 1100 the in-field site was transformed into a species-rich forest-meadow system with tree composition similar to the pre-cultural state with the addition of Fagus sylvatica L. The out-field sites were used for grazing and slash-and-burn agriculture, but nevertheless maintained a high degree of forest continuity. Forest composition however changed from deciduous to coniferous dominance. Floristic diversity is closely linked to human activity. Herbaceous diversity is greatest during the earliest phase of the forest-meadow system. It declines during the late-mediaeval agrarian crisis and again during the over-exploitation of the late nineteenth century. Diversity returns to pre-cultural levels after the abandonment of the forest-meadow system during the present century. Present forest composition and pattern in the study area are closely related to former human activities and are not primarily a function of soil type or present-day management.

AB  - Traditionally, long-term predictions of river discharges and their extremes include constant relationships between landscape properties and model parameters. However, due to the co-evolution of many landscape properties more sophisticated methods are necessary to quantify future landscape-hydrological model relationships. As a first step towards such an approach we use the Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) analysis method to characterize streamflow recession behaviour of approximate to 200 Swedish catchments within the context of global change and landscape co-evolution. Results suggest that the Brutsaert-Nieber parameters are strongly linked to the climate, soil, land use, and their interdependencies. Many catchments show a trend towards more non-linear behaviour, meaning not only faster initial recession but also slower recession towards base flow. This trend has been found to be independent from climate change. Instead, we suggest that land cover change, both natural (restoration of natural soil profiles in forested areas) and anthropogenic (reforestation and optimized water management), is probably responsible. Both change types are characterised by system adaptation and change, towards more optimal ecohydrological conditions, suggesting landscape co-evolution is at play. Given the observed magnitudes of recession changes during the past 50 years, predictions of future river discharge critically need to include the effects of landscape co-evolution. The interconnections between the controls of land cover and climate on river recession behaviour, as we have quantified in this paper, provide first-order handles to do so.

AB  - Four organic (biodynamic) farms coupled with conventional farms from their neighbourhood in The Netherlands, Germany and Sweden, and 3 organic farms and 4 conventional farms from the West Friesean region in The Netherlands were evaluated to compare their impact on landscape diversity. Materials used were soil-, water-, land use- and land-property maps, interviews with the farmers, repeated (several days) visits to the farms, allowing to make temporal transects, photographs and pictures of the farm-couples and their surroundings. Presence of diverse land use types, woody elements (plantings) and visual elements (vertical and horizontal coherence, colours and forms) were analysed. The results show that the diversity of landscapes and farming system was greater in organic farms. It regards to the land-use types, crops, livestock, plantings (hedges, solitary shrubs and trees), flora, sensorial information (more forms, colours, smells, sounds, spatial experiences) and labour (more on-farm processing and more people involved). Also, all forms of coherence were found to be greater in organic farms. In terms of landscape diversity the organic types of agriculture have a good potential for positive contributions to a sustainable agro-landscape management.

AB  - Traditional clear-fell forestry greatly alters community structure and ecosystem function within boreal forests and alternative management practices may reduce these impacts. Continuous-cover forestry can maintain similar invertebrate and plant communities to unmanaged forest, but whether this extends to soil fungal communities remains unclear. Within four sites across the mid-boreal zone of Sweden, we conducted a comprehensive study to assess the impact of continuous-cover and clear-felling on soil fungi and chemical properties within Norway spruce dominated forests, using unmanaged forest as a control. We sampled soils for chemical properties (pH, carbon, nitrogen, C/N and Organic matter) and used both surveys of fungal fruiting bodies and state of the DNA metabarcoding techniques to assess treatment effects on soil fungal communities. We found that forest management practices had significant effects soil pH, C and C/N ratio and that continuous-cover forestry had more similar soil properties to unmanaged forest. Furthermore, the biodiversity of fruiting bodies, as expressed by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, was higher in continuous-cover forestry and unmanaged forest compared to clear-felled areas. However, the opposite was true for the diversity of soil fungal communities, which was probably due to the high level of disturbance in clear-felled areas, and thus, ample habitat for early successional colonisers and some remnants of mature forest communities. However, in agreement with predictions we found that the composition of both fruiting body and soil fungal communities broadly similar in continuous-cover and unmanaged forest, but fundamentally different to clear-felled areas. Consequently, our findings highlight that continuous-cover forestry is an alternative to conventional practise, maintaining communities associated with unmanaged forest and mimicking natural disturbance regimes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION
   The Bo01 high-density mixed-use development in Malmo, Sweden, was based on innovative planning procedures and products. A very broad definition of sustainability required new approaches in collaboration by the city, developers, planners, and designers. The outcomes of the project included outstanding aesthetics in the plan and the individual elements, as well as spaces that foster social interactions at the city, neighborhood, and block scales. A density of 26 residential dwelling units per gross acre balances the 50% open space dedication. Comprehensive planning for energy, water, and waste systems resulted in significant improvements, especially in energy production (100% is from renewable sources) and solid waste management. A wind turbine provides most of the electricity while a district-wide system supplied by a geothermal storage network provides almost all of the heating and cooling resources. Measures taken to replace and sequester toxic soils on the brownfield site were coupled with the concept for the stormwater system. The surface stormwater system provides a model of effective design, due in part to high permeability requirements. While admirable by American standards, the energy efficiency of most of the 70 buildings failed to achieve the project goals. Similarly, on-site biodiversity measures achieved mixed results. The cost of the residential units precluded a mix of residents of various economic levels typical of the city.

AB  - Phosphorus losses from arable land need to be reduced to prevent eutrophication of surrounding waters. Owing to the high spatial variability of P losses, cost-effective countermeasures need to target parts of the catchment that are most susceptible to P losses. Field surveys identified critical source areas for overland flow and erosion amounting to only 0.4-2.6 % of total arable land in four different catchments in southern Sweden. Distributed modelling using high-resolution digital elevation data identified 72-96 % of these observed erosion and overland flow features. The modelling results were also successfully used to predict occurrence of overland flow and rill and gully erosion in a catchment in central Sweden. Such exact high-resolution modelling allows for accurate placement of planned countermeasures. However, current legislative and environmental subsidy programmes need to change their approach from income-loss compensation to rewarding high cost effectiveness of implemented countermeasures.

AB  - This paper examines the entrepreneurial strategies and development aspirations of immigrant tourism entrepreneurs in rural Sweden, and how they support or conflict with local and regional public sector tourism strategies. Our conceptual framework contrasts the immigrant entrepreneurs' business and lifestyle priorities with public sector responsibilities and development interests. Findings from three case studies suggest that immigrants both collaborate and compete with public sector stakeholders in different tourism destination systems. We identify mismatches in terms of economic, lifestyle and public interest goals, as well as institutional and cultural differences between immigrant entrepreneurs and public sector stakeholders that hinder effective public-private collaboration.

AB  - 1. Following a long history of eradication campaigns against predators, wolverine Gulo gulo distribution and numbers became critically low in Norway in the 1960s. Consequently, wolverines were protected by law during the 1970s and 1980s. This led to an increase in wolverine numbers and re-establishment in some formerly occupied habitats, resulting in increased depredation on domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus and sheep Ovis aries. Wolverine control and licensed hunting have been used increasingly as tools to reduce the depredation since protection was introduced. However, the factors influencing the level of this depredation have not been studied. We therefore examined losses of domestic sheep grazing unattended on upland summer ranges in the Snohetta plateau of south central Norway during 1979-94, in relation to wolverine population numbers, reproduction and control measures. This area was recently re-occupied by wolverines and reproduction has been recorded regularly from the beginning of the study period.
   2. The number of ewes and lambs recorded in organized grazing areas increased more than fivefold during the period, and losses increased proportionally with sheep numbers. The differences in losses among municipalities and grazing co-operatives were probably related to sheep breeds and local variation in wolverine density.
   3. The heavy Dala sheep breed was most at risk, whereas losses from the lighter Norwegian short-tailed and Norwegian fur-bearing breeds were lower than expected.
   4. Killing of wolverines led to fewer lambs being lost in the same year that the wolverine killing took place, but the effect quickly declined, implying a rapid re-establishment of wolverines in the local area.
   5. Lambs were more vulnerable to wolverine predation than ewes, and losses were higher in wolverine cub-rearing areas than in the area as a whole.
   6. We conclude that: (i) control programmes for wolverines, as practised today, will have little long-term effect in reducing sheep losses, unless wolverines are eradicated or severely reduced in numbers; (ii) the introduction of more agile sheep breeds will probably reduce losses; (iii) in areas where wolverine control to protect sheep is a threat towards wolverine conservation, the present sheep husbandry system of grazing unguarded sheep in the mountains should be replaced by alternative forms that provide the sheep with more protection. This is particularly important in wolverine denning areas.

AB  - The seabird Common eider (Somateria mollissima L.) is a characteristic and relatively common bird along the Scandinavian coasts. it has had a crucial economic importance for human coastal communities since prehistory as a source of animal protein, egg and down but this utilisation has ceased today. Due to continuous decline in eider populations in the island of Tautra off the Norwegian west coast from the late 1970s and onwards a number of conservation measures were implemented here to halt this development and the results are yet to be seen. This paper presents the conservation of declining eider populations in Tautra as a case study of conservation challenges in agricultural landscapes, and illustrates the complex interconnections of human use of biological resources and habitat shaping within the context of a subsistence agroecosystem. It contributes new data and perspectives on the challenge to conserve dimensions of biological diversity that have been shaped and developed within previous and lost agroecosystems and economic contexts. The current paper shows the hazard of focussing conservation measures on only one dimension of biodiversity without incorporating other dimensions like the human management of other habitats which had important functions for the development of habitats for the target biodiversity component in the pre-industrial agroecosystem. Successful biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes demands involvement of the historical aspect of resource use to understand the ecological dynamics of habitats and populations. Further, since the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of one habitat are interrelated to other habitats, it is necessary to include the landscape mosaic with different habitats in the conservation efforts and programmes.

AB  - Continual environmental degradation and an unfair distribution of environmental burdens and benefits are two great challenges for humanity. Economic growth is often taken for granted when planning for the future. However, it is often argued that maintaining economic growth conflicts with keeping human activities adjusted to ecological boundaries and finite resources, at least for the more-developed countries. With this paper, we present sustainability goals for building and planning in Sweden to be achieved by 2050 in a context of limited or even negative economic growth. These goals should ensure that all groups in society have sufficient resources and a good life within planetary boundaries. We select four goals in a participatory process: two environmental goals related to climate change and land use and two social goals related to welfare and participation. Our results show that achieving the environmental goals will require significant reductions of Sweden's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use compared to today's levels. Regarding the social goals, these are, in many aspects, reasonably well fulfilled in Sweden today, although disparities remain between groups of citizens. The main challenge, however, is to ensure that these goals are fulfilled even within environmental limits and if economic growth should halt.

AB  - This paper presents a historical outline of how Sapmi cultural heritage has been taken into consideration in EIAs within the Swedish Sa mi region. Since the first EIAs were drafted in Sweden in the late 1990s, the assessment of Sami cultural heritage has exclusively been limited to tangible heritage. Components, which the Sami people consider vital elements within their cultural heritage, such as traditional knowledge, biological heritage, and oral history, have not been taken into consideration. Since 1998, the Swedish National Heritage Board has allocated funds for the support of Sami cultural heritage with four support programs between 1998 and 2012. These programs focused exclusively on tangible cultural heritage. In 2010, the Swedish Sami People's National Association published guidelines on how Sami land use should be integrated into the EIA process. The document includes a clear presentation of the Sami people's worldview and clarifies what they consider their cultural heritage. The following year Swedish Sami Ragnhild Svonni, representing the same organization at the Swedish National Heritage Board's annual conference, spoke about the Sami people and their cultural heritage. Nonetheless, EIAs nowadays are still compiled with a rigorously objectified and westernized point-of-view with little consideration to the Sami people's worldview.

AB  - To implement policies about sustainable forest management (SFM), different international and national concepts have appeared. The Polish Promotional Forest Complex (PFC) concept was introduced in the 1990s. We analysed the emergence of this concept, its objectives and establishment, and its perceived outcomes on the ground. We conducted a literature review and sent out a questionnaire to all forest management units involved with the established 19 PFCs in Poland. The results indicate that the management in PFCs largely satisfied its objectives. However, in the context of SFM, this management was unbalanced to the advantage of the ecological dimension while paying little attention to either social or economic sustainability. This finding correlated with the SFM principle not being clearly defined in the policies for the PFC concept. Our results thus indicate that PFCs became neither pioneers in implementing pro-ecological forestry nor exemplary models for other Polish forests. We conclude that sustainable development as a process towards the goal of sustainability in countries in transition requires time and a change in attitudes among stakeholders that reflect both SFM policy and the transition from government to governance.

AB  - Retention forestry is widely used for reducing the negative biodiversity impacts of forest management. Its effectiveness depends, however, on the post-harvest dynamics of the retention trees, which in turn are likely affected by both tree- and stand-level factors. Understanding the effects of these factors on tree dynamics is thus essential for evaluating the biodiversity effects of retention forestry. We studied the impact of tree-level factors on the mortality and falling patterns of retention trees in pine-dominated boreal forests of eastern Finland. In total, 2738 retention trees were followed individually for 10 years after harvest on 12 study sites with an initial retention level of either 10 or 50 m(3) ha(-1). Prescribed burning was applied to half of the sites after harvest. Effects of tree species (pine, spruce or deciduous), diameter and location (grouped or scattered trees) on tree mortality and tree fall after death were assessed using survival analysis. During the 10-year survey period, 55% of the trees died and 81% of the dead trees fell down. The risk of mortality decreased with increasing diameter in all tree species on burned sites. On unburned sites, this applied only to pines and deciduous trees whereas for spruce the largest trees had the highest mortality. On all sites, dispersed trees had higher mortality than grouped trees. Pines had a lower risk to fall down after dying than spruces or deciduous trees. We conclude that tree species, diameter and location can be used to predict the post-harvest mortality and falling of retention trees and to select trees that best meet the aims of retention. However, considering the biodiversity effects, the predicted tree dynamics should not be the only basis for tree selection, but the habitat value of the retained trees must be accounted for as well.

AB  - Water utilities are facing the challenging problem of planning rehabilitation and renewal of their urban water systems for an uncertain future, which will be affected by climate change, demographic changes and extensive changes in the way the public perceives the water services. For the purpose of envisioning the future, the multiple scenario approach is presented, and its benefits and drawbacks are discussed in relation to other futures forecasting methods. The paper guides the reader on how to build scenarios that represent plausible futures for renewal planning of urban water and wastewater networks. For this purpose, a table is produced that gives an overview of relevant scenarios and their potential consequences. In the end, a case study from a Norwegian perspective is presented that gives the reader an overview of the process of building scenarios based on both qualitative and quantitative approaches.

AB  - This paper explores the potential in foreign markets for winter tourism in Norway and discusses the influencing factors explaining why foreign tourists visit and revisit Norway on ski vacations. In a decreasing market, it becomes increasingly important to destination managers and marketers to choose the right marketing strategies and direction. We focus on characteristics that influence and explain why foreign tourists choose to return. More than 3000 respondents from Sweden, Denmark, and Germany were asked for their image of Norwegian ski destinations and criteria for winter vacation selection. We fitted mainly hurdle and quantile regressions to gain consistent and less biased estimates. Stable snow conditions, combining alpine and cross-country skiing, and no fees for the latter are some of Norway's competitive but seldom marketed advantages, and especially towards repeat visitors. Repeaters typically prefer self-catering accommodation and are less price sensitive. Surprisingly, foreign ski tourists are not very interested in other snow-based activities or cultural attractions. Despite repeaters constituting the majority of foreign ski tourists, neither the national development and marketing agency (Innovation Norway) nor local tourist organizations and marketers have a strategy for targeting them. We recommend a shift from profile marketing towards segmented marketing, aimed especially at the repeat-visitor segment.

AB  - Women forest owners represent a large share of non-industrial private forest owners in Western countries. Gender affects many aspects of forest ownership, and women are underrepresented in forestry, forest organisations and forestry practices. The objective of this study is to improve the understanding of women forest owners' objectives and their relationship with socio-demographic attributes. The study reports the results of a subsample of women forest owners (n = 3066) in a survey of Finnish forest owners conducted in 2019 as part of the Finnish Forest Owner 2020 research project. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a new five-dimensional objective structure. In addition to two more traditional economic and income-related dimensions, the analysis also identified the dimensions of recreation and leisure time, heritage, and aesthetics and conservation. This indicates that women forest owners' objectives are more diverse than those of men. Investigation of the impact of socio-economic attributes, education, income, residential area, place of residence and the manner in which the forest was obtained revealed significant differences. The results help us understand women forest owners and their objectives and differences, enabling better designed policies and services that can engage a wider base of forest owners. Engaging all forest owners regardless of gender or the nature of their objectives is important to safeguard the viability and acceptability of the forest sector in Finland and to ensure that Finnish forests are managed in a way that reflects the needs and wishes of society and forest owners.

AB  - Community planners, decision-makers and authorities frequently encounter conflicts revolving around natural resource management as well as around urban planning. Since the 1970s, the dynamics of conflict resolution have evolved from conventional expert-based rational solutions towards collaborative ones. Against this background, our research investigates one contentious groundwater project in the Tampere Region in Finland. Conflict assessment clarified the divergent interests of the multiple parties. Drawing on negotiation theory, this study illustrates how polarised positions and competitive framing, as well as the influence of historical baggage, may form an insurmountable barrier to successful negotiation. While the acknowledgement of various interests should form the heart of the integrative negotiation process, excessive energy is used for argumentation to protect predefined goals with as minor concessions as possible. Addressing the collaborative approach, we suggest multiple ways towards creating mutual gains and cooperation in future water supply projects.

AB  - The temporary use of vacant spaces has become integrated into formal urban development practices. This paper seeks to explore the catalytic power of temporary urbanism for sustainable urban development by focusing on the tension between temporary and permanent and the dynamics through which temporary urbanism becomes catalytic. The case study focuses on a six-year experimental period of the Hiedanranta brownfield until the city started to build the area for a new residential district in Tampere, Finland. Rich details of temporary urbanism were achieved through interviews with 27 city developers and experimental participants. The analysis revealed three tracks of catalytic mechanisms of temporary urbanism emerging from the persistent tension between temporary and permanent. By demonstrating the origins of catalytic power, this research contributes to academic and practical interests to find productive relationships between temporary urbanism, planning and sustainability governance in cities.

KW  - sustainable development
AB  - A modern feature of flood risk management is to integrate ecological, economic and social aspects in risk prevention and mitigation. Risk-reducing measures can be in conflict with ecosystem functions and complicate upstream/downstream relations. Flood risks are also influenced by processes in the catchment, such as changes in climate and land-use, or increases of vulnerable urban areas. Lake Vanern in Sweden has high ecological and social values but is also flood-prone, which in this article has been analyzed from a perspective of sustainable development. Lake Vanern and the Gota alv River are used for drinking water supply, shipping, hydropower production, fishing, tourism, as a recipient for industries and wastewater plants, etc. The flood risks are connected to landslide and industrial risks. One interest at stake is the drinking water supply for 800,000 persons in the Gothenburg region. According to climate scenarios, flood risks will increase in the 21(st) century due to increased precipitation. Recent studies in the region were used to identify relevant interests and values connected to Lake Vanern. The study reveals differing interests in relation to water level regimes. From a flood protection perspective (risks around the lake and downstream to Gothenburg) a low and stable water level is beneficial. For shipping and hydropower, a stable medium-high water level is wanted, whereas from an ecosystem and landscape development perspective larger water level amplitudes are optimal. One out of a few reasons for this is the need to prevent a massive increase in vegetation in coastal areas. There are good reasons to have a broad decision-support, representing different values and interests, when the permanent water regulation scheme will be decided. This study also addresses the potential to reconcile the concept of flood risk management with that of a sustainable development.

AB  - This paper discusses the rapidly emerging fascination with dystopian dark tourism. Using participatory observation, this exploratory study examines and analyzes three specific destinations where tourists engage with both death and dystopia. Through our examination of the Charles Manson 'Helter Skelter Tour' in Los Angeles, the H.R. Giger Museum in Gruyeres, Switzerland and the Inferno Music Festival in both Lausanne, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway, we present a model of dystopian dark tourism that integrates dark aesthetics, simulation, emotional contagion and the current global cultural fascination with both utopia and dystopia. We posit that interest in dystopian dark tourism experiences is reflective of an increased insecurity about death, society and its relationship to violence and cultural production.

AB  - This study aims to assess the degree of regularity in the effect of patch size and patch shape on plant species richness across a macroscale region, and to evaluate the implications for nature conservation.
   Our study area covers south-eastern Norway and contains 16 agricultural landscapes with 2162 patches.
   To analyse regularity a local linear mixed model (LLMM) was applied. This procedure estimates the richness trends due to shared effects of size and shape, and simultaneously provides the landscape-specific random effect. The latter is a direct estimate of the degree of irregularity between the landscapes, conditioned on specific values of size and shape.
   The results show a positive interaction between the shape and size of patches, which is repeated for all landscapes. The shape of the patches produces more regular patterns in species richness than the size of patches. This we attribute to effects of dispersal and distance to neighbouring patches of different environmentally conditioned species pools. Large and complex patches have shorter average distance to neighbouring patches (of different types) than large simple-shaped (circular) patches have. We attribute the higher species richness of the former, given a similar area, to a higher number of species dispersed from the outside into the more complex plot. For small patches, however, the distance to the edge is short relative to normal dispersal distances, for patches of all shapes. This explains why the positive effect of shape complexity on species richness is stronger for large patches. This interpretation is supported by a strong spatial correlation conditioned on the most complex patches.
   Theories of dynamics in biodiversity in patchy landscapes must consider shape as a regulator at the same level as size, and both shape and size of patches should be simultaneously taken into account for management planning.

AB  - Habitat classification schemes provide tools for harmonized mapping, monitoring and assessment of habitats across regions. They also offer ways to simplify large biodiversity datasets to reveal main environmental and biological characteristics of a region, which might be sufficient level of detail for example in regional planning processes. Since 2013, HELCOM underwater biotope and habitat classification system (HELCOM HUB) has provided a framework to classify the marine underwater nature of the Baltic Sea, but so far, its functionality in describing the variation in Baltic Sea biological communities has only rarely been tested. We tested the functionality of HELCOM HUB in describing variation in rocky shore communities on a large scale, across the Finnish marine area. We found the classification tool very useful in simplifying complex biodiversity data and in creating quantitative presentations on community variation. The results show how the proportional occurrences of different rocky shore communities change in relation to each other along the environmental gradients of the northern Baltic Sea: along the coast in different salinity regimes, from sheltered archipelagos to the open sea and when going from shallow sublittoral to deeper waters. Although the importance of regional habitat classification schemes is recognized, we found also some weaknesses in HELCOM HUB. The red algal communities that are generally recognized as key components of northern Baltic Sea rocky shores were clearly "lost in classification", although they were shown to be both common and to occur in relatively high coverages, especially in the southwestern part of the study area. This was mainly due to division of red algae into many "sub-groups" at levels 5 and 6 in the classification (e.g. perennial foliose red algae and perennial non-filamentous corticated red algae) that led to their "fragmentation" within the classification. This further resulted in low coverages of red algae within the sub-groups, and finally, in their classification to other classes such as blue mussels or other algal groups. The result highlights the need to consider the restrictions of any classification system when classified data is used in management contexts. When taxa are "lost in classification", we might not just ignore species or communities, but also key ecosystem functions.

AB  - There is apprehension that the decoupling of EU income support will result in shortages of livestock for preservation of biodiversity in Swedish seminatural pastures. However, in a region studied in British Columbia with natural conditions similar to those in central Sweden but with no income support, one-third of the agricultural land is semi-natural pastures and the number of beef cattle has increased. This can be explained by the availability of cheap outdoor wintering of cattle and low opportunity cost of land. The results suggest that the abolition of income support and the tradition of expensive indoor wintering, but maintained environmental allowance for grazing, would result in land use in large parts of Sweden similar to that in the British Columbia region.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation threaten the long-term viability of innumerable species of plants and animals. At the same time, habitat fragmentation may impose strong natural selection and lead to evolution of life histories with possible consequences for demographic dynamics. The Baltic populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabit regions with highly fragmented habitat (networks of small dry meadows) as well as regions with extensive continuous habitat (calcareous alvar grasslands). Here, we report the results of common garden studies on butterflies originating from two highly fragmented landscapes (FL) in Finland and Sweden and from two continuous landscapes (CL) in Sweden and Estonia, conducted in a large outdoor cage (32 by 26m) and in the laboratory. We investigated a comprehensive set of 51 life-history traits, including measures of larval growth and development, flight performance, and adult reproductive behavior. Seventeen of the 51 traits showed a significant difference between fragmented versus CL. Most notably, the growth rate of postdiapause larvae and several measures of flight capacity, including flight metabolic rate, were higher in butterflies from fragmented than CL. Females from CL had shorter intervals between consecutive egg clutches and somewhat higher life-time egg production, but shorter longevity, than females from FL. These results are likely to reflect the constant opportunities for oviposition in females living in continuous habitats, while the more dispersive females from FL allocate more resources to dispersal capacity at the cost of egg maturation rate. This study supports theoretical predictions about small population sizes and high rate of population turnover in fragmented habitats selecting for increased rate of dispersal, but the results also indicate that many other life-history traits apart from dispersal are affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Circular water management has the potential to close resource and material loops within and across value chains. In the water industry, circular municipal wastewater management through industrial urban symbiosis (IUS) is recognized as a solution to overcome water scarcity in urban environments. IUS involves collaboration between actors with different organizational backgrounds, which can lead to inherent risks of conflicting goals. This study explores how different values drive various organizations to participate in an emerging circular wastewater collaboration. The study comprises a literature review of 34 scientific articles and a case study of a potential circular wastewater system through IUS in Simrishamn, Sweden. It presents an interdisciplinary framework based on the total economic value concept and organizational archetypes for examining actor values in circular wastewater management. This framework provides a novel approach for assessing different values and how they may compete or align. It can also identify the absence of certain values, enabling the achievement of a minimum level of value coherence amongst different actors, and thereby increasing the sustainability and effectiveness of circular wastewater collaborations. Therefore, careful planning and stakeholder interaction, in accordance with economic value perspectives, can enhance the legitimacy and policy development of circular solutions.

AB  - The aim of my contribution is to explore the extent to which the narrative content of several extreme metal bands from Norway valorizes and recycles elements of cultural heritage and memory, embedding them into local discourses with a global appeal. Thematically revolving around a transgressive mixture of Satanism, misanthropy, nihilism, totalitarianism or Neopaganism, the music tried to acquire a cultural capital that would construct an alternative spiritual identity. Notions of a romanticized community and mythologized past produce however an image of Norwegianness. To my mind, music utilizes the mechanisms of inventing tradition and creates the idea of a `nation' by staging conservative worldviews of homogenized heritage, expressed through Norwegian imagery, rural landscapes, mountains, forests in album artwork reminiscent of Norway's romantic painters, the evocation of folklore and historic tales or simply lexical formulae such as "Norwegian Native Art" (Einherjer 2000). I will be briefly exploring this idea using a critical discourse approach and the concept of cultural and national identity and memory.

AB  - We examined the butterfly fauna at 62 sites in southeastern Sweden within a region exhibiting high variation in the landscape surrounding the studied grasslands. The landscape varied from an intensively-managed agricultural landscape with a large amount of open fields to a landscape with a high amount of deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland. We made 12 179 observations of 57 species of butterflies. The amount of neighbouring deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland, with >25% tree and bush cover, was the most important environmental factor explaining the variation in the butterfly assemblages. Landscape analyses at three different spatial scales showed that the variation in butterfly assemblages could be explained only at the largest scale (radius 5000 m) and not at the smaller ones (radii 500 and 2000 m).
   Logistic regressions were used to predict presence/absence of butterfly species. Our study indicated that there may be critical thresholds for the amount of habitat at the landscape scale for several butterfly species as well as for species richness. For Melitaea athalia, there was a sharp increase in occupancy probability between 3 and 10% deciduous forests/semi-natural grasslands at the 5000-m scale. For 12 other species, the value for 50% probability of occurrence varied between 2 and 12% deciduous forest/semi-natural grassland. Species which had high occupancy probabilities in landscapes with a low amount of surrounding deciduous forests/semi-natural grasslands were significantly more mobile than others.
   Our study highlights the importance of applying a landscape perspective in conservation management, and that single-patch management might fail in maintaining a diverse butterfly assemblage.

AB  - Offsetting nation-wide CO2 emissions by carbon sinks from land use change (LUC), e.g. agricultural fields extensification and afforestation, is considered as a major climate change mitigation option. We evaluated the LUC potential for reducing emissions and creating annual soil and ecosystem carbon sinks in Finland. We used agricultural statistics, the forest growth model MOTTI, the soil carbon model Yasso07, and the RCP8.5 climate scenario.
   The soil carbon stock (SOC) of extensified grasslands showed on average less carbon loss than cropland, thus reducing future carbon emissions by LUC between 0.17 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), initially, and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) after 50 years. The annual rate of such carbon gain was in comparison to SOC between 1.4 parts per thousand and 0.7 parts per thousand which is lower than proposed by the Paris 4 parts per thousand initiative for offsetting global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Furthermore, after afforestation, estimated SOC is expected to increase above pre-LUC levels with 30 years lag. Estimated SOC sink from afforestation when compared to continuous cultivation varied depending on dominant tree species and soil fertility from between 0.19 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (1.7 parts per thousand for spruce in medium fertile soil) to 0.46 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (3.7 parts per thousand for silver birch in highly fertile soil). Future total soil and biomass carbon sink attributed to afforestation ranged between 1.65 and 2.44 Mg ha(-1) y(-1).
   Combined carbon sinks created by the present LUC could with 30 years lag offset annually between 0.01 and 4% of the present national net CO2 emissions in Finland. The long delay and a small scale of potential future carbon emission reduction by the LUC highlighted the importance of employing additional tools to reach the national neutrality targets due in next 15 or 30 years.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation, as an unstoppable global phenomenon, has led to decreasing connectivity between habitats, which gives strong pressure on organisms. Current research has barely investigated urban effects on aquatic insect species traits. Here, we investigated how inter- and intraspecific variations of flight-related morphological traits change along an urban gradient in three species of Dytiscidae at different landscape scales.2. We collected specimens in 30 urban wetlands in Helsinki, Finland. We measured flight-related traits, including body length, pronotum length, elytron length, and the hind wing length and area. With linear models, we modelled how flight-related traits of the three species responded to the percentage of impermeable surfaces in buffers with nine different radii: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m. 3. Our results show that (a) Ilybius ater was not affected by urbanisation in traits, indicating that some species are good dispersers and pre-adapted to urbanisation. (b) The other two species, Acilius canaliculatus and Hydaticus seminiger, exhibited different patterns along the urban gradient, suggesting species utilise different strategies to cope with movement barriers in urban landscapes. (c) Species were affected by urbanisation at different scales, suggesting species have different ability to adjust morphological plasticity to endure movement barriers caused by urbanisation.4. This study reveals that urban land-use change can have complex effects on inter- and intraspecific variation of aquatic insects. We highlight that urban planning should consider at which scale target species can endure urbanisation, to create an effective network of urban ponds for aquatic biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends on regional and local authorities' ability to implement the goals in their respective contexts. Through a survey and interviews with informants in Norwegian municipalities and county councils, this paper explores and offers new empirical insight into (1) which factors can be identified as facilitating the implementation of the SDGs in Norwegian local and regional planning; (2) how the facilitating factors are conditioned by the different local and regional institutional contexts; and (3) how these factors from the Norwegian context correspond or differ from those in the international literature. We find that the existing Planning and Building Act is considered a suitable framework for the implementation of the SDGs in the Norwegian context, and that the SDGs are high on the national and regional governmental agendas. However, work remains in integrating the SDGs into underlying governmental activities. They must be incorporated into action plans and planning tools, which will require involvement, collaboration and development work across sectors and authority levels, and the development of guidelines for how this can be done. Allocating enough resources for this work will be crucial, and smaller municipalities may need other types and degrees of support than larger ones.

AB  - Heritage management in infrastructure planning is in this paper regarded as a 'wicked problem'-A multidimensional and unpredictable activity infused with conflicting stakeholder perspectives. By focusing on the West Link and drawing on theoretical notions of strategy-as-practice, the aim is to identify the circumstances in which paradoxes and dilemmas of wicked problems emerge and examine the professional micro-level strategizing applied to navigate and overcome them. The railway construction was deemed to be a threat to the 17th century fortifications, historical parks and former agricultural properties, today located in the city center. The Swedish government appointed representatives from the Swedish Transport Administration and heritage professionals from national, regional and local levels of government to negotiate how best to deal with these challenges. By means of primary data from interviews and workshops with stakeholders, and document- and correspondence analysis, the results showed how three main challenges hampered a fruitful dialogue and outcome: the inherent complexity of the task, different approaches to heritage and lack of adequate coordination within and between the parties. Strategic responses included action plans, delegation of tasks in reference and working groups, the signing of agreements, reorganization and financing of additional personnel. We discuss the main factors underlining the wickedness of heritage management in infrastructure planning as both processual and collaborative, and the implications of this for practice regarding bringing about more operative and sustainable approaches.</p>

AB  - Research on sustainable tourism development in the context of islands has mainly focused on warm-water destinations. Because the concept of sustainability differs according to the type of the destination, this case study increases the understanding of sustainable tourism development in a cold-water destination. The Finnish archipelago was chosen as a case destination, since sustainability has become an important policy framework for the tourism industry in Finland. The findings show that economic sustainability is the most important and socio-cultural sustainability the most contradictory as well as the weakest sustainability dimension. In particular, the conflicts caused by the pivotal role of the municipality, the specifics in legislation, the Finns' emotional and personal relationship with nature and second home ownership emerge as the context-specific features in sustainable tourism development. These findings have important practical implications for the destination stakeholders when converting the intentions related to sustainable tourism development into practice.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse the critique that has accompanied sustained efforts made in recent years by the Government of Sweden to facilitate global investment in the country's mining sector. The minerals market in the 21st century has been characterized by increasing global prices. In Sweden, the largest mining nation within the EU, this has led to what has been identified as a mining boom. The governmental mining policy, aimed at attracting an increasing part of the global venture capital seeking to profit from the volatile but lucrative minerals market, has been met with growing domestic resistance, fuelled by what has been perceived as dangers and side effects of a rapidly expanding Swedish mining industry. This resistance has largely focused on the mineral strategy launched by the government in 2013, as it crystallized the neoliberal ideas judged by critics to severely jeopardize social, cultural, economic and environmental values. After a critical analysis of the mineral strategy, we go on to analyse the mining-critical discourse, concluding with a discussion where we highlight the main implications of the analysis and identify a possible path for compromise between proponents and opponents of the mineral strategy.

AB  - Efficiency in the use of resources stream-lined for expected conditions could lead to reduced system diversity and consequently endanger resilience. We tested the hypothesis of a trade-off between farm resource-use efficiency and land-use diversity. We applied stochastic frontier production models to assess the dependence of resource-use-efficiency on land-use diversity as illustrated by the Shannon-Weaver index. Total revenue in relation to use of capital, land and labour on the farms in Southern Finland with a size exceeding 30 ha was studied. The data were extracted from the Finnish Profitability Bookkeeping data. Our results indicate that there is either no trade-off or a negligible trade-off of no economic importance. The small dependence of resource-use efficiency on land-use diversity can be positive as well as negative. We conclude that diversification as a strategy to enhance farm resilience does not necessarily constrain resource-use efficiency.

AB  - Decline and long-term depression of mean densities of the grey-sided vole (Myodes rufocanus) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis) have occurred in managed forest landscapes of Sweden since the 1970s. Generally poor over-winter survival during a period with mild winters suggested a common climatic driver, but other explanations exist. Here we explore the response of the grey-sided vole, preferring forested habitats, and the field vole, preferring open habitats, to clear-cutting of old forest in Sweden. The cumulated impact from long-term clear-cutting explained local disappearances of the grey-sided vole. Maintained connectivity of old forest to stone fields was important for local population survival, since no such populations disappeared. For the grey-sided vole, it is probable that climate is not the dominating driver due to different timing of the decline in our study area. Instead, habitat loss is concluded as being a potential cause of the decline in mean density and depression of grey-sided vole densities. The long-lasting depression of field vole densities, despite favourable landscape changes, suggests action of another strong driver. A recent field vole recovery, essentially back to pre-decline densities and distribution, coincided with favourable winter/snow conditions, suggesting a climatic driver in this case.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

AB  - Norwegian Foreign Policy Until recently, Norwegian climate foreign policy has been relatively consensual. In the 2020s ??? the decisive decade for climate politics ??? the Norwegian stance is however being challenged. This is because a national precondition that until now has been Norway???s foremost strength, i.e., the renewable power system, can no longer uphold the same function in Norwegian climate foreign policy. The renewable power system and an active foreign policy emphasizing flexible mechanisms in international climate cooperation have preserved the legitimacy of Norwegian climate policies. However, in the future, climate policies will face dramatically sharpened demands, as reaching the climate goals will now also depend on electrification and industrial change. An energy transition that corresponds to the upgraded climate policy ambitions implies a climate foreign policy that needs to balance more concerns than in the past. There is now no element of climate policy that is domestic politics only. The North Sea is facing a major offshore wind power expansion. Irrespective of what Norway decides, a European offshore expansion will move Europe towards greater mutual interdependence, both physically in terms of border crossing infrastructure, and regulatory, through common rules and regulations for the sale of power across national borders. The more extensive the green energy transition becomes, the more obvious it is that Norwegian and European energy transitions are connected, and that this mutually interdependent energy transition constitutes one of the most important components of the climate policies of Norway and other states. This transition, however, triggers strong sovereignty impulses in many Norwegian political parties. A major Norwegian offshore wind power expansion raises controversial questions about financing, how and where to connect the wind parks to the grid, and subsea cable connections. There is a considerable likelihood that Norwegian offshore wind policy will be characterized by major political tugs-of-war. Energy transition is now a completely necessary part of the development of Norwegian climate foreign policy. This implies a foreign policy that challenges Norwegian sovereignty to a far greater extent than before, which potentially moves Norwegian climate foreign policy from continuity and consensus to disagreement and strife.

AB  - The last decades impressively demonstrated the extraordinary instability of secondary stands of Norway spruce. New concepts of forest management are now considered, mostly including the conversion of unnatural pure spruce forests to mixed or deciduous forests. Entomological problems are substantially touched by such approach to more natural conditions at least in two points: biodiversity and forest protection. Thus, forest entomology is challenged to assist forestry supplying constructive expertise. This is particularly necessary with montane forests, which require very differentiated considerations. A brief survey of the threatenings by insects, to which Norway spruce is exposed at different altitudes of the montane region, demonstrates the relief which can be expected from forest conversions. The transitional stage bears special risks, since a temporary destabilization of forests may provoke excessive damage also by insects. Reintroduction of admired or alternative tree species may be accompanied by new tree-specific pest problems. Within certain limitations, leaving dead trees for raising animal diversity in forests can be reconciled with the necessities of forest protection.

AB  - The value of interdisciplinarity for solving complex coastal problems is widely recognized. Many early career researchers (ECRs) therefore actively seek this type of collaboration through choice or necessity, for professional development or project funding. However, establishing and conducting interdisciplinary research collaborations as an ECR has many challenges. Here, we identify these challenges through the lens of ECRs working in different disciplines on a common ecosystem, the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. The most densely populated coastline in Norway, the Skagerrak coast, is experiencing a multitude of anthropogenic stressors including fishing, aquaculture, eutrophication, climate change, land runoff, development, and invasive species. The Skagerrak coastline has also been the focus of environmental science research for decades, much of which aims to inform management of these stressors. The region provides a fantastic opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, both within and beyond the environmental sciences. This perspective article identifies the barriers ECRs in Norway face in establishing interdisciplinary and collaborative research to inform management of coastal ecosystems, along with their root causes. We believe our discussion will be of broad interest to all research institutions who employ or educate ECRs (in Norway and worldwide), and to those who develop funding mechanisms for ECRs and interdisciplinary research.

AB  - The academic databases such as Scopus or Web of Science are commonly used to measure performance of universities, departments, and even single researchers. However, to what extent such databases can represent real outcomes of aforementioned units especially in the field of art and humanities where local languages and cultural phenomena play an important role is not clear. This article focuses on understanding how research in this field, as seen through the case of aesthetics in non-English speaking countries, Finland in particular, is represented through major academic databases. This question is tackled by applying a data mining approach. First, we identify major academic databases, and afterwards test what is the proportion of Finnish aesthetics presented in those databases. Our approach allows us to critically look into representation of local art or humanities related research in general academic databases, and understand to what extent we can trust those sources in representing real pictures of the field. Results strengthen the well-known fact that most common academic databases draw a rather poor picture. In more particular this article shows that there are certain factors that influence analysis of the field: (1) spread data, (2) multilingual content, (3) non-standard categorization, (4) variability of venues, (5) different publishing patterns, and (6) unsuitable impact metrics. However, our results propose that alternative databases can be formed from university or meta-data databases. We also provide further directions for designing of such databases.

AB  - Blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is often promoted for its co-benefits and multifunctionality. However, this infrastructure is repeatedly planned, implemented and researched almost entirely based on the goals of stormwater management. Thus, more knowledge is required about how co-benefits are perceived and actioned by planning actors. By investigating co-benefits from a value perspective, this paper will contribute to the ongoing debate on how stormwater planning actors address the potential co-benefits and conflicts in the planning and implementation of BGI. The data are derived from policy document analyses and interviews with municipal and private planning actors in Bergen and Tromso, Norway. The paper argues that municipal water actors are motivated to implement BGI beyond stormwater management goals and approach co-benefits and holistic stormwater management as an ideal in stormwater planning. However, the tensions and conflicts between the co-benefits become more evident in the actual implementation of BGI. The paper finds that when holistic BGI implementation is initiated by the municipal water actors, the stormwater management aspects dominate the BGI implementation. Finally, the paper concludes that even though blue and green values and interests are often conflicted in the implementation of BGI, urban stormwater planning is in the process of developing a blue-green value set based on the potential synergies of co-benefits. The paper therefore empirically illustrates how collective values and interests can develop and unfold across sectors and professional disciplines in BGI planning.

AB  - Background Intraprofessional collaboration necessitates understanding and knowledge on how nurses perceive each other and what factors promote good collaboration. The relationship between nurse-nurse collaboration has been explored relatively little, though intraprofessional collaboration is an essential factor for a healthy work environment. Aim This study explores the Finnish and the Norwegian nurses' perceptions of nurse-nurse collaboration in nursing care and factors associated with those perceptions. Design A cross-sectional quantitative study design. Methods In 2015, data were collected from 406 Finnish and Norwegian RNs in two acute-care hospitals, by employing the Dougherty and Larson's Nurse-Nurse Collaboration Scale (NNCS). Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, Pearson's chi-Square tests and multivariate anova were used for analysis. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from ethics committees in both countries. Results Findings indicated that the perception of nurse-nurse collaboration was good in both countries. However, significant inter-country differences were found in the collaboration subscales. Compared with their Finnish counterparts, Norwegian nurses awarded higher scores to conflict management, communication, shared process, coordination and professionalism. The results suggest that nurse characteristics, such as main working time and total work experience, were related to the perception of collaboration. Conclusion The subscales with the highest scores in both countries were professionalism, shared process and communication. Factors such as conflict management and coordination are areas which should be emphasised to achieve good collaboration between nurses. Here, nurse leaders play an important part in assessing and improving RN-RN collaboration.

KW  - WATER
AB  - Forest management affects the distribution of tree species and the age class of a forest, shaping its overall structure and functioning and in turn the surface-atmosphere exchanges of mass, energy, and momentum. In order to attribute climate effects to anthropogenic activities like forest management, good accounts of forest structure are necessary. Here, using Fennoscandia as a case study, we make use of Fennoscandic National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to systematically classify forest cover into groups of similar aboveground forest structure. An enhanced forest classification scheme and related lookup table (LUT) of key forest structural attributes (i.e., maximum growing season leaf area index (LAI(max)), basal-area-weighted mean tree height, tree crown length, and total stem volume) was developed, and the classification was applied for multisource NFI (MS-NFI) maps from Norway, Sweden, and Finland. To provide a complete surface representation, our product was integrated with the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI LC) map of present day land cover (v.2.0.7). Comparison of the ESA LC and our enhanced LC products (https://doi.org/10.21350/7zZEy5w3) showed that forest extent notably (kappa = 0.55, accuracy 0.64) differed between the two products. To demonstrate the potential of our enhanced LC product to improve the description of the maximum growing season LAI (LAI(max)) of managed forests in Fennoscandia, we compared our LAI(max) map with reference LAI(max) maps created using the ESA LC product (and related cross-walking table) and PFT-dependent LAI(max) values used in three leading land models. Comparison of the LAI(max) maps showed that our product provides a spatially more realistic description of LAI(max) in managed Fennoscandian forests compared to reference maps. This study presents an approach to account for the transient nature of forest structural attributes due to human intervention in different land models.

AB  - Historical baselines of forest cover are needed to understand the causes and consequences of recent changes and to assess the effectiveness of land-use policies. However, historical assessment of the global distribution of forest cover and change has been lacking due to obstacles in image acquisition, computational demands, and lack of retrospective reference data for image classification. As limitations of access to imagery and computational power are overcome, the possibility is increased of an automated retrospective classification of forest cover. We used locally fit classification trees to relate hind-cast observations of "stable pixels" of forest and non-forest cover from circa-2000 to Landsat spectral measurements taken from the circa-1990 epoch of the Global Land Survey collection of Landsat images. Based on analysis of nearly 30,000 Landsat images, forest-cover change between 1990 and 2000 epochs was detected based on joint probabilities of cover in the two epochs. Assessed across a sample of areas with coincident reference data in the conterminous United States, the resulting maps achieved 93% accuracy for forest cover and 84% for forest-cover change comparable or even higher than many previous national efforts. Global accuracy assessment likewise showed accuracy of 88% for forest-cover change. The maps depict the global distribution of gross gains and losses in forest cover, as well as their net change. The initial analysis showed strong effects of extant land use in temperate regions and land-use change in the tropics over the period, while wildfire dominated in the boreal zone. Regions of high net forest loss (e.g., Amazonia) were associated with land-use changes into agriculture, and regions of high gross gains and losses (e.g., southeastern US, Sweden) were associated with intensive forestry. These results, including the global forest cover and forest cover change datasets, will be a basis for the estimation of the efficacy of policies and analyzing correlation between forest cover change and socio-economic factors.

AB  - Background: Since the 1960s, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and recently, social impact assessments (SIAs), have been conducted during the planning stages of large development projects to identify potential adverse effects and propose mitigation measures to ameliorate these impacts. EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible positive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, including biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
   Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https://osf.io/cvh3u/) and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text. Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts, and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitigation measures from practitioners' knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges including scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners' knowledge.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) is frequently cited as a planning strategy which facilitates sustainability transitions on urban and regional levels. Its supporters emphasize its innovative nature, but this tends to downplay the importance of the long history of transit-oriented strategies. This study examined whether scrutinizing planning history, particularly regarding rural-urban interplay, can differentiate TOD strategies and facilitate a discussion on desirable kinds of future TOD. The analysis used the case of the town Skurup in Sweden, tracing its partial dependencies on past planning and urban development through archival studies, maps, interviews and field studies. Particular attention was paid to the establishment of the rurban village in the late 19th century and to modern planning in the 1960s. It was concluded that the divergence from the TOD strategy of the former period and the similarities with modern planning need to be critically discussed in developing future TOD strategies. Based on the case, strategies for going beyond modern planning and referring more clearly to earlier TOD approaches are suggested, not least in order to maintain the cultural heritage of the town and its hinterland.

AB  - In this paper, we critically examine the co-management of Indigenous peoples' cultural heritage as simultaneously a driver and product of the culturalisation of Indigenous peoples: the reduction of complex legal-political orders, anchored in specific lands, value systems, rights, and practices, to material cultures. Co-management has been hailed as a defensibly imperfect, 'tweakable' system that benefits both Indigenous and state parties, and moreover, a stepping stone to Indigenous self-determination. Departing from these analyses, we argue that co-management is not just an administrative arrangement but also a state-ratified international rights regime, and accordingly, that it cannot do other than undermine Indigenous self-determination and imperil Indigenous peoples' cultural heritage. We suggest that cultural heritage can only thrive by being actively engaged with in situ: via the living practice of Indigenous governance. Operationalising our argument, we first consider the challenges of cultural heritage protection in Sapmi; specifically, the co-management of Laponia, in Sweden, and the unprotected sacred area of Suttesaja in Finland. We then discuss a more promising framework: the Quechua 'Biocultural Heritage Territory' of the Parque de la Papa, in Peru. Finally, we apply the lessons of the Parque to Suttesaja, showing how this opens up governance-based avenues to safeguarding Indigenous sacred areas.

AB  - We present in individual-based model of the Norwegian wolf Canis lupus population, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of current and potential management policies in fulfilling the Norwegian Government's stated aim of maintaining three breeding packs within a designated wolf zone. The model estimates the 'functional extinction rate' of the population, defined as the proportion of years in which breeding wolf packs are absent. Under the current conditions according to estimates from Scandinavia, with observed values of natural survival rates (0.903) and unauthorised mortality (0.203) and allowing for immigration from Sweden, the model predicts that the probability of functional extinction is as low as 0.07. This output variable is highly sensitive to the demographic parameters, and if alternative estimates of natural survival rates (0.73 for cubs and 0.83 for adults) reported for wolves elsewhere and higher rates of unauthorised mortality (0.4) are utilised, the functional extinction rate is 0.67 +/- 0.15, and the population is dependent on maintenance by immigration from Sweden. The main determinants of the functional extinction rate are file unauthorised mortality rate and the immigration rate from Sweden. The Scandinavian population as a whole shows a rapid non-linear increase in probability of extinction at unauthorised mortality rates >0.10. Varying levels of the current management interventions (increasing the size of the wolf zone and target number of packs) are ineffective only when the Unauthorised mortality rate falls below 0.30 is a self-sustaining Population in Norway able to establish. An adaptive harvest policy with culls targeted only at dispersing animals, or taking place only when the population exceeds a threshold level, could be sustainable if the Unauthorised mortality rate is reduced. The fact that the Norwegian Government has been explicit about its management strategy and objectives has allowed us to test the ability of this strategy to meet the objectives, and we have shown that it is dependant upon maintaining the current circumstances alongside a high adult survival rate to be able to do so. Given the potentially critical role of the Swedish population in Sustaining Norway's wolves, there is a strong case for joint management of the Scandinavian population. These insights are likely to be relevant for the management of other species living across geopolitical boundaries.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major reason for the decline and extinction of migratory species. Many host populations for parasites are partly migratory, consisting of both migratory and resident individuals, and we asked the question whether these two subpopulations differ in parasite susceptibility. If so, barriers intercepting migration may change the parasite encystment rate and recruitment. We used the River Ljungan, Sweden, as study system, where eight hydroelectric power plants hinder access of sea-migrating trout to most tributaries. We compared the encystment of the threatened freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) larvae on sympatric tributary-resident brown trout and sea-migrating trout (Salmo trutta) as hosts for their parasitic larvae. We also compared eighteen tributary-resident brown trout populations with the sea-migrating trout as hosts for mussel larvae. Encystment decreased faster over time on the tributary-resident trout than on the sea-migrating trout. Encystment was therefore higher on the sea-migrating trout compared to the tributary-resident trout at the time of excystment of the larvae. Growth of encysted mussel larvae was higher on the sea-migrating trout than on the tributary-resident trout. The natural density of the tributary-resident trout populations was lower than that of the sea-migrating trout in the autumn, when the mussels infest the fish, and in early summer, just before the excystment of juvenile mussels from the fish. Estimations of total numbers of encysted mussel larvae per unit stream area were higher on the sea-migrating trout than the tributary-resident trout in the autumn and in the spring at the time of juvenile mussel excystment. The higher mussel larval growth and the higher encystment on the sea-migrating trout imply that even seemingly healthy tributary mussel populations are reduced because of the habitat fragmentation. As sea-migrating trout are threatened or extinct in many rivers, fragmentation may be a large-scale problem, not only for sea-migrating populations, but also indirectly for highly threatened mussel populations. Restoration activities should primarily focus on creating free pathways for original host fish populations instead of sustaining them by supplementary stocking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban forest patches are generally small with highly contrasting edges bordering non-forest habitat, landscape features that increase with urbanisation. These forest patches are also subject to high human foot traffic resulting in trampling and other user disturbances that affect their quality as habitat for invertebrates. We studied the effects of these factors on carabid beetles in urban forests in the cities of Helsinki (Finland) and Edmonton (Canada). In both cities, the structure of carabid assemblages was affected by trampling intensity and distance to the forest edge. Moderate intensity of trail use was associated with increased beetle captures, especially in Edmonton. The effects on individual species were apparent in Edmonton but harder to demonstrate in Helsinki where forest specialist species may have been largely extirpated already. We suggest that these differences result because there has been a long history of fragmentation of urban forest patches in Helsinki, species loss from such patches is gradual, and understorey vegetation structure constrains human foot traffic in forest patches more in Edmonton than it does in Helsinki.

AB  - New knowledge challenges long-established practices of fish stocking and transfer because of increasing scientific consensus that the release of cultivated fish can pose risks to biodiversity; however, stocking can also improve fisheries, creating difficult decision trade-offs regarding its use. Accordingly, controversy persists about fish stocking and transfer. No studies, however, have embraced a multinational perspective to understand the important governance dimensions of the success and failure of salmonid stocking and transfer policies. The present study has analysed the historical development and contemporary governance of the stocking and transfer of native and non-native salmonids of the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and Oncorhynchus in five legislative units around the North Atlantic Ocean: the Atlantic Provinces of Canada, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. The study is based on the analyses of published and unpublished literature, and a survey of experts. Current salmonid stocking policies and practices varied significantly among jurisdictions; the degree of policy change varied, from radical and rapid changes de jure and de facto in Atlantic Canada and Norway to incremental mostly de jure changes in France and Germany. Rapid policy change in Atlantic Canada, Norway, and partly in Sweden can be explained by the socio-political importance of salmonid fisheries, stocking regulations based on policy objectives to conserve wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), well-documented examples of the harmful consequences of transfers of non-native species, and well-developed vertical governance linkages. The policy changes resemble that of the 'punctuated equilibrium policy framework'. By contrast, France and Germany place less socio-political emphasis on salmonids, have stocking regulations less directed at wild salmonids, more local-level decision making, more species-rich fish communities, and little evidence of adverse ecological impacts of the transfer and stocking of salmonids. This has led to small, incremental changes in stocking policy de facto that are reflective of the 'advocacy coalition policy framework'.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies) is one of the most important target trees in forestry. In Central Europe, it is grown primarily in forest plantations. However, the distribution area of this tree species is declining due to climate change and trends toward sustainable forest management. The question how artificial habitats such as plantations influence the native biota is still unclear. We aimed to investigate the influence of spruce plantations on bird communities at the country level. We focused on birds in relation to biotic, stand and land use characteristics. We studied bird communities (including woodpeckers) throughout the Czech Republic. All sites were situated in mature spruce forest plantations. Birds were sampled using the point count method, and nine environmental predictors were considered to potentially affect the bird community. Our results indicate that the representation of deciduous trees (within stands and in the surroundings) and longhorn beetles (as prey) have a predominant effect on the species richness of birds, including woodpeckers. The effects of longhorns and deciduous trees in the stand were positive, while deciduous forests in the surroundings had a negative effect. We also found several species associated with spruce, even in plantation forests. An important finding regarding the future management of spruce stands is that bird communities exhibited a strong relationship with spruce, even outside of its native range. Admixture with deciduous trees was favorable at the stand level, while at the landscape level, there is the need for adequate spruce-dominated forests, and deciduous forests may serve as obstacles. We argue that plantations cannot only be seen as tree farms or green deserts but also be used for biodiversity management. Nevertheless, it is important to leave deciduous trees within the stand until the end of the rotation period, as birds find food and nesting places in these trees.

AB  - In this article, we explore a cultural change which has made the desire to live close to nature from a core tenet of Norwegian culture to an unsustainable threat to nature. During the last two decades, Norwegian cabin tourism has moved from 'hard' forms (few, prolonged stays, strong identification with the site) of ecotourism to 'softer' ones (shorter, more frequent stays, commercialisation of the site). These changes, we argue, have led to a situation in which the image of an ideal cabin which echoes hard ecotourism is perpetuated within new, softer practices. Unfortunately, this new kind of nature tourism, which is characterised by many short stays of many uncoordinated visitors spread over preferably 'pristine' nature, is inherently unsustainable. As an alternative, we propose more cautious transitions to more coordinated and 'denser' forms of tourism, which are exemplified in two cases.

AB  - As climate change has driven dramatic changes in Northern sea ice regimes, marine mammals have gained iconic status around the world reflecting the perils of global warming. There is a tension between policies that have international support like a ban on seal hunting or whaling, and the adoption of adaptive, flexible rules that are likely to work in Northern places. Whereas most wildlife policy focuses on biological information to inform policy strategy, this analysis focuses on the "human dimensions" of Northern marine mammal management. This research examines ways in which human relationships and modes of governance affect conservation success. Standard analyses of risk to animal populations focused on direct sources of take are inadequate to address multi-causal, complex problems such as climate-induced habitat loss or increased industrialization of the Arctic Ocean. Early conservation policy strategies focusing on the moratorium of take have eliminated or reduced such practices as commercialized hunting and high levels of fisheries bycatch, but may be less relevant in an era in which habitats and climate changes are key drivers of population dynamics. This paper argues that effective adaptive policy requires new ways of learning about and governing human interactions with marine mammals. Through an exploration of marine mammal management in three Northern regions (Alaska, Nunavut, and the Finnish Baltic Sea coast), the paper analyzes the extent to which these marine mammal management regimes are practicing adaptive governance, that is, building cross-scale (local to international) understanding while allowing actors at the local scale the flexibility to direct the creation of rules that are ecologically robust and likely to succeed. Lessons are taken from these examples and used to propose selected policy and research recommendations for the marine mammal policy community. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The prospects of rapid climate change and the potential existence of tipping points in marine ecosystems where nonlinear change may result from them being overstepped, raises the question of strategies for coping with ecosystem change. There is broad agreement that the combined forces of climate change, pollution and increasing economic activities necessitates more comprehensive approaches to oceans management, centering on the concept of ecosystem-based oceans management. This article addresses the Norwegian experience in introducing integrated, ecosystem-based oceans management, emphasizing how climate change, seen as a major long-term driver of change in ecosystems, is addressed in management plans. Understanding the direct effects of climate variability and change on ecosystems and indirect effects on human activities is essential for adaptive planning to be useful in the long-term management of the marine environment.

AB  - The impact of forest management on biodiversity is difficult to scrutinize along gradients of management. A step towards analyzing the impact of forest management on biodiversity is comparisons between managed and primary forests. The standardized typology of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) is a multi-taxon indicator used to quantify forest biodiversity. We aim to analyze the influence of environmental factors on the occurrence of groups of TreMs by comparing primary and managed forests. We collected data for the managed forests in the Black Forest (Germany) and for the primary forests in the Western (Slovakia) and Southern Carpathians (Romania). To model the richness and the different groups of TreMs per tree, we used generalized linear mixed models with diameter at breast height (DBH), altitude, slope and aspect as predictors for European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)) and silver fir (Abies alba (Mill.)) in primary and managed temperate mountain forests. We found congruent results for overall richness and the vast majority of TreM groups. Trees in primary forests hosted a greater richness of all and specific types of TreMs than individuals in managed forests. The main drivers of TreMs are DBH and altitude, while slope and aspect play a minor role. We recommend forest and nature conservation managers to focus: 1) on the conservation of remaining primary forests and 2) approaches of biodiversity-oriented forest management on the selection of high-quality habitat trees that already provide a high number of TreMs in managed forests based on the comparison with primary forests.

KW  - BIRD COMMUNITIES
AB  - Territory establishment and habitat use by breeding Curlews Numenius arquata were studied during I987 and I988 on mosaic farmland (dominated by dry tillage) at two sites in central Sweden. Curlews preferred to breed in areas with a high proportion of grassland, close to rivers, while dry tillage was avoided. Territories at my study site were larger (mean = 45.2 ha) than in areas consisting entirely of grassland. Territory size seemed to depend on the spatial distribution of grasslands, which suggests that habitat fragmentation forces Curlews to establish larger territories in modem farmland than in areas of grassland. The number of territories in patches of grassland was correlated with patch area, and unoccupied patches were more isolated than occupied patches. However, patch area was a more important factor than isolation, since large patches (> 35 ha) were always occupied. Sown grassland was used significantly more than expected for foraging early in the season, possibly indicating the strong influence of the nutritional requirements in the pre-breeding period on territory establishment. Habitat selection when foraging seemed to be less important late in the season, since there was no significant habitat preference then. During this period distance to the nest site seemed to be more important than habitat, sinced the preferred foraging fields (including fields of all habitats used more than expected by area) were situated closer to nests than the less preferred fields, probably an adaptation to the high nest predation risk. The same fields were mostly preferred in the pre-breeding period also, suggesting that nests were built close to good foraging areas.
   My results indicate that the decline of the Swedish Curlew population since I950 is caused by changes in land use, resulting in decreased grassland area and increased habitat fragmentation, which probably have affected both breeding and foraging possibilities negatively.

AB  - This paper addresses the role of standardization in risk governance and explores challenges when unifying different system logics and standardizations in the regulator-regulated relationships in different industrial, political, and cultural contexts. High-risk regulatory regimes have been at the forefront in developing regulations management, founded on function-, purpose- and goal-based regulations. A key perspective in our analysis is to examine the importance of "standardization" as an institutional approach and regulatory mechanism. The new era of free trade and globalization causes constant reorganization in industries that are trying to seize opportunities and increase competitiveness. The high-risk industries today, therefore, are undergoing major changes, due to downsizing and mergers, which inevitably affect and challenge their safety levels. The paper bases its discussion on several empirical studies of industrial dynamics and innovation in petroleum, mainly from the empirical context of the North Sea petroleum region.

AB  - Numerous studies in urban resilience have been published in the past decade. However, only a few publications have tracked the evolution trends of urban resilience research, the findings of which can serve as a useful guide for scholars to foresee worth-effort research areas and make the best use of precious time and resources. In order to fill the research gap, this study performed a scientometric analysis on the evolution trends of urban resilience research using a versatile software package-CiteSpace. The scientomentric analysis focuses on distribution of lead authors and their institutions, high frequency categories and keywords, high influential journals, author contribution, and evolutionary trends based on co-author analysis, co-word analysis, co-citation analysis and cluster analysis of documents. This study discoveries that first, the U.S., England, Australia, Canada, China and Sweden are the countries that make the most significant contributions in the advancement of urban resilience research; second, the existing urban resilience research focuses primarily on environmental studies, geography and planning development; third, hot topics of the urban resilience research keep shifting from 1993 to 2016; fourth, the knowledge body of urban resilience research consists of five clusters: resilience exploratory analysis, disaster resilience, urban resilience, urban resilience practice, and social-ecological systems; last, the emerging trends in urban resilience research include defining urban resilience, adaptation model, case studies, analytical methods and urban social-ecological systems, resulting in cutting-edge research areas in urban resilience.

AB  - The aim of this study is apply available methods to assess impacts on biodiversity from the land use caused by plantation grown radiata pine in New Zealand in a life cycle assessment framework. This is done both to quantify the impact as well as compare the results obtained by different methods.
   Data on location and productivity for wood supply regions in New Zealand was assessed using three methods identified as relevant for the purpose. All data were related to a functional unit of 1 m(3) of timber production.
   The results show both a significant difference in impact on biodiversity from land use in the different wood supply regions and a significant difference in the results from the three applied methods. Although some of the results obtained from the three methods were correlated, this was not consistent through all the results. The methodological variation emanates from the treatment of the characteristics of the wood supply regions and underlying assumptions, e.g. reference vegetation. Compared to a case study in Norway, the impact on biodiversity from plantation forestry in New Zealand is found to be relatively low following the applied methods and assumptions taken.
   The study shows a significant variation in how impacts on biodiversity are assessed following different approaches. Research to harmonize methods to quantify impact on biodiversity is recommended, as well as exploring effects of different weighting of crucial aspects of biodiversity, such as rarity, abundance and species richness.

AB  - The paper is concerned incorporating landscapes ecological and cultural values in infrastructure planning. We focus on cultural heritage connectivity in the context of environmental impact statements in transportation infrastructure planning. Using a case study from south-central Sweden cultural heritage indicators from maps were defined, and a GIS-based automated search tool is developed for analysing cultural heritage connectivity from an antiquarian perspective. Analyses of cultural heritage connectivity can inform about the historical and/or present function of the landscape and its social and economic conditions. While this type of connectivity can be searched out using information from maps, a difficulty lies in communicating the knowledge in an interesting way to non-experts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat conservation, and hence conservation of biodiversity hinges on knowledge of the spatial distribution of habitats, not least those that are particularly valuable or vulnerable. In offshore Norway, benthic habitats are systematically surveyed and described by the national programme MAREANO (Marine AREA' database for NOrwegian waters). Benthic habitats and biotopes are defined in terms of the species composition of their epibenthic megafauna. Some habitats are of special conservation interest on account of their intrinsic value and/or vulnerability (e.g., long-lived species, rareness, to comply with international regulations such as OSPAR). In Norway, off Nordland and Troms, the following habitats of special interest can be found: Umbaula encrinus Stands, Radicipes sp. Meadows, Deep Sea Sponge Aggregations, Seapen and Burrowing Megafauna Communities, Hard Bottom Coral Gardens. In this paper, we used underwater video data collected within the MAREANO programme to define and describe benthic habitats and biotopes of special interest, and to map the geographic distribution thereof by means of habitat modelling.
   We first evaluated the community structure of each habitat in the list using a SIMPROF test. We determined that the class Deep Sea Sponge Aggregations, as defined by OSPAR, had to be split into at least three classes. We then re-defined seven new types of ecological features, including habitats and biotopes that were sufficiently homogeneous. Then we modelled the spatial distributions of these habitats and biotopes using Conditional Inference Forests. Since the purpose of the distribution maps is to support spatial planning we classified the heat maps using density thresholds.
   The accuracy of models ranged from fair to excellent. Hard Bottom Coral Gardens were the most rare habitat in terms of total area predicted (224 km(2), 0.3% of the area modelled), closely followed by Radicipes Meadows (391 km(2), 0.6%). Soft Bottom Demosponges (Geodid sponges and other taxa) represent the largest habitat, with a predicted area of 9288 km(2) (14%). Distribution maps of classes defined by habitat-forming species (Hard Bottom Coral Gardens) were more reliable than those defined by a host of species, or where no single species was a clear habitat provider (e.g. Seapen and Burrowing Megafauna Communities). We also put forward that a scale of patchiness larger than the scale of observation, and homogeneity of the community both play a role in model performance, and hence in map usefulness. These along with density threshold values based on observed data should all be taken into account in marine classifications and habitat definitions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we examine the influence of geographical and land-use factors on breeding bird species richness in small woods within farmland. In many European agricultural landscapes, small woods represent the major component of semi-natural habitat available to wildlife. We used census data (for woods of up to 15 ha) from six study areas in four countries (The Netherlands, U.K., Denmark and Norway) to construct species-area relationships for woodland birds. An additional relationship for Sweden was obtained from the literature. Species richness, and the parameters of the species-area relationships, were then related to the latitude, longitude and percentage woodland cover of each study area. Overall, species richness across all woods in each study area declined with increasing latitude; the proportion of resident species also declined, but that of migrants increased. Numbers of migrant species also increased with increasing woodland cover. Both the slopes and intercepts of the species-area relationships declined with increasing latitude. Thus not only were fewer species available to colonise individual woods at higher latitudes, but the return in terms of species richness for a given increase in area was also less than at lower latitudes. From the species-area relationships, the numbers of species expected to breed in woods of 1 ha and of 15 ha decreased from 13 and 21, respectively, in The Netherlands (latitude 51.7 degrees) to 7 and 13, respectively, in Denmark (latitude 56.3 degrees). Other factors influencing species richness on both local and geographical scales are discussed.

AB  - Monitoring of forest biodiversity and habitats is an important part of forest conservation, but due to the impossible task of monitoring all species, indicator species are frequently used. However, reliance on an incorrect indicator of valuable habitat can reduce the efficiency of conservation efforts. Birds are often used as indicators as they are charismatic, relatively easy to survey, and because we often have knowledge of their habitat and resource requirements. In the Swedish government's environmental quality goals, there are a number of bird species identified as being associated with 'older' and 'high natural value' forests. Here we evaluate the occurrence of four of these indicator species using data from 91 production forest stands and 10 forest reserves in southern Sweden. The bird species assessed are willow tit Poecile montanus, coal tit Periparus ater, European crested tit Lophophanes cristatus and Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris. For the production stands assessed, these indicator species exhibited no significant preferences regarding forest composition and structure, indicating a wider range of habitat associations than expected. These species frequently showed territorial behavior in forest stands <60 and even 40 years of age; much younger than the 120-year threshold for 'older forest' as defined by governmental environmental goals. As almost 80% of the production stands >= 10 years old included at least one of the four indicator species, this raises questions regarding the suitability of these species as indictors of forests of high conservational value in southern Sweden. Notably, besides the four species assessed here, none of the additional indicator taxa identified by the government, were recorded in the 10 reserves. This outcome may reflect the difficulties involved in finding bird indicator species indicative of high natural values in this region. Our results highlight the importance of coupling bird surveys with quantified assessments of proximate vegetation cover.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of forest habitats have been considered to pose a worldwide threat to the viability of forest-dwelling animals, especially to species that occupy old forests. We investigated whether the annual survival of sedentary male Tengmalm's owls Aegolius funereus was associated with the cover of old coniferous forests in Finland. Survival and recapture probabilities varied annually with density changes in populations of the main prey (Microtus voles). When this variation was controlled for, and relationships between survival and proportions of the three different forest age classes (old-growth, middle-aged, and young) were modeled separately, the old-growth model was the most parsimonious. Survival increased with the cover of old forest, although the extent of old forest within owl territories was relatively small (mean similar to 12%, range 2-37%). This association, however, varied among years and appeared especially in years of increasing vole abundance. At such times, old forests may sustain high populations of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus, shrews and small passerines. In addition, old forests may serve as refuges against large avian predator species, such as Ural owls Strix uralensis and goshawks Accipiter gentilis. Our results suggest that changes in habitat quality created by agriculture and forestry may have the potential to reduce adult survival, an essential component of fitness and population viability.

AB  - The preservation of key habitats is included in modern forest-management practices as one of the main means to preserve biodiversity in northern European production forests. I examined the distribution patterns and persistence of occurrence of rare epiphytic macrolichens in a predominantly unprotected forest landscape with an area of 278 km(2) in southern Finland. Occurrence data of macrolichens in two key habitats, rock outcrops and mires, were compared with data from production forests. The density of populations of rare macrolichens was 50-fold higher on rock outcrops and 25-fold higher on mires than in production forests. Most rare species of epiphytic macrolichens were found only in key habitats. In modern, intensively managed forest landscapes, rock outcrops appeared to represent the main habitats for rare macrolichens as a result of the long-term continuity of old trees. Most macrolichen occurrences represented very small populations with a high extinction risk. Of the populations found in 1989-1995 in key habitats, 51% had disappeared, by 2000-2001, mainly as a result of forestry activities. The disappearance of populations significantly exceeded the rate of establishment of new populations. My results emphasize the guidelines for delimiting and managing key habitats in order to halt the continued decline of epiphytic macrolichens.

AB  - Replacement cost refers to the loss incurred if the ideal set of conservation areas cannot be protected due to compulsory inclusion or exclusion of some area candidates. This cost can be defined either in terms of loss of conservation value or in terms of extra acquisition cost, and it has a clear mathematical definition as a difference between the value of the unconstrained optimal solution and a constrained suboptimal solution. In this work we for the first time show how replacement cost can be calculated in the context of sequential reserve selection, where a reserve network is developed over a longer time period and ongoing habitat loss influences retention and availability of sites. In case of site exclusion, a question that can be asked is, "if a site belonging to the ideal (optimal) solution cannot be obtained, what expected loss in reserve network value does this entail by the end of the planning period given that the rest of the solution is re-organized in the most advantageous manner?" Heuristically, the proposed method achieves the ambit of combining irreplaceability and vulnerability into one score of site importance. We applied replacement cost analysis to conservation prioritization for wood-inhabiting fungi in Norway, identifying factors that influence replacement cost and urgency of site acquisition. Among other things we find that the reliability of loss rate information is important, because the optimal site acquisition order may be strongly influenced by underestimated loss rates.

AB  - Forestry practices such as afforestation of former agricultural lands and early forest thinning are applied in several countries. These management strategies increase wood production potential and expand forest areas. However, knowledge of the impact of these practices on the diversity and resilience of soil fungal communities is scarce. This study investigated soil fungal community composition of young (21-40 years-old) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated stands located in Latvia and Estonia. The study includes data from 62 sampling sites and 2480 soil cores. Fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicons (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA region) of DNA extracted from forest floor and fine soil fractions were sequenced using the PacBio sequencing platform. 3176 quality filtered OTUs were detected, and 73.9% of these were identified as fungi. Fungal community composition was mainly differentiated based on soil pH and sampling site. Regarding former land use, relative abundance of the genus Solicoccozyma was higher in samples from former agricultural sites and some species from genera Cortinarius and Russula were identified as more indicative of particular former land use. Litter saprotrophic fungi and fungi of the genus Thelephora were significantly more highly represented in unmanaged sites than in sites where thinning was performed. In conclusion, differences among soil fungal communities are mainly influenced by soil pH and sampling site. Former land use and management have a significant effect on specific genera of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi.

AB  - Sustainable urban logistics is imperative to meet urban sustainability goals. In the European context, the European Union (EU) set an ambitious target in 2011 of essentially CO2-free urban logistics by 2030. However, it is unclear how effectively such EU targets for urban logistics have shaped national- and urban-level policymaking. This paper investigates whether there is evidence of localization of these supranational goals for urban logistics at the national and local levels. Drawing on the 'steering effects' framework, we seek such effects across four dimensions-institutional, discursive, relational and resources. Empirically, we conduct a thematic analysis of transport-related documents across three governance levels-the EU, the national level of Norway and the local level comprising four Norwegian cities. Our findings show that the EU's urban logistics goals are reflected in changing policy behaviour at the national and local levels over time. Yet this is more evident in some areas than in others: the discursive effect is most evident at both the national and local levels, whereas the institutional effects at both these levels remain fragmented and weak. Therefore, the EU's goalsetting does matter, but we have yet to see strong effects beyond the discursive.

AB  - This essay is focusing how the strategic communication about the COVID-19 pandemic created tensions between Sweden and Norway, nations that from an outside view are very much alike when it comes to political, economic and cultural aspects. Both countries, together with Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, belong to the Nordic region, with a common history, plenty of collaboration forms and high levels of trade exchange, as well as a common high level of trust in society and governments. In the essay secondary data (news media content and national statistics) is used to describe and analyze how the communication battle between Norway and Sweden developed. It is concluded that it is possible to see the handling of the pandemic, and the strategic communication about this, as part of a grand and negative narrative about Sweden's societal development since the 1990s. Sweden has in some aspects become a negative international projection surface for many countries. From a public diplomacy approach the pandemic led to constant international comparisons, providing states both risks and opportunities. Drawing comparisons between states risks alienating certain publics, opens one to attacks from other countries and may harm a nation's image.

AB  - Fifty-two cities, sixty-three businesses, and several universities have become living laboratories for ambitious climate mitigation programs. By 2050, the total annual emissions for the fifty-two cities will reduce by 407 MMTCO(2)e (million metric tons), compared with their base period (ranging from 1990 to 2013) emissions, which is equivalent to making the entire state of California, the sixth largest world economy, nearly carbon neutral. Case studies reveal that between 2000 and 2014, California and Sweden grew their Gross Domestic Products (GDPs) by nearly 30% while their CO(2)e emissions declined by 5% and 24% respectively. Such reductions employ a multitude of action plans, which we place in the context of the Ten Solutions for Carbon Neutrality and Climate Stability published by the University of California. The technologies deployed by the living laboratories include: improving end-use efficiencies; conversion to renewably generated electricity; solving intermittency of solar and wind power with batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen; developing micro-grids for distributed power generation; expanding use of electric vehicles; recycling reform; capturing agricultural/landfill emissions for conversion to gas; and food waste reduction. The living laboratories have demonstrated that scalable technologies are available now to drastically reduce world-wide carbon emissions. However, doing so requires fundamental behavioral changes.

AB  - 1. Stump extraction for bio energy is a new forestry activity and before large-scale implementation occurs, it is important to analyse its consequences. Saproxylic beetles depend on dead trees and stump extraction will reduce the amount of habitat available for this group.
   2. Early warning signs of impending regional species extinctions were looked for in areas where stump harvest has only been conducted for about 3years. In a paired design (N=8), the beetle fauna was sampled in stumps on ordinary clear-cuts and on clear-cuts from which stumps had been extracted. Sampling in extraction clear-cuts was possible because 25% of the stump volume was retained. Samples were collected by bark sieving ten Norway spruce, Picea abies, stumps per clear-cut.
   3. In total, 6959 individuals of 46 species were found. Several early warning signs were seen: stump extraction reduced the number of species per stump and per clear-cut and reduced the species evenness in individual stumps.
   4. Species at higher trophic levels (predators and fungivores), in particular, suffered negative effects. Stump extraction reduced the number of species of fungivores and facultative predators/fungivores at the clear-cut level and reduced the relative abundance of predators at the stump level.
   5. These results indicate that if stumps are extracted from a high proportion of the clear-cuts in a region, the present recommendations of leaving 15-25% of the stump volume will be insufficient for preserving the beetle fauna in the stumps. Further studies are needed to identify levels of stump retention that do not lead to species loss.

AB  - As an Arctic gateway, the Norwegian Sea sustains a rich diversity of seasonal and resident species of soniferous animals, vulnerable to the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities. We show the occurrence of seasonal patterns of acoustic signals in a small canyon off Northern Norway, and investigate cetacean vocal behavior, human-made noise, and climatic contributions to underwater sound between January and May 2018. Mostly median sound levels ranged between 68.3 and 96.31 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 across 1/3 octave bands (13 Hz-16 kHz), with peaks in February and March. Frequencies under 2 kHz were dominated by sounds from baleen whales with highest rates of occurrence during winter and early spring. During late-spring non-biological sounds were predominant at higher frequencies that were linked mainly to ship traffic. Seismic pulses were also recorded during spring. We observed a significant effect of wind speed and ship sailing time on received sound levels across multiple distance ranges. Our results provide a new assessment of high-latitude continental soundscapes in the East Atlantic Ocean, useful for management strategies in areas where anthropogenic pressure is increasing. Based on the current status of the local soundscape, we propose considerations for acoustic monitoring to be included in future management plans.

AB  - Significant transformation of agriculture took place in Central Europe during the second half of the 20(th) century. The paper reviews the nature and consequences of this process in terms of grassland management and land use changes in the Liptov region (N Slovakia) and their impacts on plant communities of fen meadows (Caricion davallianae, Caricion fuscae), wet Meadows (Calthion) and mesophilous grasslands (Arrhenatherion. Cynosurion). We studied in detail the changes in structure of the rare plant community Trollio-Cirsietum (Kuhn 1937) Oberd. 1957 that occurred between the first period ( 1974-1983) and the second period (2002-2003). We recorded the decrease in abundance of species characteristic for permanently wet and fen meadows (alliances Calthion and Caricion davallionae) and the increase in abundance of characteristic species of seasonally dried, mesophilous and thermophilous meadows and mesophilous fringes (classes Festuco-Brametea and alliances Molinion caeruleae, Bromion erecti and Trifolion medii). In the second Studied period, a large group of mesophilous and thermophilous Species appeared as new in this wet-meadow community. A Cumulative impact of different factors. especially drainage and intensification of surrounding grasslands as well as abandonment of the community can represent reasons responsible for observed changes. Regardless identified changes, the community still maintains its typical character in significant proportion of the studied sites and hosts a high number of threatened plant species.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are a promising and innovative approach to address multiple sustainability challenges faced by cities. Yet, NBS are not integrated into mainstream urban development practices. Based on a qualitative comparative case study of Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, this study shows how barriers to mainstreaming urban NBS are shaped by the structural conditions in urban infrastructure regimes, which offers an improved, context-sensitive understanding of why such barriers persist. We identify underlying structural conditions shaping seven key barriers to urban NBS: limited collaborative governance, knowledge, data and awareness challenges, low private sector engagement, competition over urban space, insufficient policy development, implementation and enforcement, insufficient public resources, and challenging citizen engagement. This study also advances an understanding of urban infrastructure regimes as complex, heterogeneous systems, made up of different functional domains that define the space available for sustainability innovations. Importantly, our case comparison reveals that similar barriers to NBS mainstreaming in planning processes are caused by different structural conditions across countries. For example, perceived causes of limited citizen engagement are low environmental awareness in Spain, a lack of resources to support participation in Hungary, and NIMBY-ism in the Netherlands. Our findings stress the importance of moving beyond 'silver bullet'-type approaches to addressing NBS mainstreaming barriers, towards systemic but contextsensitive responses, tailored to specific urban infrastructure regimes. This systematic understanding of barriers and their underlying structural conditions can help both scholars and practitioners identify promising pathways for the mainstreaming of NBS as an urban sustainability innovation.

AB  - Roads affect wildlife in many direct and indirect ways. For ungulates, roads may inhibit seasonal migration and may cause an effective loss of habitat due to avoidance. On the other hand, roadsides and associated agricultural lands offer high quality forage that may attract ungulates and increase the frequency of car accidents. Mitigating actions require detailed knowledge on space use in relation to roads. Using data from 67 global positioning system (GPS)-marked red deer in Norway, we quantified 1) scale of avoidance of roads, 2) crossing frequency, and 3) selection of crossing sites. Red deer avoided roads only on a very local scale and only during daytime, with minor influence of variation in road size (traffic burden). Marked red deer crossed roads, on average, 2 times per day. Females crossed more frequently than males and crossings were most frequent during autumn and winter and during night. Deer selected forested crossing sites close to agricultural pastures, reflecting that roads are crossed most often on nightly feeding excursions. Our findings imply that red deer in our study area have adjusted to exploit feeding habitat close to roads at times of low traffic burden. The high frequency of crossings suggests a limited influence on seasonal migration patterns. The frequency at which red deer cross highways suggests that mitigation measures to reduce road mortality may be effective if targeted in the right areas. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The Nordic Bioeconomy Pathways (NBPs), conceptualized subsets of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways varying from environmentally friendly to open-market competition scenarios, can lead to plausible stressors in future for using bioresources. This study analysed the impacts of NBPs on hydrology and water quality based on two different land system management attributes: management strategy and a combination of reduced stand management and biomass removal at a catchment-scale projection. To understand the potential impacts of NBPs, the Simojoki catchment in northern Finland was chosen, as the catchment mainly covered peatland forestry. The analysis integrated a stakeholder-driven questionnaire, the Finnish Forest dynamics model, and Soil and Water Assessment Tool to build NBP scenarios, including Greenhouse gas emission pathways, for multiple management attributes to simulate flows, nutrients, and suspended solids (SS). For the catchment management strategy, an annual decrease in nutrients was observed for sustainability and business-as-usual scenarios. Reduced stand management and biomass removal also led to decreased export of nutrients and SS for the same scenarios, whereas, in other NBPs, the export of nutrients and SS increased with decreased evapotranspiration. Although the study was investigated at a local scale, based on the current political and socioeconomic situation, the approach used in this study can be outscaled to assess the use of forest and other bioresources in similar catchments.

AB  - This study compares diversity and abundance of birds plus abundance of butterflies, bumblebees and herbaceous plants between six small farms (< 52 ha arable land) and six large farms (> 135 ha arable land) in Roslagen in southeastern Sweden. Two of the large and four of the small farms were organic. Large-scale landscape mosaic and underlying bedrock were similar for all farms. Statistical analysis was performed using box-plots on medians and analysis of variance on mean values. More than twice as many bird species and territories, butterflies, and herbaceous plant species, and five times more bumblebees were found on the small compared to the large farms. The largest differences were found between small organic and large conventional farms. Differences were also noted between small and large organic farms: 56% more bird species were found on small organic than on large organic farms, although none of the farms used any pesticides. We therefore argue that the consideration of organic agriculture's effect on biodiversity should include factors affected by farm size.

AB  - Energy usage in cities is intertwined with its spatial configuration-the denser and more compact the city, the more concentrated and efficient the energy usage is to be expected. To achieve sustainable communities, cities (and their inhabitants) must reconsider its spatial configurations in the context of rapid urbanisation and growth in light of limited resources and conflicting spatial claims. This article seeks to understand how spatial configurations affect transport energy usage in cities and propose an integrated assessment approach factoring spatial configurational analysis in relation to transport energy usage at the micro- and macroscale. Comparing Bergen, Norway, and Zurich, Switzerland, findings showed that spatial configurations were positively correlated to transport energy usage. Street structures suitable for walking and less suitable for car traffic tended to exhibit lower amounts of energy usage. Following this, nine typologies of transport and land use patterns are described to support planning for more sustainable means of transport.

AB  - From a policy perspective, it is important to understand forestry effects on surface waters from a landscape perspective. The EU Water Framework Directive demands remedial actions if not achieving good ecological status. In Sweden, 44 % of the surface water bodies have moderate ecological status or worse. Many of these drain catchments with a mosaic of managed forests. It is important for the forestry sector and water authorities to be able to identify where, in the forested landscape, special precautions are necessary. The aim of this study was to quantify the relations between forestry parameters and headwater stream concentrations of nutrients, organic matter and acid-base chemistry. The results are put into the context of regional climate, sulphur and nitrogen deposition, as well as marine influences. Water chemistry was measured in 179 randomly selected headwater streams from two regions in southwest and central Sweden, corresponding to 10 % of the Swedish land area. Forest status was determined from satellite images and Swedish National Forest Inventory data using the probabilistic classifier method, which was used to model stream water chemistry with Bayesian model averaging. The results indicate that concentrations of e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter are related to factors associated with forest production but that it is not forestry per se that causes the excess losses. Instead, factors simultaneously affecting forest production and stream water chemistry, such as climate, extensive soil pools and nitrogen deposition, are the most likely candidates The relationships with clear-felled and wetland areas are likely to be direct effects.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the relationship between sustainability and resilience concepts in agriculture. First, we discuss the theoretical preliminaries related to the definition of these two concepts. Indeed, the literature considers sustainability as a proxy for resilience and vice versa in the context of agriculture. Intuitively, one may expect that sustainability and resilience are positively correlated. Second, we challenge these insights by embarking on empirical analysis directed at the Northern European countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden) that are member states of the European Union. The criteria describing sustainability and economic resilience are identified for the empirical analysis. Third, the criteria decision making is applied to derive the composite indicators. The contemporaneous correlation between the composite indicators of sustainability and economic resilience is rather weak across the analyzed countries. However, the correlation increases in case the first-order differences of the composite indicators are considered. Therefore, economic resilience indicators cannot be replaced by sustainability-related ones and economic resilience should be taken as an additional facet of the economic sustainability when developing composite indicators.

AB  - Ecosystems are subject to multiple, natural and anthropogenic environmental influences, including nitrogen (N) deposition, land use and climate. Assessment of the relative importance of these influences on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is crucial for guiding policy and management decisions to mitigate global change; yet, few studies consider multiple drivers. In the UK, ongoing loss of the internationally important arctic/alpine moss-sedge community, Racomitrium heath, has been linked to elevated N deposition, high grazing pressures and their combination; however, the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear. We used environmental gradients across the habitat's European distribution (UK, Faroes, Norway and Iceland) to investigate the relative impact of N deposition and grazing pressure, as well as climate, on the condition of the dominant moss species, Racomitrium lanuginosum. Key variables including tissue chemistry, growth and cover were measured at 36 sites, and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the relative importance of the drivers across sites. Our results clearly show that regional variation in the condition of R. lanuginosum across Europe is primarily associated with the impacts of N deposition, with climate (air temperature) and grazing pressure playing secondary roles. In contrast to previous experimental studies, we found moss growth to be stimulated by elevated N deposition; this apparent discrepancy may result from the use of artificially high N concentrations in many experiments. Despite increased growth rates, we found that moss mat depth and cover declined in response to N deposition. Our results suggest that this is due to increased decomposition of material in the moss mat, which ultimately leads to loss of moss cover and habitat degradation. This study clearly demonstrates both the key role of N deposition in degradation of Racomitrium heath and the importance of observational studies along natural gradients for testing predictions from experimental studies in the real world.

AB  - Novel faunistic data are presented from the poorly explored area of northern Lapland and comparisons are made between the present day ostracod diversity and historical records from a century ago. Twenty sites were sampled across Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish Lapland: eight to the west of the Scandinavian Mountain range, where the climate is milder under the influence of the Gulfstream, and 12 sites in the slope area east of these mountains, where the impact of the continental climate is stronger The sample sites were mainly peat bogs fed by springs (the dominant habitat type in the study area), but also included helocrene springs, ditches, ponds and the littoral zone of lakes.
   In total 4376 individuals belonging to 16 species were collected. The most widespread and abundant species were Cyclocypris ovum, Candona candida and Pseudocandona rostrata, whereas Cyclocypris serena, Cryptocandona vavrai and Eucypris pigra were least abundant. The diversity of the ostracod assemblages to the west and to the east of the Scandinavian Mountains was significantly different, as measured by the Shannon diversity index. Mean values were 0.36 (western slopes) and 0.84 (eastern slopes).
   Three assemblage types were distinguished using UPGMA cluster analysis, with C. ovum, C. candida and P. rostrata as the three characteristic species. However, no statistically significant differences were revealed between the ostracod site assemblages when grouped geographically into west and east of the Scandinavian Mountains. Our results did not show any significant correlation between the Bray-Curtis similarity of the ostracod assemblages and the geographical separation between sites.
   The most marked difference in ostracod diversity between the present data and the records from the beginning of the 20th century seems to be a retreat of some Arctic species from the Lapland area and a shift of a few eurytopic species further to the north of Lapland. Possible factors influencing this shift are discussed.

AB  - The cultural roots and images of the Finnish wilderness lie in its use as a source of livelihood practiced in southern and central Finland during the Middle Ages. There are statutory wilderness areas in Finland, but Finnish people consider many other areas as wilderness. It is important for management of the areas, statutory wilderness areas and the other wilderness-like areas to determine what are the features that make an area wilderness, how these areas are used and appreciated by Finnish people. Questionnaires and landscape rankings were used to determine that. Old virgin forests and open bogs are the most important features of Finnish wilderness as revealed by the mental images of Finnish people. In addition, wilderness areas have to be vast, roadless, remote, peaceful, silent and at least near their natural condition. Ponds, streams, wooden trails across bogs and old cabins for common use are consistent with the idea of Finnish wilderness. Finnish people appreciate and use our wilderness areas mostly for picking berries or mushrooms, hunting, fishing and hiking. The experience of peace and silence is the most important motive to visit wilderness.

AB  - Cultural impacts in planning increasingly receive attention from both academics and practitioners around Europe. However, comparative planning cultures studies face the challenges of lacking systematic comparison and empirical evidence, especially at the micro level of planning actors' behaviour in interaction. This article aims to fill these gaps by (1) operationalizing the concept of planning culture; and (2) measuring and comparing it. We base our operationalization on the culturized planning model (Knieling, J., & Othengrafen, F. (Eds.). (2009). Planning cultures in Europe: Decoding cultural phenomena in urban and regional planning. Farnham: Ashgate). We complement its explanatory power by building a link between planning culture and planning outcome through attitudes of planning actors. This article focuses on three attitudes: risk, trust and co-operation. To measure and compare these attitudes, we adopt three experimental economic games and conduct an experiment with public and private planning practitioners in three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. Both cross-country and public-private differences in these attitudes are tested in the experiment. Our experimental findings suggest that Dutch planning actors value risk aversion and trust; Norwegian planning actors value cooperation; while (French-speaking) Belgian planning actors do not value these variables that much.

AB  - Sewer networks represent high value in water infrastructure assets and it is important to develop and operate them by specified sustainable management. This paper presents the results of a sustainability analysis on the wastewater transport system of Trondheim, Norway, for future planning (2014-2040) from a metabolism-based performance analysis by the Dynamic Metabolism Model (DMM). The aim of this work is to demonstrate a methodology for comparing different pathways toward a sustainable management of wastewater systems. For this purpose, four intervention strategies infiltration and inflow reduction', increasing rehabilitation rate', extension of system regarding population growth', energy management' along with different combinations of them have been analysed. The results of this study may give some support to decision-makers in wastewater departments. In practice, to achieve strategic level planning of sustainable sewer asset management, it is vital to assess different aspects of sustainability and manage them in a comprehensive system.

TI  - Towards sustainable development for the Murmansk region
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - The Murmansk region is situated in northwest Russia and is bordered by the Barents Sea. Most of the region (an area of 145 000 sq km) lies beyond the Arctic circle. Historically, the region has been of great importance politically and economically to the Russian Federation, providing the country with its only all-weather northern port and serving as the home to the Northern fleet of the Russian Navy, and the Murmansk Shipping Company (the main shipping agent for commercial cargo along the Russian Northern Sea Route). The main economic activities of the Murmansk region are mining and metallurgy, fishing, shipping and forestry. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential for oil and gas development in the Barents Sea which provides economic opportunities as well as environmental challenges for the Murmansk region.
   Despite the rich mineral resources and bioresources of this coastal region, Murmansk is suffering economically and is also facing severe environmental problems. It is officially recognized as the most environmentally devastated region of the Arctic. Key problems include air pollution, nuclear and other hazardous wastes, and resource depletion. Industries of the region are in need of investment for development and modernization.
   In order to protect the region's natural resource base and fragile ecosystem, and improve socio-economic conditions, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-Capacity 21, in cooperation with the government of the Russian Federation, initiated the Murmansk Region-Barents Seu Sustainable Development Project. This project aims to strengthen the capacity of institutions in the region to effectively plan and implement environmentally sustainable economic development policies and programs.
   Phase 1 of the UNDP project resulted in development of a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) for the region which presents action strategies and specific recommendations to strengthen the economy and environment of the Murmansk region. In preparation of the SDAP and other project activities, multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral Task Force teams addressed a broad range of topics including coastal zone management (CZM), radioactive waste handling, mining and metallurgy, energy, and public health.
   This article provides a brief overview of the Murmansk Region-Barents Sea Sustainable Development Project. It then focuses on the CZM component, discussing priority environment and economic development issues for ocean and coastal areas and looking at Integrated Coastal Zone Management as a framework for addressing some of the region's needs. Specific recommendations for sustainable development of ocean and coastal areas are proposed (for fisheries, oil and gas development, shipping, waste management, etc.). The article concludes by summarizing the overall project achievements and highlighting priority programs identified by regional specialists as well as some factors influencing regional progress towards sustainable development.
   The Murmansk Region State Committee on Environmental Protection served as the National Executing Agency for the UNDP project. Project management and technical services were provided, under contract with UNDP, by Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), an international NGO whose work focuses on human and organizational capacity building for sustainable development. Over 150 local and international experts collaborated on the project. Key institutions contributing to the coastal zone management component of the project were: Murmansk Marine Biological Institute (Kola Science Center); Murmansk State Committee on Environmental Protection (Marine Inspection); Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries (PINRO); Urban Harbors Institute, University of Massachusetts, Boston; Fritjof Nansen Institute, Norway, and the Coastal Zone Management Centre of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management, The Netherlands.

AB  - The ongoing biodiversity crisis is characterised not only by an elevated extinction rate but also can lead to an increasing similarity of species assemblages. This is an issue of major concern, as it can reduce ecosystem resilience and functionality. Changes in the composition of pollinator communities have mainly been described in intensive agricultural lowland areas. In this context, using a replicated survey of historical and recent bumblebee diversity, we aimed here to test how documented changes in climate and land use influenced the potential homogenization of sub-alpine bumblebee communities in southern Norway. We assessed the change in community composition in terms of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional (beta-)diversity, and estimated the impact of various species traits in probabilities of species gains and losses. Overall, we found a strong reduction in functional diversity, but no change in phylogenetic diversity over time. The beta-diversity decreased, especially at high elevations, and this pattern was consistent for taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional beta-diversity. The spatial distribution, measured as the average site occupancy, decreased in habitat-specialist species. This was explained by both a higher risk of species loss and a lower probability of species gain for habitat-specialist and parasitic species than for generalist and social species. These findings demonstrate that a narrow niche breadth may contribute to a higher extinction risk in bumblebee species. This non-random impact of disturbance on species may lead to large-scale biotic homogenisation of communities, a pattern that can be detected by investigating biodiversity changes at different scales and across its multiple facets.

AB  - This paper aims to deepen the insights into specific policy and planning prerequisites that affect how bicycle logistics services can be initiated and established in urban environments. Empirical data consist of policy documents and qualitative interviews with bicycle logistics entrepreneurs and local policy actors from four Swedish municipalities which are all known for their ambitious strategies for sustainable transport. The paper leads to insights into a variety of challenges facing the introduction of bicycle logistics in urban environments but points also to possibilities and key issues for the further development of these types of concepts. Among these are the importance of targeted initiatives and support for new concepts for sustainable urban freight, but also conscious strategies for infrastructure development and a more well-informed use of public procurement processes. In addition, the study confirms the importance of norms, attitudes and knowledge among policy makers, planners and potential customers about bicycle logistics and its potential for urban areas.

AB  - Coastal states around the world are currently adopting an integrated and ecosystem-based approach to the management of coastal and ocean areas. The main aim is to promote resource use while protecting the integrity of the marine ecosystems. Focus is therefore on the conflict between economic development and conservation. Less attention is paid to the complex uses of the ocean and the conditions for regulating industrial activities and solving multi-use conflicts. This paper discusses principles for dealing with use conflicts in the context of ecosystem-based management. It argues that resolving use conflicts is not only an important issue in its own right, but can also be important for the marine environment and biodiversity. As an illustration, we look at the relationship between the fishing industry and the offshore oil and gas industry in Norway and Vietnam. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The introduction and development of cultivation in eastern Finland was studied by pollen and charcoal analysis of a palaeomagnetically dated sediment profile from Lake Orijarvi, in the vicinity of permanent prehistoric fields. The earliest changes of possibly anthropogenic origin are visible in the pollen data from 1630 B. C. onwards and indications of human impact become more evident from 500 B. C. onwards. According to finds of cereal pollen and AMS-dating of charred cereal grains from the oldest field layer, the onset of cultivation can be dated to the Merovingian period around A. D. 600. To a significant extent the pollen data reflect only the cultivation of Secale during the first 600 years. The marked intensification of agricultural activities including cultivation in permanent fields only becomes evident in the pollen data from about A. D. 1050 to 1080 onwards and the most intensive land use phase dates to A. D. 1300 - 1965. Archaeological and palaeoecological material indicate that swidden cultivation and permanent field cultivation were in use simultaneously during the late Iron Age. The combination of these techniques together with animal husbandry and hunting formed a subsistence strategy in the climatic border-zone outside the centres of the agricultural core areas.

AB  - Many people like city life in its variety, that is characteristic in its availability of cultural activities and social tolerance that manifests itself in coexistence of different life-styles. The city has to be lively and multifaceted both during the day and at night; therefore it is good that the center of the city is populated. The city must ensure opportunities for citizens' meetings; it has to be appropriate for everyday activities, festivities, culture events and any other functions.
   Historic urban environment is an interesting challenge for these functions in conjunction with the historic buildings ecosystems. The most important challenge for ensuring these functions are considerations dealing with microclimate of historic urban environment.
   The historic urban environment as an eco-system is a single whole, in which plants, animals, micro-organisms and people interact, creating a special microclimate. Climate control continued assurance is one of the major tasks and major challenges of urban planning professionals, particularly in the urban environment is creating new construction volumes with modern materials, which give rise to the old town ecosystem irreversible destruction, disrupting the natural microclimate. Historic buildings deteriorate, comfort requirements of inhabitants of these buildings are increasing, and therefore careful and neutral solutions for microclimate are needed for restoring and improving energy efficiency of these buildings.
   This research is needed to consider how to evaluate which materials and ways should be used for reconstruction and insulation of historic buildings, what are the main risk factors and criteria for the selection of suitable ecologic building materials to conserve historic urban ecosystem.
   Research Innovation: Evaluation of insulation materials in accordance with requirements of ecosystem conservation of historic center.
   Topicality of the Research Paper: Swedish experience shows that it is possible to reach acceptable solution for all parties.
   Research problem: The maintenance of historical urban ecosystem in Latvia is carried out with inadequate insulation materials. Latvian regulations do not determine what kind of insulation materials should be used to improve energy efficiency in historic buildings. There is a lack of information and education in the related field.
   Goal of the research: To develop recommendations for improving energy efficiency in culture historic buildings to preserve the ecosystem of historic urban environment.
   Research methods: Qualitative methods used in the research paper:
   1. Theoretical analyses of literature, analyses of relevant legislation and project materials
   2. Empirical research methods poll, comparative analyses of data.
   Results
   Interpretation of problems and development of solutions for improvement of energy efficiency in historic buildings considering aesthetic and heritage value of the buildings.
   Research innovation evaluation of insulation materials according to the conservation requirements of ecosystem of historic urban environment.
   Research results are useful for improvement of energy efficiency of historic buildings preserving the historic ecosystem of the urban environment.

AB  - Unlearning is drawing attention in sustainability research. Unlearning old beliefs and assumptions is needed to tackle wicked problems and to make space for learning. We introduce a framework for examining the potential of unlearning as a group process for transformational change. We integrate conceptual elements of unlearning with framing research and analyze 1) factors that facilitate unlearning, 2) the moments of doubt where unlearning and reframing takes place and 3) how unlearning can be operationalized in the analysis of discussion material. We demonstrate the framework by using a conflict situation the conservation of Siberian flying squirrels in the Tampere urban region in Finland as a case study where the participating actors had to unlearn dominant beliefs and assumptions to make space for a more strategic, comprehensive and proactive approach to collaborative conservation. A predictive habitat model of the regional flying squirrel population helped the process, but the decisive support for unlearning was a facilitated dialogue process with diverse assignments. The framework is tailored to experimental group processes by which innovative unlearning and reframing can be initiated and supported for organizational and interorganizational change.

AB  - Despite harsh climate, agriculture on the northern margins of Russia still remains the backbone of food security. Historically, in both regions studied in this article - the Republic of Karelia and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) - agricultural activities as dairy farming and even cropping were well adapted to local conditions including traditional activities such as horse breeding typical for Yakutia. Using three different sources of information - official statistics, expert interviews, and field observations - allowed us to draw a conclusion that there are both similarities and differences in agricultural development and land use of these two studied regions. The differences arise from agroclimate conditions, settlement history, specialization, and spatial pattern of economy. In both regions, farming is concentrated within the areas with most suitable natural conditions. Yet, even there, agricultural land use is shrinking, especially in Karelia. Both regions are prone to being affected by seasonality, but vary in the degree of its influence. Geographical location plays special role, and weaknesses caused by remoteness to some extent become advantage as in Yakutia. Proximity effect is controversial. In Karelia, impact of neighboring Finland is insignificant compared with the nearby second Russian city - Saint Petersburg.

AB  - Regional variation in spore deposition and viability was studied for two fungi, Fomitopsis rosea (Alb. & Schwein.: Fr.) P. Karst. and Phlebia centrifuga P. Karst., both confined to old-growth spruce forests in the boreal zone. Seven regions in Sweden were studied along a north-south transect in which the historical impact from forestry increases and the amount old forests decreases towards the south. The two southernmost regions were located outside the distribution border of the species. Spore deposition was measured species specifically as heterokaryotisation of homokaryotic mycelia growing on wood discs. There was a significant decline in spore deposition towards the south for both species. F. rosea deposited an average amount of 111 spores m(-2) 24 h(-1) in the northernmost region compared to less than 1 spore in the four southernmost regions. The corresponding values for P. centrifuga were 27 spores m(-2) 24 h(-1) in the north compared to less than 2 spores in the 4 southernmost regions. No deposition was found south of the distribution borders. The viability of spores from local populations within each region was measured as germination success on nutrient media. Individual fruiting bodies from large populations in the north generally produced spores with higher germinability than fruiting bodies from geographically isolated populations in the central and southern regions. However, there was a high variation among the southern populations. Our data suggest that some populations in mid- and south Sweden may suffer from negative genetic effects, possibly associated with fragmentation and loss of habitat. Thus, the combination of low spore deposition and low germinability of spores may be a threat to the long-term persistence of F. rosea and P. centrifuga in southern Sweden. Several other species may experience the same situation, especially when considering the severe decline of dead wood in Swedish forests.

AB  - Climate-proofing coastal cities is an important part of the current policy agenda for climate adaptation, particularly in a situation where waterfront redevelopment is accelerating. Cities call for innovative approaches integrating climate protection with urban attractiveness and waterfront endeavors. There is a lack of studies targeting policy processes for coastal protection, including the choice of adaptation strategies and impediments for implementation. Sweden is an interesting case due to the decentralized character of coastal adaptation. Consequently, this paper aims to analyze the status of and conditions for large-scale multifunctional coastal protection by means of qualitative analyses of policy documents and interviews with frontline practitioners in four Swedish coastal cities: Malmo center dot, Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Landskrona. The analysis documents a predominant focus on envisioning/planning for coastal protection rather than implementation of adaptation measures. While waterfront development functions as a window of opportunity in the more populous cities it also risks creating fragmentation and social imbalances in coastal protection between cities and their various coastal areas. Key implementation determinants emphasize formal institutional aspects, where politics and political decision-making need to set the necessary terms ensuring implementation. Current public-private and nationallocal distribution of responsibilities, stepwise planning and limited funding-mechanisms create uncertainties in system robustness and coherency. The consequences of a system for coastal protection heavily reliant on decentralized action needs to be properly considered by adaptation policy-makers.

AB  - In this paper, interpretations of sustainable forestry are investigated against the historical background of transformations in the industrial utilisation of forests. Three distinct forest policy regimes in Finland since the 19th century are identified. First, the introduction of the German forestry model, with the central notion of sustained yield, and the establishment of the Finnish Forest Service took place simultaneously in the latter half of the 19th century. These actions aimed at changing patterns of local forest use considered detrimental to long-term forest utilisation. Second, a national forest sector was established during the 20th century. Industrial forestry was seen as a guarantee of economic independence for the new nation-state. Third, during a recent phase the influence of non-governmental organisations and international forest industry companies has increased, and traditional power relations have changed as issues such as biodiversity, forest certification and global investments have been introduced to the debates. It is concluded that the recent transformations in forest management should be read as transformations in industrial forestry rather than as abandonment of industrial forest use models; the legacy of the 19th century German forest science still prevails in forest management.

AB  - Changes in environmental conditions within a river basin in South Central Sweden (1400 km(2)) and impacts on riverine nitrogen (N) transport were evaluated. A historical database was compiled and the process-based HBV-N model used to estimate flow normalised N loads in 1885, 1905, 1927, 1956, 1976, and 1994, using a standard climatological record (1985-1994). The study shows the value of process-based modelling in environmental impact assessment, by making it possible to assess and integrate the effect of a number of factors, both with regard to human impact and natural climatic variability. Factors taken into account include: the effects of land use, agricultural practices, atmospheric deposition, human dietary intake, use of flush toilets, lowering of lakes, building of dams, and climatic variability. For all years studied, agriculture was the overriding source of N, and changes in riverine N over time mainly reflected changes in land use and agricultural practices. In spite of decreasing N-leaching from agriculture, the net load remained fairly constant between 1885 and 1927, due to reduced N retention. Drainage of agricultural land had a dominating impact on reducing N retention, which increased the N loads, while the effects of the lowering of lake levels and dam building were less pronounced. Household N emission per capita was higher in 1994 than in 1927, as the increased consumption of meat and dairy products alone resulted in a higher increase of the emission than was compensated for with wastewater treatment improvement. In addition, introduction of flush toilets increased the emission from households. In total, the net load in 1976 was twofold higher than that in 1885, 1905 and 1927, due to increased leaching from agriculture, wastewater emission, and atmospheric deposition on lake surfaces. Finally, the impact of climatological variability was assessed, using a 110-yr climatological record. The choice of 10-yr period of climatological data was the factor that had the largest impact on calculated N load.

AB  - Knowing the ecological requirements of bird species is essential for their successful conservation. We studied the niche characteristics of birds in managed small-sized green spaces in the urban core areas of southern (Kavala, Greece) and northern Europe (Rovaniemi, Finland), during the breeding season, based on a set of 16 environmental variables and using Outlying Mean Index, a multivariate ordination technique. Overall, 26 bird species in Kavala and 15 in Rovaniemi were recorded in more than 5% of the green spaces and were used in detailed analyses. In both areas, bird species occupied different niches of varying marginality and breadth, indicating varying responses to urban environmental conditions. Birds showed high specialization in niche position, with 12 species in Kavala (46.2%) and six species in Rovaniemi (40.0%) having marginal niches. Niche breadth was narrower in Rovaniemi than in Kavala. Species in both communities were more strongly associated either with large green spaces located further away from the city center and having a high vegetation cover (urban adapters; e.g., Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), European Greenfinch (Chloris chloris), Eurasian Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus)) or with green spaces located closer to the city center and having high gray area cover and anthropogenic disturbance level (urban exploiters; e.g., Western Jackdaw (Corvus monedula), House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica)). The eleven species that were common to both study areas similarly used the environmental variables and had similar niches, indicating that birds respond similarly to urbanization irrespective of latitude. Sixteen species in Kavala and eleven species in Rovaniemi were identified as conservation priority species, based on their niche specialization level and conservation status. The management actions proposed for the conservation of priority species will also benefit other species with similar ecological requirements and ultimately help maintain diverse bird communities in small-sized green spaces in urban core areas.

AB  - This paper summarises discussions in a workshop entitled "exploring uncertainties in biodiversity science, policy and management". It draws together experiences gained by scientists and scholars when encountering and coping with different types of uncertainty in their work in the field of biodiversity protection. The discussion covers all main phases of scientific work: field work and data analysis; methodologies; setting goals for research projects, taking simultaneously into account the agency of scientists conducting the work; developing communication with policy-makers and society at large; and giving arguments for the societal relevance of the issues. The paper concludes with a plea for collaborative learning that would build upon close cooperation among specialists who have developed expertise in different fields in research, management and politics.

AB  - We examined a hybrid method, referred to here as the A'WOT [Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in SWOT analysis], for improving the usability of SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. A commonly used decision analysis method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and its eigenvalue calculation framework are integrated with SWOT analysis. The connection of AHP with SWOT yields analytically determined and quantifiable priorities for the factors included in SWOT analysis. The aim in applying the hybrid method is to improve the quantitative basis of strategic planning processes. After applying the A'WOT method, decision-makers have information at their disposal about how alternative strategies are congruent with internal and external environmental factors. In a decision-making process, this information can be utilized in concert with other produced decision-support elements. The A'WOT was used in connection with the strategic planning of natural resource management at the Finnish Forest and Park Service (FFPS). Four alternative strategies were produced during the planning process. The alternatives produced were Forestry Strategy (emphasis on sustainable economic use of forests); Recreation Strategy (emphasis on recreational use of forests and social and economic sustainability); Protection Strategy (emphasis on nature protection and ecological sustainability); and the Basic Strategy (current land allocation and forestry practice principles). Opportunities determined by the priorities of the scaling factors had the greatest weight in all the business units of the FFPS. The most important internal factors included both strengths (know-how, land, and water property) along with a couple of weaknesses (lack of information concerning biodiversity due to insufficient planning resources, age, and development class structures of forests).

AB  - Species checklists are powerful and important tools of communication between taxonomists and applied environmental biologists, which in turn lead to well-planned and successful conservation strategies and ecological studies. Despite this, only recently the interest on compiling systematic checklists is growing among taxonomists who study tardigrades - micrometazoans that inhabit almost every habitat worldwide. As the Finnish records of tardigrades (a.k.a. water bears) species are incomplete, outdated and no checklist has ever been compiled for this country, an easy-to-consult checklist is here reported. This checklist covers all Finnish tardigrade taxa identified in the past and in the 13 samples collected for this study. A total of 68 tardigrade species are recorded from Finland, with 6 of them being new records presented in this contribution. Of these species, four have their loci tipici in Finland and we provide an English translation of their original Gennan descriptions. A Generalised Linear Model was used to test the effect of sampling effort and area size on the number of species recorded in each biogeographical province of Finland. The results showed that geographical differences in species richness can be explained solely by sampling effort. The number of tardigrade species recorded in Finland corresponds to about 5% of all described species in the phylum, thus indicating a potential high richness for this country. However, the results of the Generalised Linear Model highlight that a reliable knowledge of the tardigrade diversity in Finland will be reached only with a more uniform and intensive sampling effort.

AB  - Hydropeaking, defined as rapid and frequent changes in flow to optimize hydropower production, is an increasingly common procedure negatively affecting lotic habitats in riverine ecosystems. An important aspect of hydropeaking is zero-flow events, occurring when hydropower stations are stopped due to low energy demand or low electricity prices. We quantified the ecological benefits and consequences for hydropower production of restricting zero-flow events. The 19 major hydropower stations in the Ume River system in northern Sweden stand still with no discharge 9% to 55% of the time a hydrologically normal year, transforming lotic habitat to stagnant water. The duration of zero-flow events is exacerbated in dry years, with no discharge for 28% of the time in a typical station, to be compared with 7% in a wet year. Zero-flow events affect the behavior of fish, altering the fish community, and potentially result in low oxygen levels and low food supply to filter-feeding macroinvertebrates. We modelled the consequences of restricting zero-flow events by introducing minimum flows equaling mean annual low flow or higher for the entire Ume River catchment. The measure would result in an additional 240 ha of shallow lotic habitat with gravel to boulder streambeds having flow velocity exceeding 0.1 m/s, i.e. suitable for lotic species such as grayling Thymallus thymallus. In addition, the measure would enable creating another 107 ha of similar habitat after structural rehabilitation of river reaches. All measures would result in a mean loss of hydropower production of 0.5% per year for the entire river system, 98% of which would occur between May and October when the demand for electricity is lower. Hydropower production would also be partly moved from daytime to nighttime. As zero-flow events are common in several other river systems, restrictions on their frequency and duration could be implemented in many areas.

AB  - Many trees sprout after cutting and other disturbances, and individuals may persist for a long time. In 25 forests in Sweden subjected to thinning for biodiversity values, we tested whether survival and growth of sprouts are related to stump diameter. Stem diameters vary under conservation thinning and earlier work had indicated high survival of stumps of small diameter. We also tested whether a continuum of responses in sprouting existed among the 14 species, as predicted by earlier work. We cut on average 26 % of the basal area (mean basal area 28 m(2)/ha) and analysed 1,044 stumps (diameters 10-76 cm). The response of the species after 9 years ranged along a continuum from weak to strong sprouting. Survival was highest for Corylus avellena (95 % of cut individuals survived) and Tilia cordata (85 %), then decreased as follows; Crataegus spp. > Alnus glutinosa > Prunus avium > Fraxinus excelsior > Quercus robur/Q. petraea > Salix caprea > Sorbus aucuparia > Acer platanoides > Betula pendula, to Betula pubescens (8 %) and Fagus sylvatica (8 %). Within species, stump survival was unrelated to stump diameter. Mean maximal sprout height of surviving stumps varied from about 1 to 4 m among the species after 9 years. Sprout height was unrelated to stump diameter. Stump survival (%) and mean sprout height were positively correlated across species. In conclusion, stem diameter had no effect on sprouting, but the 14 species could be clearly ranked in regrowth. Our results are useful in planning thinning of mixed forests for biodiversity conservation, for biomass harvest, or combined purposes.

AB  - 1. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a leading cause of species extinction. This not only concerns loss of major habitats, but also loss of microclimatic heterogeneity within such habitats.
   2. In this study, we examine the effects of microclimate on the abundance and movements of Onthophagus gibbulus, a dung beetle associated with pastoral habitats. While formerly widespread in Southern Finland, the species is now critically endangered at a national level, persisting within an area of 6 km(2).
   3. We divided the Finnish distribution of O. gibbulus into 50 x 50-m grid cells, characterised local microclimate by incident solar radiation, and surveyed the distribution of O. gibbulus within a subset of cells. To investigate the impact of microclimatic conditions on dung beetle movements, we conducted a mark-release-recapture study.
   4. Our approach allowed us to estimate the national population size of O. gibbulus- a figure rarely available for endangered insect species. The Finnish population of O. gibbulus comprises between 2000 and 6000 individuals.
   5. The abundance of beetles per dung pat increases with incident solar radiation, and beetles are more likely to move towards warmer than colder spots in the landscape.
   6. Overall, our study depicts O. gibbulus as a thermophile confined to the warmest part of the landscape, and offers loss of microclimatic variation as the cause for its large-scale decline. To conserve O. gibbulus and similar species, we need to consider not only the amount of macrohabitats, but also the amount and distribution of microclimatic variation within them. Future predictions are complicated by ongoing climate change.

AB  - The urban expansion currently under development around the two materials science facilities MAX IV and European Spallation Source in Lund, Sweden, surrounds two meticulously designed research facilities steered by global demands. The new urban area, together with the research facilities dedicated to science and the development of knowledge, expands the city of Lund onto high-quality agricultural land. In doing so, the municipal planning is attempting to align contemporary ideas of sustainable urban development with large-scale scientific infrastructure. This actualizes an ethical dilemma as the urban expansion onto productive agricultural land overrides previous decisions taken by the municipality regarding land use. It can also be understood as going against national land use policy which states that development on productive agricultural land should be avoided. As the planning stands today, the research facilities heavily push local urban development into the area while the intended research outcomes primarily relate to a global research community tied to international scientific demands for materials science. Although the Brunnshog area is realized through a neutralizing planning strategy, thought to balance and compensate for the development on farmland, the effects of the counterbalancing acts are primarily played out at a local urban level in terms of diverse, exciting, and locally sustainable neighbourhoods. The land use protection policies meant to secure national food production rather operates on a national scale. The argument made in this text is that sustainable development, and the intended balancing acts it involves, ought to be carefully considered in terms of scalar effects. Sustainable planning effects' scalar extent should be taken into account through careful assessment of the step between good intentions and expected outcomes.

AB  - A protected area network should ensure the maintenance of biodiversity. Because of climate change, species ranges are expected to move polewards, causing further demand for the protected area network to be efficient in preserving biota. We compared population changes of different bird species groups according to their habitat preferences in boreal protected areas in Finland on the basis of large-scale censuses carried out in 1981-1999 and in 2000-2009. Population densities of common forest habitat generalists remained the same between the two periods, while densities of species of conservation concern showed contrasting trends: species preferring old-growth forests increased, but those living on mires and wetlands, and species of Arctic mountains decreased. These trends are most probably connected with climate change, but successional changes in protected areas and regional habitat alteration should also be taken into account. Of species preferring old-growth forests, a larger proportion are southern than among species of mires and wetlands, or of Arctic mountains, most or all of which, respectively, had a northerly distribution. In general, northern species have decreased and southern increased with the exception of northern species of old-growth forests which had not declined. On the other hand, bird species of mires and wetlands decreased also in the northernmost protected areas although mires had not been drained in the region in contrast with southern and central Finland thus indicating that regional-scale direct habitat loss did not cause the decline of these species in the north. It is suggested that climate change effects on species in natural boreal and Arctic habitats most probably are habitat-specific with large differences in response times and susceptibility.

AB  - We assessed the habitat patch occupancy of a deciduous-mixed forest specialist, the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus), in a 1000 km(2) conifer dominated landscape in relation to two landscape parameters, namely proportion and isolation of suitable habitat. Data from five consecutive spring seasons were used and within habitat variation controlled for. The occurrence of long-tailed tits was positively related to the amount of habitat within 1 km(2) (p=0.0007) and negatively related to the distance between habitat patches (p < 0.0001). When combined, the two variables explained > 78% of the variation in local patch occupancy. There were distinct thresholds in these landscape variables for the probability of local long-tailed tit presence. In the model the probability increased from 0.1 to 0.8 when interpatch distance decreased from 500 to 100 m with 5% total habitat coverage. With a total proportion of 15% suitable habitat, the same probability jump occurred when interpatch distance changed from 900 to 500 m. The general importance of defined measurements and quantified threshold levels for species conservation and landscape management is discussed.

AB  - The legacy of the Norwegian landscape architect Knut Ove Hillestad (1963-1991) The Norwegian landscape architect Knut Ove Hillestad was employed at the Norwegian Watershed and Energy Directorate INVE) in the years 1963 until 1991, when he reshaped watershed landscapes affected by large-scale hydropower developments The taproot of this work was his concept of leaving living nature, by which he meant that nature ought to be regenerated and left diverse and self-reproductive The concept may be regarded as a third way of protecting nature, between the classical regimes of preservative growth and "ecological ideologies" The intellectual roots of living nature may be found in two distinct phases of Hiflestad's carrier In the 1960s, NVE's nature management was inspired by the Swedish organisation Samfundet for Hembygdsvard This organisation was primarily oriented toward cultural and aesthetic issues, it was friendly towards industrial growth, and the landscape architects were its most influential expertise In this period, Hillestad was a dedicated representative of his profession In the 1970s, he became more a manager to a network dominated by natural scientists, mostly biologists This was a growing profession with significant objections to manipulating nature These groups, however, lay new premises to Hillestad's activity, but also acquired the landscape architect's perception of landscape care as an act not of conserving, but of creation

AB  - In both Finland and The Netherlands strategies are being developed to switch from fossil to green resources in order to tackle the challenges of climate change and resource dependencies and to tap into the economic opportunities that arise. We investigated the similarities and differences in the transition process and governance strategies with respect to the transition towards a bioeconomy in both countries, using transition management as an evaluative lens. The research method involved comparative qualitative case study analysis through action research. We found that the governance approach in The Netherlands focusses on co-creating a long-term vision that informs for short-term action, on facilitating bottom-up regional clusters and promoting radical innovation through cooperation between vested players and frontrunners. Finland adopts a more traditional, top-down governance strategy, focussing on the shorter-term economic opportunities and incremental innovation that keep the overall structure of existing industries intact. We conclude that the Dutch government acts as a facilitator, while the Finnish government acts more as a director of the transition. We recommend that Finland's governance for the bioeconomy be improved by applying insights from transition management, while the Dutch approach runs the risk of being captured by vested interests.

AB  - While progress has been made in reducing external nutrient inputs to the Baltic Sea, further actions are needed to meet the goals of the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), especially for the Baltic Proper, Gulf of Finland, and Gulf of Riga sub-basins. We used the net anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus inputs (NANI and NAPI, respectively) nutrient accounting approach to construct three scenarios of reduced NANI-NAPI. Reductions assumed that manure nutrients were redistributed from areas with intense animal production to areas that focus on crop production and would otherwise import synthetic and mineral fertilizers. We also used the Simple as Necessary Baltic Long Term Large Scale (SANBALTS) model to compare eutrophication conditions for the scenarios to current and BSAP-target conditions. The scenarios suggest that reducing NANI-NAPI by redistributing manure nutrients, together with improving agronomic practices, could meet 54-82% of the N reductions targets (28-43 kt N reduction) and 38-64% P reduction targets (4-6.6 kt P reduction), depending on scenario. SANBALTS output showed that even partial fulfillment of nutrient reduction targets could have ameliorating effects on eutrophication conditions. Meeting BSAP targets will require addressing additional sources, such as sewage. A common approach to apportioning sources to external nutrients loads could enable further assessment of the feasibility of eutrophication management targets.

AB  - International and national policies stress the importance of spatial planning for the long-term sustainability of regions. This paper identifies the extent to which the spatial planning in a Swedish region can be characterised as a collaborative learning process. By combining qualitative interviews and systems thinking methods we analysed the main attributes of public-led spatial (i.e. comprehensive) planning in nine municipalities representing a steep urban-rural gradient in the Bergslagen region of Central Sweden. We show that the attributes of strategic spatial planning needed for collaborative learning were absent or undeveloped. All studied municipalities experienced challenges in coordinating complex issues regarding long-term planning to steer territorial development and help to solve conflicts among competing interests. Stakeholder participation was identified as a basic condition for social learning in planning. Together with stakeholders we identified the causal structure behind stakeholder participation in municipal planning processes, including main drivers and feedback loops. We conclude that there is a need for arenas allowing and promoting stakeholder activity, participation and inclusion that combines both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and where evidence-based collaborative learning can occur.

AB  - Aim of study: Participation of stakeholders is considered an essential element in producing, at different spatial and temporal scales, forest plans accepted by local community and fulfilling the requirements of Sustainable Forest Management. Increasingly, computer-based decision support systems (DSS) and tools are being introduced to assist stakeholders and decision-makers in coping with the complexities inherent in participatory forest planning. The study aimed to investigate how useful the users and researchers see DSS tools and which opportunities they perceive DSS might carry for enhancing participatory forest planning in their field of activity.
   Area of study: 15 Italian and Finnish researchers and practitioners were interviewed.
   Material and methods: Face-to-face structured interviews were used to collect opinions and experiences. Quantitative and qualitative information were analyzed to investigate differences between Italian and Finnish respondents as well as between researchers and practitioners
   Main results: Results showed that in Italy there has been more focus on forest-level and medium-term problems and the intelligence phase, while in Finland there has been more attention to region-level and long-term problems and equally intelligence, design, and choice phases of decision-making. Deviations probably reflect different planning contexts and culture, variability in experiences and expertise in DSS and in availability of suitable DSS.
   Research highlights: The study suggests to pay attention to evaluating the success criteria of participatory planning when preparing for the use of DSS and related tools in practical forest planning processes. Experience sharing is a key to reaching more successful use of DSS.

Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) projects can be considered as pioneers in value integration. By combining bureaucratic innovations (BI) and social innovations (SI) these BGI projects are able to reach a more holistic development that is characterised as a value-driven approach for sustainability transitions. In this study on BGI projects, we aim to learn how to deliver multi-functional projects through different interpretation of four factors, i.e. professional culture, governance level, geographical space, and time conception, in various constellations of BI and SI. Results of our cross-case study of four BGI projects in three European countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden) indicate that project with higher degrees of value integration balance BI and SI in following four ways: (i) heterogeneity in professions in value-decision-making, (ii) multi-level governance embedded in institutional frameworks, (iii) connecting city-wide and neighbourhood levels by boundary spanners, and (iv) having a dynamic time conception. Our findings imply that social innovation experiences on projects has to fit into the bureaucratic environment to achieve true value integration.

AB  - In this paper we use a case of resistance towards a proposed limestone quarry in Sweden to raise certain theoretical points regarding environmental politicization. Departing from ideas about depoliticization and neoliberal environmental governance, we first analyze the case in terms of scaling-up of the local conflict through actor alliances, discourse coalitions and through the juridical process. We then discuss how this case may indicate effective ways to politicize areas that have been depoliticized through neoliberal environmental governance. Most particularly, the chosen case highlights how depoliticization may be reversed through the politicization of the very channels through which depoliticized forms of environmental governance occur, here the juridical, formalized and nominally neutral processes of environmental planning.

AB  - In recent years, land use data from the EU's Integrat-ed Administration and Control System (IACS) have become increasingly available for research purposes. IACS data contain annual plot-level information on cultivation and location of the land farmed by agricultural beneficiaries, covering the majority of farmland in the EU. The data thus provide infor-mation on land use that is spatially and temporally highly disaggregated. Researchers from a broad range of disciplines already rely on IACS data for various applications and EU member states must make an anonymised, geospatially-referenced version of the data publicly available in the future. However, there is no complete and structured overview of the data's use, their benefits and limitations that future research could rely on. This calls for conducting a systematic review of the applications of IACS plot -level data in scientific literature. Preparing the ground for such a review, this paper presents a review protocol for identifying and analysing publications using plot-level IACS data from Austria, Czechia, France, Germany, and Sweden in a systematic map. To test and refine the protocol and to illustrate the planned review, we conduct a pilot analysis of 12 selected academic publications and present the results. The pilot analysis demonstrates that the re-view protocol is adequate and that novel insights will be gained by mapping out the already existing work that uses IACS data.

AB  - The debate about whether proactive (focused on irreplaceable species) or reactive (focused on vulnerable species) conservation is more effective usually focuses on the global or multinational scale and knowledge of how these principles interact on-the-ground is lacking. Here we use the first long-term dataset on an entire oak-living beetle community in hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) to ask whether policy-driven conservation actions aimed at vulnerable species can also be proactive for unthreatened, but irreplaceable species. Hollow oaks are vital keystone structures that are rich in both vulnerable and irreplaceable wood-living beetles. We sampled in excess of 23,000 individuals from 307 species over four seasons, across the oak range in Norway. We assessed the importance of key environmental variables for vulnerable, irreplaceable and generalist species. We show that simple management actions taken to benefit vulnerable species in hollow trees could also contribute to preventing the decline of important, irreplaceable species. Clearing regrowth is predicted to increase vulnerable species richness by 75-100%, specialist richness by 65%, and to benefit two generalist species. Regrowth clearance is likely to be similarly beneficial in all oak-based habitats with hollow trees across Europe and North America. Increased oak circumference and local habitat quantity were also beneficial for species richness and influenced species composition. Based on this we provide advice for targeting conservation action. We suggest economic, carbon and recreational benefits of clearance that could increase the attractiveness of conservation for policy-makers. We show the importance of examining large-scale conservation planning principles at a local scale to elicit how they work on the ground where conservation actually happens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Geodiversity is a rather new, emerging topic in earth science. There is now increased awareness of our need to understand patterns of geodiversity in different landscapes facing global change. In this study, we systematically inventoried geodiversity and topographical parameters in an area of 285 km(2) in subarctic Finland. We quantified the spatial variation of geodiversity using four different measures and analysed the relationship between geodiversity and topography using a spatial grid system at a landscape scale (the size of the analysis window was 500 x 500 m). The number of different elements of geodiversity (total geodiversity) varied from 2 to 22 per grid cell. The spatial pattern of the total geodiversity, geomorphological process variability and geodiversity index were fairly similar, whereas of the other geodiversity measures, the measure of temporal diversity differed the most. Topographically, the high-diversity sites occurred in rather steep-sided valleys. Areas of high geodiversity reflect heterogeneous abiotic conditions where both erosion and accumulation processes play a major role in landscape development. The mapping of geodiversity may be indicative not only in the context of geomorphology, but also provide a focus for conservation initiatives. From a conservation point of view, the lack of wider knowledge of the distribution of geodiversity and its relationship to biodiversity hinders the protection of ecologically and geomorphologically valuable regions. Thus, we recommend that further studies focus on: (1) quantifying spatial patterns of geodiversity in different regions, (2) determining the key drivers that control the variability of geodiversity and (3) exploring the linkage between geodiversity and biodiversity.

AB  - How do different ways of governing urban indigenous social spaces facilitate or frustrate local indigenous self-government? A major challenge in Norway is the absence of actors that represent the entire local indigenous population. The main Norwegian Sami NGO is a driving force in establishing and governing indigenous spaces, but is now one of several and often competing organizations due to specialization (new organizations form to promote specific subgroups' interests) and partisanization (organizations compete in elections to the Samediggi representative organ). Social media facilitate communication across organizational divides, but do not produce any unified local indigenous voice. Private businesses and public cultural institutions take part in establishing and governing indigenous spaces - the former often in complete autonomy from Sami NGOs, the latter more likely to seek cooperation or coordination. Local and regional state-based actors generally do not take initiatives to establish indigenous spaces, but involve themselves as co-organizers with Sami leads and as sources of (often unstable) economic support. The state-based Samediggi is increasingly proactive: financing, facilitating contact between actors, and occasionally participating directly in urban indigenous governance. The Samediggi provides a unifying representative voice at the macro level that is missing at the local level.

AB  - Future sea level rise as a consequence of global warming will affect the world's coastal regions. Even though the pace of sea level rise is not clear, the consequences will be severe and global. Commonly the effects of future sea level rise are investigated for relatively vulnerable development countries; however, a whole range of varying regions needs to be considered in order to improve the understanding of global consequences. In this paper we investigate consequences of future sea level rise along the coast of the Baltic Sea island of Gotland, Sweden, with the aim to fill knowledge gaps regarding comparatively well-suited areas in developed countries. We study both the quantity of the loss of features of infrastructure, cultural, and natural value in the case of a 2 m sea level rise of the Baltic Sea and the effects of climate change on seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers, which indirectly cause saltwater intrusion in wells. We conduct a multi-criteria risk analysis by using lidar data on land elevation and GIS-vulnerability mapping, which gives the application of distance and elevation parameters formerly unimaginable precision. We find that in case of a 2 m sea level rise, 3 % of the land area of Gotland, corresponding to 99 km(2), will be inundated. The features most strongly affected are items of touristic or nature value, including camping places, shore meadows, sea stack areas, and endangered plants and species habitats. In total, 231 out of 7354 wells will be directly inundated, and the number of wells in the high-risk zone for saltwater intrusion in wells will increase considerably. Some valuable features will be irreversibly lost due to, for example, inundation of sea stacks and the passing of tipping points for seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers; others might simply be moved further inland, but this requires considerable economic means and prioritization. With nature tourism being one of the main income sources of Gotland, monitoring and planning are required to meet the changes. Seeing Gotland in a global perspective, this island shows that holistic multi-feature studies of future consequences of sea level rise are required to identify overall consequences for individual regions.

AB  - Compared with many European countries, Finland has a shorter history of immigration. During the last 20 years, Finland has become a more multicultural society. Together with rising levels of immigration, teachers' concerns regarding how to manage an increasingly diverse school population have arisen. There are an increasing number of students with different cultural and native language backgrounds in Finnish schools. However, the school system is far from being an all-encompassing multicultural environment for all. Notwithstanding, there are already many practices that do work. In this study, we aimed to find existing practices that, from the point of view of teachers, make immigrant education work. The data consists of interviews with nine teachers who work with immigrant children in schools where the educational language is Finnish. The interviews have been analysed to classify good practices in Finnish immigrant education. Our results show that in addition to adequate lingual support, fluent co-teaching and co-planning in schools, utilising school assistants' working time and skills in various and creative ways have turned out to be effective for the learning and social integration of multicultural students. Carefully and individually planned transitions from preparatory classes to general education also seem to be important. Most of the good practices that teachers mentioned were associated with transplanting the Finnish language and culture onto the 'others'. Scrutinising the thoughts and attitudes behind these good practices would help to create even better, more multicultural ways of arranging education for cultural diversity, which is inclusive of native Finnish students.

AB  - Sustainable global energy production is back-stopped by hydropower which is responsible for a significant share of the green energy produced worldwide. Hydropower, however, does not come without some environmental impacts but has worked to reduce those impacts. Here, we discuss the historical, legislative, and design configurations of hydropower facilities located in three of the world's most important producers: Brazil, Canada, and Norway. The background is intended to inform the collection of scientific papers from each country aimed at assessing and improving the sustainability of hydropower production that form the core of this special issue on sustainable hydropower. We review the development and key legislative history for hydropower in each country and point out the common backgrounds and interests each nation has in the continued sustainable development of its hydropower resources.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) represent one of the major threats to biodiversity globally. Each member state in the EU is required to compile a management plan for IAS of Union concern. This requires risk assessments to prioritize management measures consistent with the requirements of each EU member state. Here, we review the management priorities for the 88 IAS of Union concern based on the risk assessment scheme developed for Finland. Of 88 species, 52 had not been detected in Finland and 51 species were categorized as species that fail to succeed in Finland. Climatic conditions can be regarded as a major factor limiting the success of those species. Five primary management categories were recognized. Monitoring was deemed the primary management option for 30 species, prevention of entry into Finland for 30 species, prevention of escape into nature for 17 species, prevention of further spread and/or the management of areas with high biodiversity value for 4 species and eradication for 7 species. It is concluded that national management plans should consider local environmental conditions and adjust management options according to national risk assessments.

AB  - 1. Capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan mortality resulting from collisions with high tension power lines (11-420 kV) was estimated, based on the number of casualties found per kilometre of power line patrolled in three boreal forest and low alpine areas.
   2. The length (km) of high tension power lines crossing tetraonid habitats was estimated using Geographical Information Systems and general knowledge about species-specific habitats. Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55% was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56% black grouse habitats and 16% willow ptarmigan habitats.
   3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90%, 47% and 9% of the annual hunting harvest of these species.
   4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.

AB  - Over the last decades, many wild goose populations have increased significantly and are now causing conflicts with socioeconomic and biological interests. To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pinkfooted geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trondelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.

AB  - The potential contribution of plantation forests to the conservation of woodland plant diversity needs to be assessed in order for commitments to Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) to be fulfilled. To this end, the plant communities of mature Sitka spruce, Norway spruce, Japanese larch and ash plantations were compared with those of semi-natural oak and ash woodlands at 75 sites across the island of Ireland. A number of different plant communities were recognized in plantations, with only one resembling either of the semi-natural woodland types studied. The exception was a community of ash plantations on baserich soils, on or adjacent to historic woodland, which was similar to the semi-natural ash woodland community. Despite supporting a plant community similar to semi-natural ash woodlands, the ash plantations supported significantly fewer woodland species. While none of the other plantation communities strongly resembled either the semi-natural oak or ash communities, they had the potential to support high numbers of woodland species. A range of forestry (forest type, canopy cover, grazing), geographic (elevation, historic woodland) and edaphic variables (soil pH, drainage) were found to be important in determining the types of plant communities and numbers of woodland species supported. While geographic and edaphic factors are either impossible or difficult to control, considerable scope exists for enhancing the plant diversity of plantation forests through changes in forest planning and management.

AB  - A sampling view of the colonization of small habitat fragments by birds is based on the assumption that individual birds acquire territories in the fragments randomly, and their occurrence frequencies follow from abundances in the regional species pool. We tested the following predictions of this view using bird census data from a fragment ''archipelago'' in the southern Finnish taiga: (1) the location of breeding pairs varies randomly among the fragments from year to year, and (2) the pattern of species accrual with increasing sample size is similar to random sampling. The data agreed with the predictions. For most species the distribution of pairs in the fragments agreed with the Poisson prediction. The pattern of species turnover in single fragments agreed with the sampling view so that an average fragment had about 10 pairs of 7 species in a single breeding season, and about 40 pairs of 13 species over the 4-yr period. The sampling model is a ''null'' assumption that should be considered when assessing the occurrence of birds in small habitat fragments. This requirement defines methodological imperatives that have often been violated in ornithological studies; we discuss such methodological problems. The sampling model implies that local turnover in small fragments may be a mechanical reflection of change in territory location from year to year and disconnected from population dynamics. In such a case, apparent ''extinctions'' and ''recolonizations'' in single fragments are ecologically trivial. Assessing the interface between sampling colonization and genuine metapopulation dynamics is an urgent challenge for conservation ecology, particularly in temperate and boreal areas.

AB  - In this study, which presents pollen, charcoal, and 'soot'-particle records from a lacustrine sediment core, the development of the cultural landscape around Lake Dalkarby trask on the Aland Islands in Finland is scrutinised and discussed within a broad temporal setting in order to clarify the long-term interplay between the environment and human activities in this part of the archipelago. Special emphasis is given to the transition period from the Late Iron Age to medieval times due to the dominating humanistic discourse on the settlement dynamics in this region, as in the Aland archipelago in general, arguing for an approximately 150-years-long hiatus in habitation between these two periods, from AD 1050 to 1200. Our results do not support the hiatus theories but show a long and continuous history of the utilisation of land and forest resources starting from prehistoric times. The forests were first cleared with fire for slash-and-burn cultivation. Thereafter, structural diversity in the landscape started to increase. By 1240, the pollen data portrays a picture of a developed agrarian community with a subsistence economy based on arable farming and animal husbandry in which hemp seems to play a substantial part.

AB  - Forest management is an important tool for GHG mitigation by representing three carbon pools: living biomass, forest soil, and wood-based products. Additionally, increasing attention has been given to the potential for wood products to substitute fossil-intensive products as a climate mitigation strategy. The goal of this paper is to analyse the theoretical GHG effects of fully replacing four common non-wood products with wood-based products of 'low' and 'high' technology options that have a similar functionality: (1) Spruce particle board substituting polyurethane (PU) foam insulation board; (2) spruce cross-laminated timber beam (CLT) substituting steel beam; (3) birch energy wood substituting electric heating; and (4) birch plywood substituting plaster board. The analysis was based on forestry in Western Norway as a case study, where forests typically consist of naturally generated birch and expanding areas of planted Norway spruce. In this study we compare wood products derived from paired stands of Norway spruce and downy birch. The analysis showed that spruce gave a higher theoretical substitution effect relative to birch for the selected pairs of woody and non-woody products. CLT substituting steel beam gave the highest substitution effect, approximately 15% higher than particle board substituting PU foam board. The theoretical substitution effect in mass units of carbon per kg wood product for the two spruce wood products was approximately 17 times higher relative to substituting Norwegian hydro energy-based electric heating, whereas plywood substituting plaster board may in fact increase GHG emissions. As the gross emissions were relatively similar for the birch plywood and the spruce particle board, the major substitution effect was related to the avoided emission of the non-woody product rather than to the tree species per se. The paper concludes that the choice of product to be substituted was the key factor that determined the final substitution effects. Furthermore, the study showed that transportation was the single most important factor that affected the emissions between planting and delivery of the timber at production gate. The analysis enables informed decisions related to CO2-emissions at the various steps from tree planting to wood conversion, and underline the importance of informed decision related to the choice of substitution products.

AB  - This paper discusses the complexity and multidimensionality of ethnic representations in tourism promotion. In existing studies of indigenous tourism it has been emphasized how the representations of ethnicity are created, implemented and filtered through certain cultural and ideological structures, connected to wider political processes of othering and marginalization. This paper analyzes the representations of Saminess in Finnish Lapland tourism brochures by counter-reading material against the theoretical viewpoints in which Sami culture and people are perceived as othered discourses within Finnish Lapland tourism promotion. Through the analyses of Sami representations it is demonstrated how tourism brochures not only promote places but that they can also produce politically loaded discourses and present power issues that reflect the political structures of the surrounding society. The paper also discusses the social aspects of the prevalent media climate in ethnic and indigenous issues from a wider perspective and, furthermore, ponders in what ways these touristic representations reflect the general discourse of minority and indigenous issues.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a large-scale boom in mining in the present-day Swedish part of Sapmi, leading to protests from Sami activists as well as environmentalist groups. To the protesters, issues of Swedish colonialism and Sami indigeneity are central, and history becomes important. Taking its starting point in the mining conflicts, this article discusses Sami archaeology and claims for Sami indigenous land and cultural rights. We argue that it is important to further explore the colonial history in Sapmi, and its meaning and consequences today. Archaeology can contribute with new perspectives on colonial histories and relations, and connections between past and present in Sapmi. At the same time, many issues concerning the ethics and politics of archaeology need to be discussed. Furthermore, in discussions on Sami archaeology and heritage management in Sapmi, it is important to consider experiences from the international fields of postcolonial studies and indigenous archaeology.

AB  - Damming and water regulation creates highly modified rivers with limited ecosystem integrity and resilience. This, coupled with an ongoing global biodiversity crisis, makes river restoration a priority, which requires water reallocation. Coupled human-natural systems research provides a suitable lens for integrated systems' analysis but offers limited insight into the governance processes of water reallocation. Therefore, we propose an analytical framework, which combines insight from social-hydrological resilience and water reallocation research, and identifies the adaptive capacity in highly modified rivers as the capacity for water reallocation. We test the framework by conducting an analysis of Sweden, pre- and post-2019, a critical juncture in the governance of the country's hydropower producing rivers. We identify a relative increase in adaptive capacity post- 2019 since water reallocation is set to occur in smaller rivers and tributaries, while leaving large-scaled rivers to enjoy limited water reallocation, or even increased allocation to hydropower. We contend that the proposed framework is broad enough to be of general interest, yet sufficiently specific to contribute to the construction of middle-range theories, which could further our understanding of why and how governance processes function, change, and lead to outcomes in terms of modified natural resource management and resilience shifts.

AB  - The objective of this research is to investigate the extent of land-cover change in and around Stockholm from 1986 to 2006 and the nature of the resulting landscape fragmentation with a particular focus on the possible environmental impact. Four scenes of SPOT imagery over the Stockholm area were acquired for this study: two on 13 June 1986, one on 5 August 2006 and one on 4 June 2008. Various image processing and classification algorithms were tested and compared. The best classification results were obtained using an object-based and rule-based approach with texture measures as well as spectral data as inputs. The image pairs from the two decades were classified into seven land cover categories for Stockholm Municipality, i.e., low-density built-up, high-density built-up, industrial areas, open land, forest, mixed forest and open land, and water. The overall accuracies were 93% (kappa: 0.91) for 1986 and 97% (kappa: 0.96) for 2006. Landscape fragmentation and change was evaluated using spatial metrics. The spatial metric results reveal that urban areas increased at the expense of nonbuilt up areas by around 2% both on the municipal and regional levels. The 2006/2008 classification gives evidence of being a more fragmented landscape than that of 1986. While urban areas have become denser within Stockholm municipality, which is in line with the region's development policy, more natural land cover types have at the same time been eroded; a development not in line with the regional goal of maintaining the area's green spaces. The classification technique used on the municipality will be expanded to the region as a whole, and regional trends and consequent recommendations will be the focus of future research.

AB  - We made monthly surveys of > 2000 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) from 1977 to 1987 before and after the construction of the Blue Lake hydroelectric reservoir in order to study the progressive impact of infrastructure development on wildlife. Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8% of pre-development densities without significant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217% increase in use of the few remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.

AB  - In the late 1800s forestry in Finland corresponded to the present-day situation in many developing countries with a rapidly increasing number of standing trees. Now Finland's timber resources are greater than ever since people began to exploit forests and its forestry is exemplary in many respects. The dependence of the Finnish economy on wood raw material has, however, become weaker and weaker. Consequently, Finns have begun to speak of the forest cluster which does not only include forestry and the forest industry but all the economic activities derived from or connected to the forest sector. By adopting this new concept Finns try to prepare their economy far the future where know-how is more important to the success of nations than raw materials or traditional industrial processes. This will also give more room for the ecological and social sustainability in the Finnish forests where growing wood for the needs of the industry was almost the only target until the early 1990s.

AB  - Urban sustainable development is today seen as one of the keys towards unlocking the quest for a sustainable world. One feature of urban sustainability is the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. For many of these developments, guiding sustainability documents are developed to frame future goals. However, few of these documents specify on which grounds they determine the sustainability of goals and they are largely developed as independent islands of local sustainability. This is unfortunate as cities and their districts are fully dependent on surrounding environments. Failing to include a holistic approach into,the local planning increases the risk of sub-optimisation, future lock-ins and missed targets on a higher level. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the environmental and sustainability programme for Stockholm Royal Seaport, a new urban district in Stockholm, Sweden, can guide development of the district towards holistic ecological sustainability. By using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development a holistic template for an ecologically sustainable planet has been described, important sectors for the built environment have been identified and the environmental and sustainability programme for the district has been analysed. This study showed that the vision and operational goals put forward in the Stockholm Royal Seaport programme complies relatively well with the designed template. However, important deviations in all sectors but land use have been identified. These deviations arise in the translation process between theory and practice. The vision for the district and the implementation phase are not aligned due to too narrow a perspective of a sustainable urban district, lack of robust sustainability principles including use of such to identify key strategic questions. In addition to the lack of an all-embracing conceptual framework, there is also a lack of structures for cooperation between stakeholders and conflicts between local and regional agendas. Use of a unifying framework can describe desirable future scenarios where the local level does not contribute to violation of the universal sustainability principles and identify step-wise routes towards such scenarios.

AB  - Norway has been signatory to the Council of Europe's Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (1979) (otherwise known as the "Bern Convention") since 1986. Nevertheless, every year, Norwegian authorities authorize the killing of brown bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines, which are listed as strictly protected fauna species by the Bern Convention. Norway has a responsibility to protect these species and has several times been brought to court by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for failure to satisfy their duties under this international legal instrument. This article discusses Norway's large predator policy and its compliance with the Bern Convention through an analysis of court decisions and judicial reasoning from the perspective of species justice for nonhumans.

AB  - Hydropower is today the most important kind of renewable and sustainable energy. Resources of hydropower are widely spread around the world. Hydro energy is the most reliable and cost effective renewable energy source. It is obvious that among all the renewable energies, hydropower occupies the place in the world, and it will keep this place for many years to come. Hydroelectric energy is responsible worldwide for some 2600 TWh of electricity output per year, which means about 20% of the world's entire electricity demand, making it one of the most reliable and cost effective renewable energy sources. In 2001, the largest hydropower generating countries were Canada (333.0 TWh), the United States (201.2 TWh) and Norway (120.4 TWh). Hydroelectric power consumption in the EU grew by nearly 27% between 1991 and 2001. In 2001, hydro accounted for approximately 5% of total EU power consumption. France is the EU's largest producer of hydroelectricity. In 2001, generation capacity of hydropower was about 25,000 MW in France.

AB  - Sweden is not on track to meet its own national 2020 environmental goals for sustainable forests. Due to the deliberate design of Swedish forest policy, private forest owners? voluntary forest and biodiversity protection efforts are required to help close the policy gap. Using survey data from Swedish family forest owners, this paper outlines how forest owner attitudes reveal challenges and opportunities for two general strategies to increasing forest and biodiversity protection. The first strategy is attempting to institute changes within status quo Swedish forest policy by relying on family forest owners to make such changes voluntarily. The second strategy is encouraging management changes by using policy reforms. Our qualitative results suggest that Swedish forest policy is close to the limit of what can be accomplished with volunteerism alone and likely requires policy reforms to close its forest and biodiversity protection gap on family-owned forests.

AB  - In northern industrialized countries, the inland fisheries sector has long been dominated by recreational fisheries, which normally exploit fish for leisure or subsistence and provide many (poorly investigated) benefits to society. Various factors constrain the development and existence of inland fisheries, such as local user conflicts, low social priority and inadequate research and funding. In many cases, however, degradation of the environment and loss of aquatic habitat are the predominant concerns for the sustainability of inland fisheries. The need for concerted effort to prevent and reduce environmental degradation, as well as conservation of freshwater fish and fisheries as renewable common pool resources or entities in their own right is the greatest challenge facing sustainable development of inland waters. In inland fisheries management, the declining quality of the aquatic environment coupled with long-term inadequate and often inappropriate fisheries management has led to an emphasis on enhancement practices, such as stocking, to mitigate anthropogenic stress. However, this is not always the most appropriate management approach. Therefore, there is an urgent need to alter many traditional inland fisheries management practices and systems to focus on sustainable development.
   This paper reviews the literature regarding the inputs needed for sustainability of inland fisheries in industrialized countries. To understand better the problems facing sustainable inland fisheries management, the inland fisheries environment, its benefits, negative impacts and constraints, as well as historical management, paradigms, trends and current practices are described. Major philosophical shifts, challenges and promising integrated management approaches are envisaged in a holistic framework. The following are considered key elements for sustainable development of inland fisheries: communication, information dissemination, education, institutional restructuring, marketing outreach, management plans, decision analysis, socioeconomic evaluation and research into the human dimension, in addition to traditional biological and ecological sciences. If these inputs are integrated with traditional fisheries management practices, the prospects for sustainability in the inland fisheries will be enhanced.

AB  - This paper contributes to deliberations about wellbeing in relation to home spaces by considering how professional expectations and everyday experiences of the neighbourhood, as an extension of home, relate to the cultural situatedness of individuals in Sweden. To do so, it presents and discusses findings from a case-based investigation of two developments in Stockholm that represent contemporary urban design and neighbour-hood planning efforts influenced by New Urbanism. Building on the work of Lefebvre, Massey and others, our findings reveal a particularly Swedish construct of place that allows for and celebrates the interplay between an individual's cosy home environment extending into the public and communal spaces of their neighbourhood, with more complex or challenging urbanity beyond. Future research could examine neighbourhoods situated elsewhere to understand the extent to which similar experiences or social meanings exist outside of the Swedish context, and what impacts on community formation and human wellbeing result.

AB  - There are various sources available for examination of Icelandic attitudes to Norway and Norwegians from 1814 to the Second World War. Although the attitudes of Icelanders were not identical in every way, generalizations can be made. After the dissolution of the union between Denmark and Norway in 1814, Iceland and Norway did not belong to the same state, but in the course of time connections between the two countries increased in various fields. The close historical ties between the two countries and a common cultural heritage, Iceland having been largely settled from Norway and later becoming part of the Norwegian state, had a bearing on the attitudes of many Icelanders towards the country and its inhabitants. To some Icelanders, a journey to Norway was something like a pilgrimage. Icelanders were impressed with the Norwegian landscape and thought positively about the nation. They took much interest in contemporary Norwegian culture and greatly enjoyed the literature of the country. Many Icelanders had a positive attitude to the New Norwegian language. Some popular movements in Norway had considerable influence in Iceland; for example, the Norwegian Youth Societies Movement, den frilynte ungdomsrorsla, was a model for the influential Icelandic Youth Societies Movement. In some ways, Norway was seen as a model by many Icelanders as regards political and economic development. In their struggle for increased self-government within the Danish state, many Icelanders were encouraged by what they saw as progress in Norway, the country being in practice nearly independent within the union with Sweden until achieving statehood in 1905. Icelanders also looked to Norway as an example of progress in farming and fishing. Examined in the context of the Icelanders' attitudes to other countries, their feelings towards Norway and Norwegians were particularly positive.

AB  - I analyse ecological and cultural change as an intertwined, simultaneous process using a summer cottage habitation as a case. This habitation developed during the 20th century on the shores of Lake Roine, in southwestern Finland, My aim is to identify spatial and temporal scales constituted by the process, as well as its ecological influences in connection with socio-economic changes and ecohistorical layers of the area. The results indicate that the emergence of summer cottage culture is breaking the dichotomies between urban and rural and also merges different time horizons. Remarkable context dependence was found when the ecological influences were evaluated in relation to traditional peasant culture and modem silviculture. The present summer cottage occupants of the lake are often tightly engaged with their site by managing it and reusing artefacts innovatively. As managers they reflect both peasant and urban mentalities, and having great variation in management practices they create potentials for further changes in the ecosocial system.

AB  - Traditionally, the transport literature reflects the view that traffic volumes, road traffic volumes in particular, are coupled with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Recently published literature also argues that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from transport, passenger cars in particular, have not shown any decoupling from transport volumes for some years. This article presents a theoretical framework for decoupling, defining the difference between decoupling, coupling and negative decoupling. These are further broken down to weak, strong and expansive/recessive degrees of decoupling, laying emphasis on the absolute increase or decrease of the variables. The result section presents data of the development of the relationships between GDP, traffic volumes and CO2 emissions from transport in the EU15 countries between 1970 and 2001, including the special case of Finnish road traffic. The aggregate EU15 data show a change from expansive negative decoupling to expansive coupling regarding passenger transport, and from weak decoupling to expansive negative decoupling regarding freight transport. Weak decoupling of transport CO2 emissions from GDP could also be observed. Weak decoupling of all the three aspects (freight, passenger and CO2) could be seen in the UK, Sweden and Finland in the 1990s. In Finland, the statistics show weak decoupling of GDP from road traffic volume and strong decoupling of road traffic volume and CO2 emissions from road traffic between 1990 and 2001. Four hypothetical explanations of the Finnish phenomenon are put forward in this article: policy towards sustainable mobility, green urban lifestyle, increasing income differences, and statistical misinterpretation. Each explanation is backed up with some quantitative evidence in observable trends in Finland during the 1990s. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An overall societal aim is to ensure a sustainable use and management of agricultural landscapes. This requires continuous delivery of reliable and up-to-date information to decision-makers. To be able to deliver this information, a monitoring program for agricultural landscapes was initiated in Norway 13 years ago. The program documents and reports on land use / land cover changes from data captured through interpretation of true colour aerial photos using stereo instruments. The monitoring programme is based on a sample of 1000 squares of 1 x 1 km and the entire sample of squares is photographed over a five-year period. Each square is then mapped repeatedly every fifth year to record changes.
   Aerial photo interpretation is based on a custom classification system which is built up hierarchically, with three levels. The first level comprises seven land type classes: Agricultural land, Bare ground, Semi-natural open vegetation, Unforested wetland vegetation, Forest, Urban areas and Water. These land classes are further divided into 24 land types at level two, and approximately 100 land types at level 3. In addition to land type units we map both line elements like stone fences and point elements like buildings and solitary threes. By use of indicators that describe status and change focusing on themes of particular policy interest, we can report on whether policy aims are being fulfilled or not. Four indicator themes have been in focus hitherto: landscape spatial structure, biological diversity, cultural heritage and accessibility.
   Our data is stored in databases and most of the data quality check/structure process and analyses are now being made in open source software like PostGIS and PostSQL. To assess the accuracy of the photo-interpretation, ground truthing is carried out on 10 % of the squares. The results of this operation document the benefits of having access to photos of the same area from two different years. The program is designed first and foremost to provide reliable statistics at a national level but the aim is also to report at regional levels - for example for counties or for agricultural landscape regions. The national coverage and application of standardized methods enable frequent updating. This method is cost effective and enables us to quantify changes in landscape qualities as well as adapting the programme to take account of e.g. new findings on relevant indicators.

AB  - Detailed spatial data are an essential part of land use planning and decision-making. Their spatial resolution sets limitations to their use, as coarse datasets are not suitable for detecting small-scale phenomena. In this study, we explored the effects of spatial resolution on the ecological outcome of a conservation prioritization process in Zonation software. Our study area was in Evo, southern Finland, covering a mosaic of managed and conserved forests. We produced the feature layers describing the forest characteristics using high-resolution remote sensing datasets, object-based mapping methods, and forest site type data. We found that increasing the resolution above the 16 m baseline resolution resulted in substantial errors. The conservation errors were the highest for rare features related to European Aspen, whereas the common features related to dominant tree species could benefit from the growth of cell size. We conclude that adequate spatial resolution is a prerequisite for efficient conservation prioritization, and that the size and spatial distribution of the features affect the resolution requirements.

AB  - Wood harvested from logging residues, pre-commercial and conservation thinnings is increasingly being used as biofuel as a substitute for fossil fuels. Here, we review the additional impact that wood harvesting for energy purposes has on species of conservation interest (SCI) in Swedish forests compared with the effects of conventional management, a perspective that largely has not been taken into consideration. We compiled data from 122 studies of forest fuel extraction with short- and long-term perspectives at the stand and landscape level to examine whether the effects on SCI are due to an additional loss of bio-diversity as a result of cutting old forest or owing to competition from species that are favoured by the habitats formed by clearcutting. We also consider whether forest bioenergy extractions can be used to favour conservation values. The amount of logging residues has, in parallel to the amount of annually harvested trees, doubled during the past 50 years in Sweden and constitutes the major source of dead wood for biodiversity in managed forests. Common wood-inhabiting species, predominantly fungi, beetles and other insects, and to some extent lichens, are the main species affected by wood harvesting for energy purposes. The main cause for the decline of SCI is the impact already imposed by conventional forest management: clearcutting old forest stands with subsequent soil scarification. Few SCI survive clear-felling because these species typically require other types of conditions and substrates than the new dead-wood substrate created after clear-felling. We conclude that the logging residues of conifers could potentially be harvested with small to negligible impacts on SCI. However, owing to the limited number of landscape level analyses that have been performed and the inherent difficulties of assessing the effects of wood harvesting on rare SCI, we suggest that these findings need to be treated with caution and that further studies should be undertaken. Hardwood conservation thinnings and brushwood harvest may improve conservation values. Developing operational guidelines to help to mitigate ecological damage to biodiversity should be based on cautionary principles and requires further large-scale and long-term research.

AB  - Background: The urban freight transportation (UFT) system is an essential facilitator for the smooth functioning of city logistics. It also contributes significantly to transportation-related issues, such as vehicular congestion, pollution, accidents, infrastructure damage and other related problems.
   Objectives: This study aimed to understand and compare the urban freight traffic characteristics and their impact in two cities: Gothenburg, Sweden and Delhi, India, having high socio-economic differences. The findings of this study will be helpful for practitioners and policymakers in the development and successful implementation of UFT management policies.
   Method: Using the cordon count (traffic data), retailers' interviews (receivers' data) and freight vehicle drivers' interviews, UFT characteristics such as sector-specific contribution, trip characteristics, vehicular characteristics and negative impacts in terms of external cost to society are evaluated. This study also discusses the prediction of attracted trips in the study zone using freight trip attraction (models.
   Results: About 75% of the trips in Gothenburg and 92% of the trips in Delhi are made by light commercial and other small-sized vehicles. Gothenburg has formally organised sectors involved in freight vehicle movement; however, Delhi has informally organised sectors.
   Conclusion: The results revealed substantial differences in characteristics of freight trip operations in both the cities, compared with few similarities. Measures taken considering the specific local attributes of freight traffic and stakeholders' requirement may lead to a sustainable transportation system in cities.

AB  - The Scarce Copper (Lycaena virgaureae) is a species that has suffered serious decline in several European countries. In Scandinavia it is still comparatively abundant, but with ongoing losses of flower-rich grasslands near forests further decline is expected. A mark-release-recapture study was carried out in July 2013 at 14 sites on the outskirts of a village located near Malmo, Sweden. The study area comprised in total an 11.4 ha network of abandoned agricultural sites, road verges and forest edges. A private garden was also included. Butterflies were marked individually and the capture position was recorded by GPS. Sex, behaviour and flower visits were also recorded. During the study 852 butterflies were marked and 170 of these were recaptured at least once (recapture rate 20 %), resulting in 1,078 captures (including multiple recaptures). Movement between patches accounted for 41 % of all recaptures and mean distance between recaptures was 112 +/- A 146 m (n = 226). The number of captures was strongly positively correlated with patch size (rho = 0.95, p < 0.05), while the emigrant and immigrant fractions were significantly negatively correlated with patch size. Overall, the Scarce Copper was surprisingly abundant in the area, but planned construction of residential areas will result in the loss of most habitat patches.

AB  - Genetic diversity is a key part of biodiversity, threatened by human activities that lead to loss of gene flow and reduction of effective population sizes. Gene flow is a result of both landscape connectivity and demographic processes determining the number of dispersing individuals in space and time. Thus, the effect of human impact on processes determining the level of genetic diversity must be interpreted in the context of basic ecological conditions affecting survival and recruitment. When the intensity of human impact and habitat suitability correlate, the effect on genetic diversity and gene flow may be challenging to predict. We compared genetic diversity, gene flow and landscape resistance in two contrasting landscapes in Norway for the pond-breeding amphibian Triturus cristatus: a highly human-impacted, agricultural landscape with ecologically productive habitats, and a forested landscape with less productive habitats and lower levels of human impact. Our results show that genetic diversity was higher and gene flow lower within the forested landscape. Microclimatic moisture conditions and vegetation cover were important determinants of landscape resistance to gene flow within both landscapes. There were indications that landscape resistance was increased by minor roads in the forested landscape, which was not the case for the agricultural landscape, suggesting a higher vulnerability to human interference within the landscape matrix for the populations in less productive habitats. Our findings suggest that the effect of human impact on genetic diversity may not be straightforward but modulated by the ecological conditions underlying local demographic processes. Populations within both landscapes seem to be vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity, but due to different mechanisms. This has implications for the choice of relevant management actions, that is, increasing population stability may be more relevant within an agricultural landscape still permeable for dispersal, while conserving dispersal corridors may be more appropriate in the forested landscape, to avoid isolation and increased genetic drift.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) that are applied in the planning phases of large land-use and construction projects are aimed at aiding decision-making and mitigating significant environmental impacts. In light of the global biodiversity crisis, conducting high-quality biodiversity impact assessments is important, as biodiversity information, among other factors, has the potential to influence how projects will be implemented in the end. We investigated the biodiversity and bird surveys conducted and the number of bird species of conservation concern in peat extraction and wind farm projects to which an EIA was applied to in 1995-2016 in Finland and compared whether these factors differed between the project types and between implemented and unimplemented projects. We also studied the availability of follow-up monitoring data of biodiversity impacts within the two project types. The number of nationally threatened breeding birds was significantly lower in implemented than in unimplemented peat extraction projects. The overall probability of being implemented was significantly negatively associated with the year the EIA began for both project types. All permitted peat extraction projects and 22% of wind farm projects conducted post-construction biodiversity monitoring; however, only some projects enabled before-after comparisons. Our results are in line with earlier findings that demonstrate the difficulty of showing the direct impacts of biodiversity information on EIA decision-making and to what extent it is related to project approval or rejection. The role of follow-up monitoring in the EIA and project development could also be strengthened.

AB  - Temporal conservation contracts are used to protect biodiversity in privately owned lands worldwide. We examine how stand characteristics and habitat requirements of target species affect the contract length in a boreal forest context We develop an integrated optimization model and apply the model with data on endangered species occurring in spruce forests in Finland. The results suggest that a cost-effective conservation policy for protecting privately owned forest land involves both short- and long-term contracts between landowners and environmental agencies. The higher the conservation objective, the more intensively long-term contracts should be assigned. Managed stands should be assigned short-term contracts. Regarding unmanaged stands both short- and long-term contracts should be used. However, species habitat requirements affect the results and thus the conservation policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of a transdisciplinary scenario planning workshop that was designed to link global challenges to local governance. The workshop was held to improve stakeholder integration and explore scenarios for a regional planning project (to 2050) in Blekinge, Sweden. Scenario planning and transdisciplinary practices are often disregarded by practitioners due to the perception of onerous resource requirements, however, this paper describes a 'rapid scenario planning' process that was designed to be agile and time-efficient, requiring the 43 participants from 13 stakeholder organizations to gather only for one day. The process was designed to create an environment whereby stakeholders could learn from, and with, each other and use their expert knowledge to inform the scenario process. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) was used to structure and focus the scenario planning exercise and its subsequent recommendations. The process was evaluated through a workshop participant survey and post-workshop evaluative interview with the regional government project manager to indicate the effectiveness of the approach. The paper closes with a summary of findings which will support those wishing to conduct similar rapid scenario planning exercises to inform policy planning for complex systems.

AB  - Increasing the attractiveness of public transport is a key issue in the endeavours towards more sustainable transport systems. While there is a lot of knowledge on what can be done to increase public transport patronage, there is a lack of empirically based research analysing how to do this in practice. Using a comparative case analysis of six regions in Sweden with the highest increase in passenger volumes for public transport between 2009 and 2015, this paper examines the prerequisites for increasing public transport patronage, with a focus on the governance conditions required to implement such measures. The empirical material consists of semi structured interviews with public transport planners and strategy documents for the six regions. The findings show that all regions but one employed a similar approach and implemented measures aimed at concentrating resources to corridors where the potential demand was the greatest. Only one region chose a different approach by investing in services in both strong routes and in the peripheral network. However, regardless of approach, the results highlight that there is considerable coherence regarding the governance conditions that enable implementation. Three main conditions were identified, namely political support, well-functioning collaboration between organisations, and public support through citizen dialogue. The results support key findings on collaborative conditions from previous research, including the importance of joint objectives, trust between key individuals, and the need for long time frames in order to develop collaborative capacity.

AB  - Europe is characterized not only by large geomorphological variability but also by a long history of land use. This resulted in a highly variegated landscape. Based on the IGBP-transect initiative, a north south transect was established across Europe ranging from north Sweden to central Italy in order to study effects of global change. Mainly process oriented studies were established on plots along the transect, and these were used to establish functional relationships as basis for landscape integration. However, it became apparent that the transect approach was not sufficient to mirror the European environment. From early on, the assessment of land cover was not constrained to this transect but complemented with measurements focused on Europe at a continental scale. Also, continental networks of flux measurements and ecosystem experiments were established, because these were able to encompass a larger inherent variability of climate, geology and land use. Resulting from the Kyoto protocol emphasis moved stronger from observations along transects towards a continental scale quantification of fluxes given the reporting needs. In this process the transect and the networks merged into research clusters, which provided a scaling and verification mechanism. Thus, the European situation may serve as an example of how the initial idea of transects has further evolved and broadened to continental scale studies in a region where anthropogenic land use dominates over climate change.

AB  - To stop the decline of the European eel population, one of the measures taken is translocating eels for restocking, despite its conservational value being largely unknown. We aimed to contribute to this knowledge gap by (i) investigating the origin of eels caught in coastal waters of Estonia and Finland using otolith microchemistry and (ii) directly estimating restocked eel escapement from Narva River Basin District (NRBD), which is part of the primary Eel Management Unit in Estonia. In Estonia, 74% of the sampled eels (n = 140) were natural recruits and 26% were restocked. In Finland, 27% of the sampled eels (n = 235) were natural recruits and 73% were restocked. Only 1% of all the coastally collected eels were originally restocked to NRBD. These new data together with the reported commercial landings from the escapement route conflict with the current silver eel escapement estimation for NRBD and question the accuracy and value of such indirect calculations compiled for most Eel Management Units throughout the European Union. It is concluded that restocking eels to freshwaters may be futile as a conservation measure in some situations, and better escapement is likely achieved in restocking eels to coastal waters or undammed freshwater systems with a direct connection to the sea.

AB  - The growing economies in the South, market globalization, population growth, social conflicts and climate change increase the strain on land and forest resources, and require a cost effective and ecologically sound production of goods and services to meet public needs. Based on global assessment data, four country level (Ethiopia, China, Vietnam, Sweden) and six local case studies and using a multi-scale approach, this paper examines trends and drivers in household based plantation forestry and reviews how policies affecting forest plantation and land use are interpreted and implemented at the local level. It discusses how sustainable forestry systems and policies can be developed which provide industrial supplies, promote environmental objectives and support the livelihoods of people. Besides reflecting characteristics and diversity of current trends in plantation forestry, the paper illustrates that local landscape studies could help in explaining trends revealed by national inventories in a way relevant to policy and research.

AB  - So far, consumer housing values have not been addressed as factors affecting the market diffusion potential of multi-storey wood building (MSWB). To fill the void, this study addresses different types of consumer housing values in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden (i.e., Nordic region), and whether they affect the likelihood of prejudices against building with wood in the housing markets. The data collected in 2018 from 2191 consumers in the Nordic region were analyzed with exploratory factor analysis and logistic binary regression analysis. According to the results, consumers' perceptions on ecological sustainability, material usage and urban lifestyle were similar in all countries, while country-specific differences were detected for perceptions on aesthetics and natural milieus. In all countries, appreciating urban lifestyle and living in attractive neighborhoods with good reputation increased the likelihood of prejudices against wood building, while appreciation of aesthetics and natural milieus decreased the likelihood of prejudices. In strengthening the demand for MSWB and sustainable urbanization through actions in businesses (e.g., branding) and via public policy support (e.g., land zoning), few messages derive from the results. In all, abreast with the already existing knowledge on the supply side factors (e.g., wood building innovations), more customized information is needed on the consumer-driven issues affecting the demand potential of MSWB in the housing markets. This would enable, e.g., both enhancing the supply of wooden homes for consumers appreciating urban lifestyle and neighborhoods and fortifying positive image of wood among consumers especially appreciating good architecture and pleasant environmental milieus.

AB  - We studied the space use of the Siberian flying squirrel in fragmented forest landscapes in southern Finland in 1996-1999, Twenty-four adult males and 23 adult females were radio tracked in three different study areas. The use of different landscape elements by flying squirrels was compared to their availability using compositional analysis. Effects of fragmentation on flying squirrels were studied by comparing the use of different habitat types, number of used patches, and size of home range to the principal components formed from the landscape variables patch size, patch isolation, area of spruce-dominated forests, and area of other habitats with trees.
   Flying squirrels preferred spruce- and deciduous-dominated forests, but other habitats with trees were also used for moving and foraging. These less preferred habitats connected spruce and deciduous forest patches in a matrix of open areas. Males used several separate patches of preferred habitat, but females usually stayed in one patch. The spacing behaviour of males was affected by the structure of the landscape in a way that home ranges were larger and males used more spruce patches in the more highly fragmented landscape. Home-range size of females was not affected by the landscape structure. Basically, the space use of males seemed to be reflected by the location and number of female home ranges, In the study area where female density was high, the home ranges of males were small, Our results give empirical evidence of the effects of habitat loss and landscape connectivity for the Siberian flying squirrel and the implications of these for the conservation of the species.

AB  - Post-spawning migrations of sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) in two northern Swedish river systems, Vindelalven and Pitealven, were studied. Telemetry was used to evaluate spawning locations, post-spawning mortality, overwintering survival/habitat selection/location, partitioned natural mortality from dam passage mortality and overall survival from post-spawning to the sea entry. Fifty-eight sea trout (L-T = 50-86 cm) were radio-tagged at the beginning of their spawning migration from June to September in 2003 and 2004, and their spawning in September and October each year was monitored. In total, 91% (n = 53) survived spawning and were thus defined as kelts. Of these, 92% (n = 49) overwintered under ice-cover in deep, slow flowing sections of the rivers. Overwintering mortality was low, on average 8%. The main seaward migration occurred during May and June and was initiated when ambient water temperatures exceeded 4-6 degrees C, independent of the start of the spring flood when flows rose to 1000 m(3) s(-1). The highest downstream migration speed was approximately 25 km 24 h(-1) and migrations mainly took place: at daytime. During seaward migration, the kelts encountered hydropower stations that lacked bypass systems for fish passage, which delayed their downstream migrations. Passage mortality at the power stations was 69 and 25% in the Vindelalven and Pitealven, respectively. These losses, combined with the naturally high winter survivals of kelts at the unregulated river pacts, underline the importance of developing safe passage routes for kelts at hydropower facilities for conserving sea trout populations in regulated rivers.

AB  - The management of water flow using reservoirs for the purpose of hydropower production can have significant impacts on solute transport. Reducing the phosphorous load to downstream areas can be of great importance for aquatic habitats associated with recipient waters, as well as for the overall health of coastal and estuary areas. This study demonstrates a combined operation of a network of reservoirs with the objectives of hydropower production and improvement of water quality in downstream areas using a multiobjective approach and incorporating the transport of phosphorous in the watershed. A genetic optimization method was used to determine the trade-off between power production and mitigation of phosphorous discharge in the reservoir network of the Dalalven River, Sweden. The phosphorous export can be reduced (-5%) with a limited loss of power production (-4.3%), but further reduction is associated with a significant loss in total power production. The trade-off between the two objectives is determined using Pareto diagrams and examined for varying particulate conditions. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Retaining trees for conservation at final harvest is becoming increasingly common within forestry globally, especially connected to clearcutting. The main action is to leave single living and dead trees, tree patches and buffer strips, to benefit biodiversity and to enhance ecosystem functioning. We present the first national analysis of effects on structural components from applying the retention approach. In Sweden retention forestry has been practiced large-scale for about 25 years, prescribed by the law and a requirement in certification standards. By analyzing data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory we found that the volume of dead trees (>= 100 mm in diameter; single trees and trees in patches <0.02 ha; data for larger retention patches not available) in stands 0-10 years old increased about 70% during the period 1997-2007, with a current average level of 8 m(3) ha(-1), and with a larger increase rate in this age class than in other forest ages. Retained living trees (>= 150 mm in diameter; single trees and trees in patches <0.02 ha; data for larger retention patches not available) decreased in quantity from 1955 until the early 1980s, with lowest levels of about 5 ha(-1) (excluding Pinus sylvestris, commonly used as a seed tree) and then increased, approximately reaching the 1950s level by 2007, with about 15 trees ha(-1) on average. Large-scale application of the clearcutting practice is the probable cause of the decrease, whilst retention actions are the likely explanation for the increase during the last decades. Our study clearly shows that young forests have become structurally richer since the introduction of the retention approach in forestry. However, comparatively low amounts of dead wood in forests 0-10 years old compared to what is available in old forests imply loss at harvest and studies of possible mechanisms to explain this are needed. Our results can indicate possible changes in other parts of the world, where the retention approach has been introduced more recently. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ideals of productivist agriculture in the Western world have faded as the unintended consequences of intensive agriculture and pastoralism have contributed to rural decline and environmental problems. In Norway and Australia, there has been an increasing acceptance of the equal importance of social and environmental sustainability as well as economic sustainability. Alongside this shift is a belief that primary production needs to move away from kin intensive, productivist-based agriculture to one that may be defined as post-productivist. In this paper, we argue that the dualism of productivism and post-productivism as concepts on agricultural policy regimes are too simplistic and discuss whether multifunctional agriculture is a better concept for a comparison of rural primary production at two extreme points of the scale, the market-oriented, liberalistic Australian agriculture and the market-protected small-scale Norwegian agriculture. We argue that multifunctionality in Australia rates relatively weakly as an ideology or policy kind even less as a discourse or practice and hence is situated toward a 'weak' end of a continuum of a level of multifunctional agriculture. In Norwegian agriculture, multifunctional agriculture has thrived within a protectionist setting with the support of the public, the state and agricultural actors. In this sense it is very clearly a policy, practice kind discourse that aims to preserve and conserve rural spaces, the cultural landscape, the farming way of life and food safety. Norway is as such situated toward a 'strong' end of a continuum of a level of multifunctional agriculture. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species belonging to higher trophic levels are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and consequential host population declines, but detection of effects depends on observation scale. We investigated the effects of habitat and host availability at multiple scales on parasitoids of early successional saproxylic beetles in middle boreal Sweden, where forestry has led to habitat fragmentation and coarse woody debris (CWD) loss. Parasitoid wasps and beetle hosts were collected from nine locations, each containing three spruce-dominated stand types (clear-cut, mature managed and unmanaged stands), using emergence traps on experimental CWD. We measured local CWD volumes and determined the availability of forests of a suitable age within the landscape. We tested parasitoid responses to stand type, CWD volume, abundance of known and probable hosts and longitude. Additionally, we tested whether parasitoids responded to the area of habitat of a suitable age within radii from 0.2 to 10 km. Stand type appeared in best-fit models for all common species, suggesting that wasps respond strongly to habitat at local scales. Longitude (largely climate) featured commonly, but CWD volume was never significant. Host abundance appeared in best-fit models for three of five common species, proving significant only for Bracon obscurator, the abundance of which correlated with that of Orthotomicus laricis at both trap and site levels. Rhimphoctona spp. also correlated significantly with its known host Tetropium castaneum at the trap level. B. obscurator responded to habitat area at scales of 0.6-1 km and Cosmophorus regius responded at radii greater than 7 km, while the larger species did not respond strongly to habitat area. The role of habitat area at greater scales thus varied greatly amongst species, but our data suggest that dispersal of these common early successional species may not be strongly restricted at the current scale of fragmentation of their boreal habitats.

AB  - This essay discusses Johan Turi's images (most of them undated) and his text published in 1910, recently translated by Thomas A. DuBois as An Account of the Sami. It is the first book in Sami in which the colonized talks back to their colonizers. Together, Turi's Account and his paintings and drawings, some of which are published here for the first time, provide detailed descriptions of the lives of Sami herders in the mountain areas in northern Sweden, their seasonal migrations towards the coastal areas of northern Norway, and their knowledge, culture, and belief systems. Turi's main objective was to make the state administrations in Sweden and Norway understand Sami culture and put an end to their detrimental colonial practices so that the Sami could continue living in their traditional land. I compare his project to studies of the Sami performed by Swedish authors and scientists, whose views, despite their thorough investigations and "scientific" approaches, gave support to ongoing processes of Swedish/Norwegian colonization and assimilation of Sapmi, i.e. the Sami and their land. The imagery of Johan Turi adds to his text by demonstrating the hidden as well as the perceptible. As such, his artworks differ fundamentally from those of contemporaneous Swedish landscape painters. Turi's production insists on a holistic and relational acknowledgement of nature, animals, humans, and the spiritual. The need to understand, protect, live within, and respect their environment is fundamental for the Sami. Together, Turi's artworks and text constitute profound and well-founded arguments for the preservation of Sapmi, in ecological as well as human terms.

AB  - Austria and Sweden were both relatively unaffected by the economic crisis, challenges of the provision of welfare still exist, at least in peripheries. Economic downturn and outmigration have limited demands and increased the costs for services of general interest. This paper aims to discuss welfare policy and planning strategies for peripheries from a planning cultural sensitive perspective. It will answer how much the value of territorial cohesion is under pressure for peripheries in traditional welfare states, identifying a mismatch between policy levels. The results indicate a stepwise mainstreaming of competitiveness goals in favour of urban regions, leaving the challenges of peripheries to policy responses of single municipalities.

AB  - Giving industrial sites new life requires enabling change and overcoming change resistance. By cross-fertilizing relevant managerial and urban development literature, this study develops a theoretical and analytical framework that integrates several factors that can lead to the sustainable transformation of post-industrial sites. Case evidence collected using qualitative methods at the Great Copper Mountain WHS, Sweden, reveals a Managerial innovation model of industrial heritage regeneration which fails to fully engage the surrounding communities. This model is associated with early-stage post-industrial heritage tourism. The resistance, controversy and community misperceptions hindering the adaptive reuse of the site's industrial heritage and urban surrounds are mainly determined by institutional norms arising from the industrial monoculture. Change management entails working to dismantle lock-ins and empower change at different levels.

AB  - Habitat loss causes population declines, but the mechanisms are rarely known. In the European Boreal Zone, loss of old forest due to intensive forestry is suspected to cause declines in forest-dwelling raptors by reducing their breeding performance. We studied the boreal breeding habitat and habitat-associated breeding performance of the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus). We combined long-term Finnish bird-of-prey data with multi-source national forest inventory data at various distances (100-4000 m) around the hawk nests. We found that breeding success of the goshawk was best explained by the habitat within a 2000-m radius around the nests; breeding was more successful with increasing proportions of old spruce forest and water, and decreasing proportions of young thinning forest. None of the habitat variables affected significantly the breeding success of the common buzzard or the honey buzzard, or the brood size of any of the species. The amount of old spruce forest decreased both around goshawk and common buzzard nests and throughout southern Finland in 1992-2010. In contrast, the area of young forest increased in southern Finland but not around hawk nests. We emphasize the importance of studying habitats at several spatial and temporal scales to determine the relevant species-specific scale and to detect environmental changes. Further effort is needed to reconcile the socioeconomic and ecological functions of forests and habitat requirements of old forest specialists.

AB  - Background Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges cities worldwide face today. Planning healthy environments for all future populations, whilst considering the ongoing demand for urbanisation and provisions needed to combat climate change, remains a difficult task.
   Objective To combine artificial intelligence (AI), atmospheric and social sciences to provide urban planning solutions that optimise local air quality by applying novel methods and taking into consideration population structures and traffic flows.
   Methods We will use high-resolution spatial data and linked electronic population cohort for Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) to model (a) population dynamics and urban inequality related to air pollution; (b) detailed aerosol dynamics, aerosol and gas-phase chemistry together with detailed flow characteristics; (c) high-resolution traffic flow addressing dynamical changes at the city environment, such as accidents, construction work and unexpected congestion. Finally, we will fuse the information resulting from these models into an optimal city planning model balancing air quality, comfort, accessibility and travelling efficiency.

AB  - Social polarization in the urban landscape means that there are a lot of neighbourhoods with a concentration of residents suffering from high crime rates, a loss of feeling of safety, ethnic conflicts and general decay. Local and national governments respond to these challenges by adopting urban development programmes with a pronounced area-based orientation. Inspired by the global Healthy Cities Programme, some of these initiatives have an explicit public health-related focus. This article analyses the possibilities and obstacles for an initiative of this kind undertaken by four Swedish cities under the label Partnership for Sustainable Welfare Development. Sustainable development, healthy cities, neighbourhood and partnership are concepts rhetorically underpinning the policy intervention under study. After a brief, critical survey of these concepts the article presents the empirical study undertaken on the basis of interviews, official documents and participatory observation. Finally the results of this study are summarized and related to some of the literature in this field. It is found that the role of the partnership as a node for mutual learning and coordination is held in high esteem by the partnership participants. Other qualities given high priority by them are the need for comprehensive, long-term planning and residents' participation and influence. However, from a more distanced point of view it is also obvious that the approach has its limitations due to the fact that even successful interventions cannot affect the fundamental causes of urban social polarization as these causes relate to general socioeconomic cleavages in society.

AB  - Temporal and spatial vegetation structure has impact on biodiversity qualities. Yet, current schemes of biotope mapping do only to a limited extend incorporate these factors in the mapping. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of a modified biotope mapping scheme that includes temporal and spatial vegetation structure. A refined scheme was developed based on a biotope classification, and applied to a green structure system in Helsingborg city in southern Sweden. It includes four parameters of vegetation structure: continuity of forest cover, age of dominant trees, horizontal structure, and vertical structure. The major green structure sites were determined by interpretation of panchromatic aerial photographs assisted with a field survey. A set of biotope maps was constructed on the basis of each level of modified classification. An evaluation of the scheme included two aspects in particular: comparison of species richness between long-continuity and short-continuity forests based on identification of woodland continuity using ancient woodland indicators (AWI) species and related historical documents, and spatial distribution of animals in the green space in relation to vegetation structure. The results indicate that (1) the relationship between forest continuity: according to verification of historical documents, the richness of AWI species was higher in long-continuity forests; Simpson's diversity was significantly different between long-and short-continuity forests; the total species richness and Shannon's diversity were much higher in long-continuity forests shown a very significant difference. (2) The spatial vegetation structure and age of stands influence the richness and abundance of the avian fauna and rabbits, and distance to the nearest tree and shrub was a strong determinant of presence for these animal groups. It is concluded that continuity of forest cover, age of dominant trees, horizontal and vertical structures of vegetation should now be included in urban biotope classifications.

AB  - Sustainability is widely accepted as an important conceptual framework within which to position urban policy and development. Furthermore, urban planning is recognised as an important instrument for promoting sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to examine how Finnish central business district developments are designed to facilitate environmental sustainability. Three recent urban regeneration projects are explored as a multiple case study, firstly to model the central business district development process in Finland, and secondly to analyse how the expected outcomes of such regeneration projects support environmental sustainability. Official plan reports and supplementary case data are analysed qualitatively. A common development process model is identified and environmental sustainability is found to be promoted through higher urban density. However, environmental considerations are made only in the beginning and at the end of the linear planning process. In each of the cases studied, the contribution to environmental sustainability appears to be scarce. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nature-based tourism firms and other stakeholders often compete for the same resources. Knowledge of and access to resource bases are therefore essential for firms' success. Nature-based tourism firms operate in nature areas, which, for the Nordics, may include human-made objects and intangibles. In this study, we therefore adopt a broad approach towards the concept of natural resources and include human-made, social, and cultural resources, termed resources in nature. Based on 558 survey responses, we analyse the dependence on resources in nature for three types of nature-based tourism firms in Norway. Intangible resources, such as silence, views, and other sensory qualities, are generally the most essential resource group for the firms, together with special biotopes and unique and iconic landscapes and areas. Cultural resources are also of certain importance to the firms. This study contributes to knowledge-based management and the prioritization of resources essential for the nature-based tourism industry.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present the implementation cases of mobility as a service (MaaS) in Finland and Sweden, as well as in Poland. The first part of the article pertains to explain the concept of MaaS and determinants of development in urban transportation, including the complexity of the analysed problem, with particular emphasis on integration of various stakeholders. The second part presents connections between MaaS and the concept and goals of sustainable development. The authors of the paper are convinced that user-oriented and multimodal mobility services may prove an effective alternative (or complement) to private transportation. It may also promote a shift towards sustainable means of transport and more effective use of transportation networks. Therefore, MaaS is perceived as a tool for reducing congestion and negative environmental impacts. The MaaS concept can become a part of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP). The third part of the article is empirical and presents application of MaaS in sustainable urban mobility based on two European case studies: Helsinki and Stockholm - concerned as the leading cities in terms of MaaS implementation. The last part of the study is devoted to the analysis of the MaaS implementation level in Polish cities.

AB  - Deadwood is an important structural and functional component of forest ecosystems and biodiversity. As deadwood can make up large portions of the total aboveground biomass, it plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Nevertheless, in tropical ecosystems and especially in Africa, quantitative studies on this topic remain scarce. We conducted an aboveground deadwood inventory along two environmental gradients-elevation and land use- at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We used a huge elevation gradient (3690 m) along the southern slope of the mountain to investigate how deadwood is accumulated across different climate and vegetation zones. We also compared habitats that differed from natural forsts in land-use intensity and disturbance history to assess anthropogenic influence on deadwood accumulation. In our inventory we distinguished coarse woody debris (CWD) from fine woody debris (FWD). Furthermore, we calculated the C and nitrogen (N) content of deadwood and how the C/N ratio varied with decomposition stages and elevation. Total amounts of aboveground deadwood ranged from 0.07 +/- 0.04 to 73.78 +/- 36.26 Mg ha(-1) (Mean +/- 1 SE). Across the elevation gradient, total deadwood accumulation was highest at mid-elevations and reached a near-zero minimum at very low and very high altitudes. This unimodal pattern was mainly driven by the corresponding amount of live aboveground biomass and the combined effects of decomposer communities and climate. Land-use conversion from natural forests into traditional homegardens and commercial plantations, in addition to frequent burning, significantly reduced deadwood biomass, but not past selective logging after 30 years of recovery time. Furthermore, we found that deadwood C content increased with altitude. Our study shows that environmental gradients, especially temperature and precipitation, as well as different anthropogenic disturbances can have considerable effects on both the quantity and composition of deadwood in tropical forests.

AB  - Polypore communities were compared between mature managed, overmature managed, and old-growth spruce-dominated forests in southern Finland. A total of 85 polypore species, with 6000 records, were found in 16 sample plots, each 4 ha in size. Old-growth stands had on average 80% more species than mature stands, and 38% more species than overmature managed stands. Variation in polypore species richness was best explained by diversity of dead wood and the number and volume of dead trees. The best predictor for the number of threatened polypore species was the number of cut stumps. Threatened species were practically confined to old-growth forests and to stands in which the amount of dead wood exceeded 20 m(3)/ha. This figure appears to represent a stand-level threshold value for the amount of dead wood, below which the persistence of threatened species becomes unlikely. Our results suggest that a significant increase in the amount of dead wood (e.g. by leaving large retention trees and even by killing trees) is needed in managed forests before they become suitable habitats for threatened polypores.

AB  - The Swedish national research programme "Sustainable Urban Water Management" aims to analyse and assess the sustainability of urban water systems (UWS) covering a range of perspectives. This paper will concentrate on development of tools to assess organisational and household related aspects, being an area with a particular need of development. Incorporated in our definition of UWS, is the condition that the functioning within the system is critical for sustainability as such and three sub-systems are distinguished: households, organisation and technical structure. A point of departure is that functional fit between the sub-systems needs to be high in order to create sustainable UWS.
   Organisational capacity, adaptability, motivation, opportunity and ability are used as criteria for comparison of two different technical structures. We can conclude that no straight answer to the question which system to prefer emerge - which is most often the case in reality. The two systems are high on some sub-criteria and low on others. With a combination of internal systems analysis, like this, and impact assessments, it is possible to both increase the quality of the impact assessments and manage to make analysis of organisations and households within their own frames of logic.

AB  - Local agency is marked by its structural boundedness including nation state strategies. We investigate the dynamic and mutually constitutive interrelationship between agency and state strategies to better understand and explain change in local development with the examples of four mining towns: Kiruna (Sweden), Zeitz (Germany), Most (Czechia) and Tatabanya (Hungary). They embody processes of industrial transition and mining activities that are heavily regulated by (supra-) national authorities and marked by constantly changing multiscalar power relations. We find local agency is constrained by rather specific relations and can be facilitated by more complementary ones, both on local level and between different scales.

AB  - The recent debate on urban vibrancy and its associated spatial characteristics worldwide has increasingly attracted the attention of planners and decision-makers in Norway and the European Union seeking to develop compact cities. This study investigated the spatial pattern of urban vibrancy associated with urban form and the determinants in Oslo, Norway. A total of 552 km2 of the Oslo central metropolitan area was classified into 12 neighborhood groups and a data-driven methodology was applied via SPSS, Python, and ArcGIS to analyze urban vibrancy, where each cell was denoted as a 1 km2 area of 24 variables. As a result of clustering via principal component analysis, six principal components were extracted with 12 critical factors. Results indicated that the location and distribution of commercial buildings, public buildings, residential buildings, and companies and the total population are the most important drivers of neighborhood vibrancy in Oslo. Vibrant neighborhoods usually appear in high-density, central urban areas with a high concentration of commercial and public buildings with various functions along main streets. In contrast, less vibrant neighborhoods have fewer service facilities and are surrounded by single residential areas, large venues, green spaces, vacant land, or land for transportation in the low-density suburban and semi-urbanized areas. This research offers a quantitative basis for a wider range of neighborhood performance assessments, provides a discussion of compact city theory, and draws the attention of decision-makers on planning policy at the neighborhood level, which can also be adapted to other European cities.

AB  - There is a strong connection between people's knowledge of nature and their relationship to place. Local environmental knowledge is multifaceted and influenced by changing social and economic circumstances that affect the way people come to know and relate to nature. A case study from Finland demonstrates how locality, personhood, and environmental perceptions cohere to challenge conservation practices. In this instance, local people fully uphold the conservationists' desire to save a threatened endemic mammal, the Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis nordq), from extinction. However, local people are far less enthusiastic about the conservationists' chosen means for achieving conservation of the seal. They fail to engage with many aspects of the conservation program because its design and implementation fail to acknowledge local people's collective and personal experiences of place. The case study demonstrates the need for conservation programs to take seriously local people's "place-based" observations and theories.

AB  - Ruminant meat (beef and lamb) is recognised as the food with the largest environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet reducing meat consumption and production is controversial. Resistance to change has been linked to policy lock-ins and asymmetries in power favouring the agri-food industry. At the same time, agricultural policy has been described as moving towards a post-exceptional, less compartmentalized field where food production is balanced against issues like climate and animal welfare. In this article, we explore how the discourse on meat reduction and greenhouse gas emissions are related to various other agricultural policy issues, using Norway as a case. Investigating the stakeholder submissions to the Norwegian government's ambitious proposal to reduce meat consumption and production in Climate Cure 2030, we identify three storylines in the discursive landscape. The first storyline is 'It is time to increase production - not reduce it' which we see as an exceptionalist storyline where arguments for the unique position of the sector contributing to national goals of food security and value creation should prevail. Another dominant storyline is 'In our country, animal farming is sustainable', which has typical post-exceptionalist features where nonproducer concerns, such as biodiversity and cultural landscapes, are seen as a net positive result of the grazing animals in Norway. The third storyline 'The voices of consumers, animals and nature need to be included in policy networks' also has strong post-exceptionalist viewpoints, but it calls for a radical restructuring of the sector, therefore, we see this as a radical postexceptionalism. Our findings find little support for radical change, and for now, meat beats mitigation.

AB  - Fennoscandian conifer forests have experienced a major landscape transformation during the 1900s. Currently, only scattered patches of old semi-natural forests exist in eastern Finland. However, on the Russian side old and mature forests still cover large tracts. We aim to show how the proximity of protected areas to the Russian border affects their species assemblages. We also ask how well the multi-scoring procedure applied by governmental ministries to design reserve networks performs in terms of bird protection. Censuses were conducted in fifteen old-growth forest areas located at varying distances (0-120 km) from the Finnish-Russian border in 1997. Data were gathered on ten non-migratory species that are mostly associated with old-growth or mature forests, many of which show decreasing population trends in Finland during the 1900s. Both the total density and number of species decreased as distance from the Russian border increased. Of the individual species, the Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) showed the highest decrease in its relative population density. The Siberian Jay (Perisoreus infaustus) and the Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) occurred only in the areas closest to the Russian border. The number of species peaked close to the border: the average number of species in the standardized 50 ha area decreased from 5.0 to 2.0 as distance increased from 0-10 km to 80-120 km. The results support views of the negative impact of isolation on old-growth specialist bird species. However, the habitat quality within the remaining patches - such as the amount of coarse woody debris - may also affect local bird assemblages. The ranking procedure applied in the old-growth areas in Finland turned out to be non-informative for birds. The ranks were not related to the population densities or number of resident species.

AB  - Support to energy, particularly hydropower, has formed an important element of many donor programmes. How have such interventions shaped the emergence of particular energy imaginaries in the countries engaged with? 'Energy imaginaries' can be understood as the set of institutions, logics, values, and visions that spur ideas around what sources of energy and forms of energy governance best foster development. Adopting a historical and comparative perspective and drawing on the notion of 'transnational assemblages', we explore the nature of energy aid interventions and the dynamic shifts of specific actors and discourses in bilateral relations. We focus on Norway, a leading player in energy support, and two of its long-term partner countries, Nepal and Tanzania. Through document analysis and interviews with key actors, we trace how Norwegian energy transnational assemblages have formed part of evolving energy imaginaries in Nepal and Tanzania in radically diverging ways. In Nepal, dominated by an energy imaginary of hydropower as 'white gold', efforts to foster a bottom-up-driven indigent energy sector were eclipsed by an emphasis on facilitating privatisation, resulting in a chaotic fragmentation of the energy landscape. In Tanzania, the donor-state energy imaginaries were centred on grandiose projects of hydropowered industrialisation bound for failure, but later revived as part of an authoritarian project. The study untangles a history of changing and partially conflicting discourses, offering a richer and more nuanced understanding than studies focused on single projects or policies. We highlight how the idea of transnational assemblages can be useful in understanding shifting imaginaries of energy development.

AB  - Silage bailer technology preserving harvested grass and turning it into silage by a baling machine attached to a tractor is common in most rural regions in Norway. In this paper, we argue that not only have silage bales become a common sight in rural areas, in certain cases, silage bales have also had profound significance for agricultural development without much attention paid to their profound role and implications. Norway represents such a case, and a deeper understanding of how such a now common agriculture technology became established could shed light on how the introduction of new technologies affects agricultural change on societal and structural levels. This includes how technologies interact with societal and organizational aspects of agriculture - the co-production of technology and societal practices on different levels. How does new technologies connect - influence and become influenced by - socio-cultural farm practices and societal, organizational and structural features of Norwegian agriculture? We use the introduction of the silag round bale press in Norway as a case study to shed light on this implementation process and its significance for the Norwegian agricultural sector.

AB  - Political and legal conflicts between the need for targeted private forest conservation and the continued assurance of private property rights in the U.S. presents a seemingly intractable resource management problem. Scandinavian use of habitat protection areas on private forests offers an additional tool that may be suitable for solving the historical and on-going tension found within U.S. efforts to reconcile desires to maintain lands in a forested condition while also respecting private property rights. This article presents a comparative cross-sectional policy analysis of Sweden, Finland, and the U.S., supported with a supplemental case example from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Similarities in all three countries among forest ownership patterns, use of public subsidies, and changing attitudes towards conservation are generally encouraging. Additionally, Virginia's current consideration and development of state-wide forest policies focused on forestland and open space conservation suggests both a need and an opportunity to systematically assess the applicability of the Nordic forest reserve approach to local private forest conservation. Future research at a high-resolution, and specifically at the state level, should focus on the social and political factors that would ultimately determine the viability of a forest reserve program.

AB  - This paper analyzes strategies that can be successfully pursued to implement measures to reduce car traffic in what has traditionally been a very car-centric planning praxis. Analytically, the paper use path dependency theory to provide an understanding of why certain types of measure are not implemented in cities on as widespread a basis as policy objectives may require, and to understand how transport planning path dependence in urban authorities might be changed. Empirically, the analysis builds on a comparative case study of transport and land use planning in Swedish cities. The most effective strategies do not appear to be radical policies leading to fast implementation of goals about sustainable transport, for example by implementing very car restrictive measures, even in the face of resistance from the public and from within the city administration. The results support an approach that from a strategy making perspective can be understood as an institutionalizing process by which internal organizational and external public support for car restrictive and potentially controversial measures are built. Implementation may be achieved by building new institutions within city administrations, where routines and norms gradually change so that car restraint measures gradually become part of the normal way of doing transport planning. This then starts to lock-in certain patterns of travel and make further car restraint measures more feasible and institutionalized as part of a standard menu of measures that cities use, and not something out of the order.

AB  - Areas in central Norway were heavily contaminated with fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. In this study, we assess 137Cs in surface sediments and sediment cores collected in the Vefsnfjord in Nordland county. Concentrations of 137Cs in surface sediments ranged from 159 to 191 Bq kg-1 dry weight (d.w.). Sub-surface peaks of 137Cs were observed in all cores, with a maximum concentration of 432 Bq kg- 1 d.w. Given that little is known about the distribution of naturally occurring radionuclides in Norwegian fjords and coastal areas, a better understanding of the total burden of radioactivity is important for the Norwegian fishing and aquaculture industries. Therefore, analyses of the natural radionuclides 40K, 226Ra, 228Ra and 210Pb were included in the study. Analyses of total sulphur (TS), total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and grain size distribution have been performed to provide a sedimentologic context for interpreting the radionuclide results.

AB  - The continued decline of natural forests globally has increased interest in the potential of planted forests to support biodiversity. Here, we examine the potential conservation benefits of plantation forests from an Irish perspective, a country where remaining natural forests are fragmented and degraded, and the majority of the forest area is comprised of non-native Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) plantations. We examine the true value of Irish plantation forests to native biodiversity, relative to remaining natural forest fragments, and to prior and alternative land use to afforestation. We find that plantation forests provide a suitable surrogate habitat primarily for generalist species, as well as providing habitat for certain species of conservation concern. However, we find that plantation forests provide poor habitat for native forest specialists, and examine potential management strategies which may be employed to improve habitat provision services for this group.

AB  - Increasing numbers of previously threatened large grazing birds (cranes, geese and swans) are causing crop damage along their flyways worldwide. For example, the number of reported incidents of crop damage caused by common cranes Grus grus, followed by regulated inspections and governmental compensation in Sweden, has increased over the last few decades and was valued at similar to 200,000 Euros in 2012. Consequently, their impact on agriculture is escalating which raises the need for evidence informed preventative strategies. We surveyed arable fields for autumn staging common cranes in an area surrounding a wetland reserve in Sweden. We assessed the following factors in relation to the probability of cranes being present on fields: crop stage, crop type, distance to roost site, time of day, field size and time since harvest. Stubble fields had the highest probability of crane presence, progressively decreasing through grassland and grazing grounds, bare soil to growing crop. A stubble field at 5 km from a roost site had a predicted probability (95% CI) of hosting cranes of 0.25 (0.19-0.32). The probability of cranes visiting a field was linearly and negatively related to distance to the roost site. For example, the probability of crane presence increased from 0.05 (0.03-0.07) to 0.09 (0.06-0.15) when distance decreased from 5 to 1 km. At stubble fields, the probability of crane presence decreased with time since harvest and was highest for barley with progressively lower probability on wheat and oat. Illustrative scenario predictions developed from the models demonstrated that probability of crane presence could be high, 0.60 (0.42-0.77), if all favorable factors were combined (e.g. barley stubble, 1 day after harvest, 1 km from roost site). Given the existing framework of international conventions and prohibition of culling, there is a need for preventative strategies to reduce crop damage. Based on our results, such strategies should focus on providing cereal stubbles as diversionary fields, especially close to wetland roosting sites. Stubble field availability can be achieved by careful crop rotation planning. We suggest that crop rotation and time of harvest should be added to flyway management plans recently developed for some large grazing bird species to facilitate stable co-existence between conservation practices and agricultural interests.

AB  - Forest management alters species behaviours, distributions and interactions. To evaluate forestry effects on ant foraging performance, we compared the quality and quantity of honeydew harvested by ants among clear-cuts, middle-aged and mature spruce-dominated stands in boreal forests in Sweden. Honeydew quality was examined using honeydew collected by squeezing the gasters of laden Formica aquilonia workers. We used fifteen laden individuals at each study site (four replicates of each stand age) and analysed honeydew chemical composition with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. To compare the quantity of honeydew collected by individual ants, we collected and weighed five ants moving up and five ants moving down each of ten trees at the twelve sites (totally 1200 ants). The concentration of trehalose in honeydew was lower in clear-cuts compared with middle aged and mature stands, and similar trends were shown for sucrose, raffinose and melezitose, indicating poorer honeydew quality on clear cuts. Concentrations of the amino acid serine were higher on clear-cuts. The same trend occurred for glutamine, suggesting that increased N-uptake by the trees after clear cutting is reflected in the honeydew of aphids. Ants in mature stands had larger heads and carried proportionally more honeydew and may therefore be more efficient foragers. Human alternation of habitats through clear-cutting thus affects food quality and worker condition in F. aquilonia. This is the first study to show that honeydew quality is affected by anthropogenic disturbances, likely contributing to the reduction in size and abundance of F. aquilonia workers and mounds after clear cutting.

AB  - Investments toward a carbon-neutral forest industry will change forestry and wood procurement in Northern Finland. The changing market situation requires data-driven DSSs for the strategic management of logistics. Using this software, logistics were described by a continuing wood flow model and optimized by a dynamic method. Three logistics scenarios described wood flows in the present and in the future. The optimization minimized the economic and environmental costs, which decreased by 4.9%. However, synchronized multimodal transportation costs increased by 23.3%. Therefore, maximum logistics efficiency necessitates increases in railway transport capacity. The change would also decrease CO2 emission costs. Under scenario-specific circumstances, logistics operations could be focused on four profitable regions, increasing market shares at municipalities. To guarantee environmental sustainability of these municipalities, optimization of timber markets between forest owners and forest industry must be developed further by driving data from the EU's emission allowance price compensation mechanism to the optimization process.

AB  - The concepts of Multiple-use forestry and preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests are elements of an ongoing debate in Norway, regarding aesthetical and biological consequences of current forest management practices. A study, based on the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), was performed during the fall of 1990. Data were collected through in-person interviews of 1204 persons above 15 years of age.
   The main objectives of the study were to analyze: 1) Attitudes toward the present state of Norwegian forests, 2) Attitudes toward and maximum willingness to pay for changes in current forest management, 3) Preferences and maximum willingness to pay for preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests, and 4) Attitudes toward society's right to impose restrictions on forest management on private forest land.
   Based on responses to statements related to the forest area people usually visit, the study showed a low degree of conflict regarding the present state of Norwegian forests. A ranking of possible results of two alternative forest management strategies, i.e. 1) a more cautious forest management or 2) preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests, gave the highest average scores to ''Preservation of endangered plants and animals'' and ''Preservation of ''virgin'' forests for our descendants'', both related to the second management strategy. The maximum willingness to pay for a more cautious forest management was 277 Norwegian kroner (NOK) per household and year, with a median value of NOK 50. 47% of the sample preferred the preservation alternative A specified by the governmental committee, Barskogutvalget, while 18% preferred alternative B and 9% preferred alternative C, corresponding to the governmental decision. 15% preferred a 0-alternative, i.e. no further preservation of ''virgin'' coniferous forests. Two possible sources of bias, related to the CVM, were tested.

AB  - Spitsbergen as part of the Arctic is the focus of attention for many actors in the geopolitical arena. In the 19th century the use of the archipelago for peaceful economic and scientific purposes was the main condition for international cooperation which was then encapsulated by the Spitsbergen Treaty in 1920 in Paris. The USSR joined the treaty fifteen years later. The paper emphasises that the Russian presence in Spitsbergen is preconditioned not only by economic benefits gained from ongoing coal mining, fishing, and tourism but also by strategic considerations as well as the prospect of discovering new minerals, especially rare earth metals. In order to develop theoretical, methodological and practical recommendations concerning the problems of the Russian presence on Spitsbergen, the article analyses Russian-Norwegian relations in the context of determining the status and economic activity on the archipelago. The paper explores the state policy of modern Russia over the last 30 years, reveals the nature and algorithm for resolving the conflict in summer 2022 caused by the sanctions of the European Union on the delivery of cargo for the Arktikugol trust. Growing militarisation of Norway and tightened requirements of Norwegian legislation concerning the use of a special zone around the Svalbard archipelago increase military tension in the European continent. Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO membership is a direct way to undermine the existing peace, stability, and atmosphere of interaction in the region and threaten Russia's national security. As a practical solution, the authors conclude that it is necessary to conduct consultations on the understanding and interpretation of the provisions of the Spitsbergen Treaty with its signatories, taking into account current international realities.

AB  - The paper sketches the state of grouse science as reflected by the 8th International Grouse Symposium held at Rovaniemi, Finland, in September 1999, by contrasting the representation of species, topics and trends in the literature and at the Symposium. The analysis was based on 5,349 grouse papers published between 1930 and 1998 and 75 abstracts submitted for the Symposium. In the past, grouse research has focused on the species with the greatest economic and cultural importance. During the 1990s, population dynamics, habitat and behaviour have become the major research topics. At the Symposium, a number of trends became apparent: increasing importance of genetic and landscape ecological studies, integration of disciplines, approaches and explanations, as well as increasing cooperation. However, a significant gap seems to exist in the documentation and communication of experience in grouse conservation and management.

AB  - To avoid conflicts often associated with mandatory regulations, it Is crucial to motivate and incentivize forest owners to participate in voluntary conservation programs. To investigate forest owner preferences and willingness to accept compensation (WTA) to participate, we conduct a contingent valuation survey of non-industrial private forest owners in Norway. We find that WTA is negatively related to the size of the forest holding and absentee ownership. and positively related to the share of the forest classified as productive. The overall mean WTA per year per hectare is estimated at NOK 1800. Costs of reaching conservation goals can be saved by targeting small and relatively less productive forests and absentee owners first, before considering increasingly expensive forest areas. However, this recommendation only holds if desirable biological characteristics are not substantially less likely to be found in such areas. Results are potentially important both for our understanding of forest owner preferences and the costs of voluntary forest conservation schemes currently in use in many countries.

AB  - Esker aquifers are common groundwater bodies in Europe. Management of these aquifers should take account of the sustainability of groundwater-dependent ecosystems and land use in an integrated way. An unconfined esker aquifer in northern Finland was modelled with MODFLOW to determine how groundwater resources are impacted by the surrounding peatland drainage scheme and to simulate scenarios for possible drainage restoration. The impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change were also simulated. A calibration-constrained Monte Carlo method was used to provide information on the uncertainties associated with model predictions. The results suggest that peatland drainage in the vicinity of eskers can have a significant role in lowering the water table, even though climate variability may mask these impacts. Drainage restoration by filling the ditches might have positive impacts on the aquifer water levels. Comparison of water-table changes caused by peatland drainage with the changes brought by water abstraction and climate variability helped to quantify impacts of different land-use scenarios and facilitated discussion with the local stakeholders. Based on this study, more attention should be devoted to peatland drainage schemes in integrated groundwater management of esker aquifers.

AB  - Background Allergic diseases are more common in Finland than in Estonia, which-according to the biodiversity hypothesis-could relate to differences in early microbial exposures. Methods We aimed at defining possible microbial perturbations preceding early atopic sensitization. Stool, nasal and skin samples of 6-month-old DIABIMMUNE study participants with HLA susceptibility to type 1 diabetes were collected. We compared microbiotas of sensitized (determined by specific IgE results at 18 months of age) and unsensitized Estonian and Finnish children. Results Sensitization was differentially targeted between populations, as egg-specific and birch pollen-specific IgE was more common in Finland. Microbial diversity and community composition also differed; the genusAcinetobacterwas more abundant in Estonian skin and nasal samples. Particularly, the strain-level profile ofAcinetobacter lwoffiiwas more diverse in Estonian samples. Early microbiota was not generally associated with later sensitization. Microbial composition tended to differ between children with or without IgE-related sensitization, but only in Finland. While land-use pattern (ie green areas vs. urban landscapes around the children's homes) was not associated with microbiota as a whole, it associated with the composition of the genusAcinetobacter. Breastfeeding affected gut microbial composition and seemed to protect from sensitization. Conclusions In accordance with the biodiversity hypothesis, our results support disparate early exposure to environmental microbes between Finnish and Estonian children and suggest a significant role of the genusAcinetobacterin the allergy gap between the two populations. The significance of the observed differences for later allergic sensitization remains open.

The economic and environmental impacts of this mine became a key focus of Finnish politics during 2010-12. Its performance has sparked a heated discussion about the legitimacy of the mining industry and its place in Finnish society. The paper analyses the Talvivaara crisis as a process, which began as a local environmental conflict but would become a symbol of national conflict in the mining industry. The policy analysis presented here is informed by Pondy's Model of Organisational Conflict. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes - the '3Q programme'. The main objective of the scheme is to indicate development trends in the agricultural landscape, and their consequences for spatial structure, biodiversity, cultural heritage and accessibility. The monitoring programme alms to give policy feedback and provide data to fulfil international reporting requirements. This paper describes the background to the programme and reasons behind the choice of methods. Results are presented to show the accuracy of the methods employed and the range of indicator values recorded in the programme. Strengths and limitations of the monitoring programme are discussed, and potential future improvements and developments are outlined. Although there remains a potential for methodological improvement, we stress the importance of establishing a baseline to enable the detection of development trends in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - This paper presents the preferences of residents towards green areas and, in particular, for agricultural environments in Vantaa City, southern Finland. The study area includes three growing suburbs and farming land immediately adjacent to the city centre. During the study period, new residential areas in the fringe area, combined with a simultaneous build-up of the road network, resulted in fragmentation and increased land use diversity. We found that the farming land at the fringe of the city had a greater recreational role than its basic function linked to either food or fodder production. Visual mapping of pleasant places proved the importance of public traditional farms and that preserved nature areas were preferred more than constructed parks for residents living in the urban fringe. This suggests that an emphasis in careful urban land use policy might be placed more upon the maintenance of natural areas that remain unchanged.

AB  - This study identifies some mechanisms through which external factors constrain state behavior. Examining Norwegian governance for the disputed Svalbard offshore area, it finds the behavior of Norway to be constrained in multiple ways by the conflicting policies of foreign powers toward the area. When shaping the management regime of the controversial maritime zones of the former terra nullius Svalbard, Norwegian authorities cautiously consider the possible international ramifications of their actions. Norway's behavior-not only manifested in policy but also in the exercise of contested legislative and enforcement jurisdiction-is curbed amid international disagreements over Norwegian rights in the area.

AB  - The effects of land use on external P load (L-P), critical P load (L-C) and on L-P/L-C of 27 lakes in Finland were examined with regression analyses. Catchment area to lake area ratio (A(C)/A(L)), cultivated catchment area to lake area ratio (A(F)/A(L)) and the percentage of cultivated land in the catchment (F-%) were used as independent variables. We studied whether these parameters can be used to estimate the risk of exceeding the critical P load (L-P/L-C > 1). All three parameters had a positive effect on L-P and L-P/L-C. Compared with A(C)/A(L) and F-%, A(F)/A(L) had a higher coefficient of determination in predicting L-P and L-P/L-C. This was because A(C)/A(L) does not include land use variations in catchments and F-% does not include information on catchment size, while A(F)/A(L) includes information on both. Critical P load was exceeded when A(F)/A(L) > 1.63. A(F)/A(L) can be a useful and simple tool for evaluating the risk of lake eutrophication.

AB  - Forestry is one of Europe's largest land uses, for which adaptation to climate change will require coordinated action among multiple actors. However, so far, adaptation has been less placed in focus than has mitigation, and adaptation in the forest sector has mainly been reactive. This paper explores and reviews the integration of forestry in the development of planned adaptation policy in different countries. Sweden, Germany and France are taken as examples of countries with different developments of their adaptation policies as well as different requirements of their forest systems and actors. Italy is utilised as an example of how adaptation actions for forestry have been defined in a country where no national adaptation policy currently exists; in general, the results illustrate the seemingly large role of extreme events in driving adaptation policy forward in different policy systems.

AB  - Elements of the landscape, such as patches of preferred habitat, matrix between patches, and corridors linking patches, differ as movement habitat for animals. To understand how landscape structure influences the movement and thus, population dynamics of animals, clear empirical knowledge on patterns of movement is needed. The Siberian flying squirrel inhabits spruce-dominated boreal forests from Finland to eastern Siberia. Numbers of flying squirrels have declined severely in Finland in past decades, probably due to modern forestry. We studied the movement of radio-collared adult flying squirrels in preferred (spruce forest) and in matrix habitat (open areas and other habitats with trees) in Finland 1997-2000, and determined whether the woodland strips connecting patches of preferred habitat could function as ecological corridors for flying squirrels.
   Flying squirrels used woodland strips for inter-patch movements, but also used matrix with trees and were able to cross narrow open gaps. Males moved longer total distances and crossed edges more often than females. Males used matrix habitats for movement between spruce patches, and moved faster and more directly in the matrix than in the spruce forest. Females seldom changed spruce patches, but instead used the matrix for foraging. For both sexes probability of leaving the spruce forest patch correlated negatively with the size of the patch, but the type of connection the patch had to other patches did not affect the leaving probability. Due to efficient movement abilities of the flying squirrel and forest-dominated landscape structure of southern Finland, we suggest that conservation acts for maintaining viable populations of flying squirrels should focus on the quality of managed forest and the area of suitable breeding habitat (i.e. on habitat loss), but not necessarily on ecological corridors.

AB  - Animal agriculture is shifting toward larger farms and regional agglomerations in many countries. In step with this development, manure nutrients have started accumulating regionally, and are leading to increasing eutrophication problems. Nevertheless, the same trend may also prompt innovations in manure treatment. For example, Valio Ltd (the largest dairy processer in Finland) is planning a network of facilities that would remove water from manure, fraction the nutrients in it, and produce biogas from the excess methane. One of the main hurdles in developing this technology is that the current regulatory framework does not support a shift from diffuse loading, which is seen in the traditional application of manure on fields, to point-source loading; the regulations may even prevent such a change. This article analyzes a governance framework that addresses this dilemma in EU-Finland, and discusses how the governance described could curtail the nutrient loading of agriculture to waters. The approach is based on adaptive governance theory. We argue that traditional top-down regulation, which emphasizes food security, contains serious shortcomings when it comes to managing agricultural nutrient loading to waters, and that the current regulatory framework does not necessarily have the adaptive capacity to facilitate new, bottom-up solutions for manure treatment. Interestingly, the strict water quality requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) open new windows of opportunity for such solutions, and thus for improving the overall sustainability of animal agriculture.

AB  - Most conservation conflicts have "material cores" in the sense that interests tied to economically motivated landscape transformation are pitted against conservation. These aspects of the conflict resemble issues that are regularly handled within established political and bureaucratic contexts, such as those regulating the interaction between the state and the agricultural sector. Mitigation efforts normally target such conflict issues, which can apparently be addressed by means of economic compensation or incentives. However, many controversies have additional aspects that are fundamental to conflict development. These are rooted in social tensions and processes of social change that may have less to do with conservation per se. Therefore, mitigation efforts that address economic loss may lead to unintended consequences, in that they aggravate other aspects of the conflicts. Norwegian wolf management is a prime example, as conflict mitigation is almost entirely directed at livestock producers-even in areas with little livestock.

AB  - The remains of the Atlantic Wall installations (bunkers) of WWII which extend all along the western coasts of Europe (of France, of the British Channel Islands. Belgium, Holland, Germany, Denmark and Norway), presents a subject worthy of research. From a cultural heritage and urban planning standpoint, the question of the reuse and best possible rendering-exploitation-reuse of this European modem day equivalent of the Great China Wall. This research interest can be attributed amongst others to its uncommon, unconventional utilitarian character, and to the trans-European historical identity which involves a shared cultural heritage as well as to the size and architectural nature of this most extensive cross-border linear building form. Apart from reference being made to historical elements describing the various phases of planning, construction and use and the role that it played during the war period, the article exposes the choice of not destroying but of maintaining-rebuilding and preserving of sections of the Atlantic Wall by the responsible institutions of the interested European states, leading to its final transformation of uses and operation today. Finally, case studies are presented from a number of European countries, with focus on the type of intervention, in the urban re-planning and in the local, territorial-urban transformations of coastal departments of cities today, which render new cultural poles of built-up, urban and tourist attraction and recreation.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise has been recognized as a source of concern since the beginning of the 1940s and is receiving increasingly more attention. While international focus has been on the effects of noise on marine mammals, Norway has managed seismic surveys based on the potential impact on fish stocks and fisheries since the late 1980s. Norway is, therefore, one of very few countries that took fish into account at this early stage. Until 1996, spawning grounds and spawning migration, as well as areas with drifting eggs and larvae were recommended as closed for seismic surveys. Later results showed that the effects of seismic surveys on early fish development stages were negligible at the population level, resulting in the opening of areas with drifting eggs and larvae for seismic surveys. Spawning grounds, as well as concentrated migration towards these, are still closed to seismic surveys, but the refinement of areas and periods have improved over the years. Since 2018, marine mammals have been included in the advice to management. The Norwegian case provides a clear example of evidence-based management. Here, we examine how scientific advancements informed the development of Norwegian management and how management questions were incorporated into new research projects in Norway.

AB  - The recent dramatic decline in farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural changes in the agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming is viewed as a more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European agri-environment schemes. However, the efficiency of agri-environment schemes to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes.
   We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity).
   Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes.
   An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable land (yield of spring barley, kg ha(-1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas.
   Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based agri-environment schemes to increase the amount of organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic agri-environment schemes.

AB  - In the face of climate change and habitat fragmentation there is an increasingly urgent need to learn more about factors that influence species distribution patterns and levels of environmental tolerance. Particular insights can be obtained by looking at the edges of a species range, especially from species with wide distributions. The European roe deer was chosen as a model species due to its widespread distribution. By using pellet group counts, we studied summer and winter habitat use of this herbivore at two of the extreme edges of its distribution - southwest of Portugal, and northeast of Norway - in relation to a range of fine-scale environmental factors including forest structure, vegetation characteristics and human disturbance. Our first prediction that roe deer would respond differently to human activity in both counties was supported. While in Norway roe deer are always close to houses, in Portugal they are either far (in summer) or indifferent (winter). However, everywhere and in every season, roe deer are far from roads. Our second prediction that roe deer better tolerate anthropogenic disturbances in the area where the importance of limiting factors is higher (Norway) was validated. However, our third prediction that anthropogenic disturbance would be less tolerated by roe deer outside the limiting seasons in each. country was not supported. Our results suggest that roe deer perceive human activities differently in the two countries and that roe deer better tolerate anthropogenic disturbances in Norway.

How have such interventions shaped the emergence of particular energy imaginaries in the countries engaged with? 'Energy imaginaries' can be understood as the set of institutions, logics, values, and visions that spur ideas around what sources of energy and forms of energy governance best foster development. Adopting a historical and comparative perspective and drawing on the notion of 'transnational assemblages', we explore the nature of energy aid interventions and the dynamic shifts of specific actors and discourses in bilateral relations. We focus on Norway, a leading player in energy support, and two of its long-term partner countries, Nepal and Tanzania. Through document analysis and interviews with key actors, we trace how Norwegian energy transnational assemblages have formed part of evolving energy imaginaries in Nepal and Tanzania in radically diverging ways. In Nepal, dominated by an energy imaginary of hydropower as 'white gold', efforts to foster a bottom-up-driven indigent energy sector were eclipsed by an emphasis on facilitating privatisation, resulting in a chaotic fragmentation of the energy landscape. In Tanzania, the donor-state energy imaginaries were centred on grandiose projects of hydropowered industrialisation bound for failure, but later revived as part of an authoritarian project. The study untangles a history of changing and partially conflicting discourses, offering a richer and more nuanced understanding than studies focused on single projects or policies. We highlight how the idea of transnational assemblages can be useful in understanding shifting imaginaries of energy development.

AB  - Rural communities are changing. Depopulation and unemployment is accompanied by the advance of new perspectives on nature, where protection trumps resource extraction. These developments are perceived as threatening by rural working-class people with close ties to traditional land use - a situation they often meet with cultural resistance. Cultural resistance is not necessarily launched against institutionalized power, nor does it necessarily imply a desire for fundamental social change. It should rather be seen as a struggle for autonomy. However, autonomy does not entail influence outside the cultural realm. Struggles to uphold traditional rural lifestyles - for example by denouncing the current nature conservation regime - could be understood in much the same conceptual framework as Willis employed in 'Learning to labour'. Based on an ethnographic study of the conflicts over wolf protection, we demonstrate that 'the Hammertown mechanism' is of a more general nature than often implied in the discussion of Willis' work.

AB  - The Finnish Forest Act was revised in 2010-2013. The need for revision emerged from societal changes manifested through the changing objectives of private forest owners, increasing and diversifying demands for forest goods and services and increasing number of stakeholders, as well as the changes in the forest sector operational environment that relate to the globalisation of markets and influences of international policies. Advocacy Coalition Framework guided this study to identify and describe the belief structures and coordination of advocacy coalitions in the Finnish forest sector in the context of the revision of the Forest Act. Three coalitions were identified on the basis of policy core beliefs and coordination between actors: Forestry coalition and Administrative coalition derive their normative beliefs from the forest paradigm, whereas Environmental coalition derives its beliefs from the environmental paradigm. The differences deriving from the two different paradigms have led to polarised coordination patterns between rival coalitions, minimal communication channels between opponents and a long-term disagreement about major questions in the subsystem. Interestingly, the government seems to have a divided representation in forest policy, since Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Environment contribute via different coalitions. In the future, the success of Finnish forest sector depends on how well it is able to combine different preconditions deriving from these two paradigms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With a fast rise in large-scale wind power development in Sweden and other countries in recent years, issues related to energy justice generally and distributional justice specifically have become concerns in windmill siting. Some research, for instance, has indicated that it is easier to build windmills in economically marginalized communities. The evidence for this, however, is still limited. Thus, this study aims to statistically evaluate the extent to which the decisions to approve or reject windmill proposals in Sweden can be explained by factors related to the socio-economic characteristics of people living in the areas surrounding windmill sites. The study is based on an odds ratio analysis of decisions on all windmill proposals in Sweden, in which geo-referenced socio-economic data on an individual level for all inhabitants within 3 and 10 km of the windmill sites are studied. The results show skewness in the distribution of windmills, with a higher likelihood of rejection in areas with more highly educated people and people working in the private sector, compared to a higher likelihood of approval in areas with more unemployed people. Thin skewness, while not necessarily unjust, warrants further policy and research attention to distributional justice issues when developing wind power.

AB  - This study provides insights into social media practices and strategic considerations used by destination management organizations (DMOs). It examines a theoretical model of generic social media strategies for destination management and applies qualitative methods to analyze the social media initiatives of DMOs of Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden and the Scandinavian Tourist Board Asia/Pacific in the Nordic European Region. The study provides empirical evidence of emerging social media strategies among DMOs and confirms the growing importance of these new media. The findings point to the conflicting relationship between corporate culture and social media culture, the challenges innovative communication tools present for traditional management structures, poor levels of formalization and the lack of a knowledge base which results in ad-hoc decision making. Overall, the paper discusses the challenges faced by DMOs in their adoption of new technological cultures.

AB  - This paper compares the performance of five modelling methods in the prediction of a species distribution, using a data set describing the distribution of the threatened clouded apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne) in south-west Finland. The five statistical techniques included were: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). The accuracy of the models was examined at three spatial resolutions (1, 25 and 100 ha) by area under the curve (AUC) and kappa statistics. All five modelling techniques had a relatively high discrimination capacity for the occurrence of clouded apollo. Classification tree analysis provided the least robust model performance. The differences between the other methods were small, although GAM and MARS provided marginally the best stability and performance. The most accurate models were developed for the resolutions of I ha (highest AUC values)and 25 ha (highest kappa values) and the least accurate models for the resolution of 100 ha. Our work shows that modern modelling techniques can provide useful forecasts of species distributions in unsurveyed parts of landscapes and provide valuable contributions to conservation and management planning. However, the success of applying the new modelling tools can be influenced by the choice of statistical technique and especially of spatial resolution. In conclusion, small changes in the spatial scale may result in a clear decrease in the model performance and thus caution should be exercised when implementing the models and their predictions in practice.

AB  - The abundance and distribution of corvids (Common Raven, Corvus corax; Hooded Crow, C. corone; Jackdaw, C. monedula; Black-billed Magpie, Pica pica; and European Jay, Garrulus glandarius) were studied across a gradient from a landscape dominated by agricultural land to a landscape dominated by forest in south-central Sweden. The total density and the predation rate on dummy nests increased as the proportion of agricultural land increased. This supports the suggestion that the density of corvids increases as forest becomes fragmented and intermixed with agricultural land, causing an increase in nest predation in small forest fragments. However, the different species responded differently to the proportion of forest in the landscape.
   The two forest-living corvids, the Jay and Raven, were absent from small forest fragments in a matrix of agricultural land and mainly preyed upon dummy nests inside the large forest fragments. Thus, both of these species were habitat specialists restricted to forests. Three corvids basically inhabit agricultural land, the Hooded Crow, Jackdaw, and Magpie. The Jackdaw and the Magpie showed a strong preference for agricultural land and they mainly preyed upon dummy nests in agricultural land. On the other hand, the density of Hooded Crows was higher in landscapes with a mixture of agricultural land and forest than in landscapes dominated by either agricultural land or forest, indicating a use of both agricultural land and forest. Further, Hooded Crows regularly preyed upon nests in both forest habitat and agricultural land; it is a habitat generalist. Therefore, the Hooded Crow was the most important species in the corvid family, causing increased predation pressure close to forest-farmland edges and in small forest fragments surrounded by agricultural land.

AB  - The article examines the role of public participation rights in the Finnish forest planning system and considers the need for improvement, with a particular focus on private forests. Public participation is approached here as one of the tools for achieving social and ecological sustainability in forestry. The paper shows that public participation rights are very limited in the forest planning and management schemes in Finland. Among other things, access to environmental information is restricted, which is exceptional in modern environmental and natural resource law. The article concludes that there is a need to strengthen the participatory elements in forest planning if the aim is to improve environmental and social sustainability in forestry.

TI  - The protection of movable cultural property in wartime: Pre-conflict planning in Sweden
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL PROPERTY
LA  - English
AB  - Modern warfare has prompted states to protect collections of cultural property by evacuating them to safe locations at times of war. Building on previously classified documents in archives, inquiries and other sources, this article investigates how planning for such evacuation was carried out in Sweden from 1939 to the 1990s. After the end of the Cold War, existing evacuation plans were finally scrapped. Due to the worsening security situation in the region, Swedish heritage institutions today need to build preparedness anew. It is shown that the evacuation of large volumes of property out of cities for practical reasons never was a realistic scenario, but probably should be restricted to a minimum of carefully selected objects, records and books. The process of selecting, transporting, finding safe locations to take the property to, and determining how to monitor it needs to be carefully planned during peaceful conditions in order to efficiently safeguard the collections in wartime. The relationship between Swedish planning and the 1954 Hague Convention, and how other states can learn from this study, is finally discussed.

AB  - Capture and long-distance translocation of cleaner fish to control lice infestations on marine salmonid farms has the potential to influence wild populations via overexploitation in source regions, and introgression in recipient regions. Knowledge of population genetic structure is therefore required. We studied the genetic structure of ballan wrasse, a phenotypically diverse and extensively used cleaner fish, from 18 locations in Norway and Sweden, and from Galicia, Spain, using 82 SNP markers. We detected two very distinct genetic groups in Scandinavia, northwestern and southeastern. These groups were split by a stretch of sandy beaches in southwest Norway, representing a habitat discontinuity for this rocky shore-associated benthic egg-laying species. Wrasse from Galicia were highly differentiated from all Scandinavian locations, but more similar to northwestern than southeastern locations. Distinct genetic differences were observed between sympatric spotty and plain phenotypes in Galicia, but not in Scandinavia. The mechanisms underlying the geographic patterns between phenotypes are discussed, but not identified. We conclude that extensive aquaculture-mediated translocation of ballan wrasse from Sweden and southern Norway to western and middle Norway has the potential to mix genetically distinct populations. These results question the sustainability of the current cleaner fish practice.

AB  - The Oslo Airport at Fornebu was closed in 1998 after 60 years of operation. An area of 3.1 km(2) was made available for one of Norway's biggest property development projects. Plans include 6000 residences and 20,000 workplaces. Fomebu is situated on a peninsula in the Oslo Fjord just outside the city of Oslo and is regarded as a very attractive area for both urbanisation and recreation. The residential area located centrally at Fomebu surrounds a centrally located park area. In the planning process, there was an expressed interest in using water as a life-giving element within the vegetation structure of the park. In Norway, stormwater in urban areas has traditionally been collected and transported in pipe systems to adjacent watercourses. However, there is an increasing interest in alternative "green" solutions for the management of stormwater. The paper presents a concept for sustainable stormwater management at Fomebu. A main objective is to improve the recreational and ecological value of stormwater while achieving a cost-effective solution. This objective is reached by replacing conventional urban drainage pipes with swales, filter strips, wetlands and ponds as collection, storage and treatment systems designed for natural processes. The paper thereby addresses integrated systems for stormwater management by approaching nature's way and sustainable development principles. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to KASSA findings, conservation agriculture is less adopted in Europe compared to other adopting regions and, reduced tillage is more common than no-tillage and cover crops. Currently, it is not popularised and it is less researched. The lack of knowledge on conservation agriculture systems and their management and, the absence of dynamic and effective innovation systems make it difficult and socio-economically risky for European farmers to give up ploughing which is a paradigm rooted in their cultural backgrounds. In Norway and Germany the adoption of conservation agriculture has been encouraged and subsidised in order to mitigate soil erosion. In the other European countries the adoption process seems mainly driven by farmers and, the major driving force has been the cost reduction in machinery, fuel and labour saving. Soil and water conservation concerns did not appear as main drivers in the European farmers' decision to shift or not to conservation agriculture.
   The shift of European farmers to conservation agriculture is being achieved through a step-by-step attitude, large scale farms are the most adopters. This adoption trend may grow in the future. Indeed, the need to improve farms' competitiveness. the market globalization and the steady increase of fuel cost will likely contribute to arouse European farmers' interest in conservation agriculture as it slashes significantly the production costs.
   Conservation agriculture is not equally suitable for all the European agroecosystems. The need of soil and water conservation in Europe requires anticipating the ongoing process in order to improve its ecological and socio-economic sustainability. Priority would be to define which regions in Europe are the most suitable for conservation agriculture taking into account climate and soil constraints, length of growing period, water availability and quality, erosion hazards and farming conditions. Policy favouring the use of soil cover and profitable crop rotations as management strategies for weed, pest and diseases control will certainly allow developing and disseminating efficient and acceptable conservation agriculture systems.

AB  - We examined the breeding success of forest grouse in relation to anthropogenic forest fragmentation in Finland. Employing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and grouse data derived from Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1989-1994, we combined the locations of 2267 Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and 1060 Capercaillie (T. urogallus) females after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data. The indicators of breeding success were the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and brood size. Two study areas teach 45 000 km(2)) in the boreal zone were selected for investigation.
   The breeding success of grouse was negatively correlated with both fragmentation of forest area per se by farmland and the: decreasing proportion of older forest as a result of clear-cutting. The extent of landscape accounting best for variation in nesting success was an order of magnitude larger (similar to 100 km(2)) than the area most probably used by a grouse female and her brood during the summer, which suggests that landscape scale factors may override local factors such as track size and distance from edge. The proportion of grouse hens with a brood was lower in heavily fragmented landscapes than in more continuous forest landscapes whereas only minor differences in brood size were detected. We suggest that the most likely cause of the observed spatial correlation was higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes. The effects of landscape composition on the breeding success of grouse were more marked in northern than in southern Finland, probably because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. The diminished breeding success of forest grouse as a result of increased forest fragmentation is a probable cause of population declines in forest grouse species during the past decades in Fennoscandia.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper we present a case study where the Swedish planning support system Citylab is applied to a Chinese case in Changzhou's Tianning District. Design/methodology/approach China's planning system is a vertical system based on policy development on the national level, policies which are to be implemented on local level. There is a gap between the ambitious central policies and the implementations on local levels. China is now exporting its planning model to other developing countries which makes it urgent to show examples of other strategies including more horizontal planning involving the public. The planning system in Sweden is based on a much more horizontal process. Therefore, the authors try to learn from Sweden's vertical planning system in the urban development environment of China. Findings A key message for policy makers in China is that systems like Citylab can play an important role in developing practical and scalable examples of more sustainable city districts. The paper concludes that a barrier for local sustainability planning in China is still lack of effective communication between local actors including the public. Originality/value The authors exemplified Changzhou Tianning District's practical exploration, thus proving the adapted Citylab method's practical operability. Based on the common problems faced by eco-city development in developing countries, the method framework of Citylab is applicable to other developing countries, with strong room for deduction and development.

AB  - Climate change and biodiversity loss are often seen as the two most serious environmental threats facing humanity. It also seems to be a common notion that concerns about these issues are embedded in the same package of environmental concern among the public. In this article, we probe the relationship between dimensions of concern about environmental challenges. In a general population survey in Norway, respondents were asked how concerned they were about several environmental issues. Factor analysis revealed that concern about climate change and concern about major causes of biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction, loaded on different factors. When respondents ranked the three issues they were most concerned about, there was minimal overlap between climate change and biodiversity loss. It appears that relatively distinct profiles exist, based on different interpretations of current environmental challenges. The profiles are differently related to background factors such as social class, education and gender. These relationships are not strong, but the association between confidence in various institutional actors and the concern profiles is quite distinct, and different for the two. Further research is needed to properly elucidate drivers behind the different orientations.

AB  - To determine the importance of field boundary habitats for farmland biodiversity, we surveyed a total of 193 boundaries from four climatically and agriculturally dissimilar regions in Finland. We measured the current plant species richness and composition of the boundaries, and, based on the differences in vegetation characteristics, we describe six boundary types.
   The observed plant species were mainly indicators of fresh to wet soils and moderate to rich mineral nitrogen content. The most frequent species were tall, perennial monocots and dicots indicating the high productivity of the vegetation. Moreover, herbicide-tolerant species were common. No species rare for Finland were found. In animal husbandry regions, the most frequent species were sown grassland species and typical grassland weeds. In cereal production regions, fast-spreading root weeds tolerant of herbicides were the most frequent. Mean species richness was highest in the cluster Calamagrostis-Phalaris (24 species (s) / boundary (b)), which we considered as representative of moist sites with some disturbance by agricultural practices. Most species-poor were the clusters Elymus-Anthriscus (14 s/b) and Elymus-Cirsium (16 s/b), both found predominantly in cereal production regions in southern Finland.
   Our results suggest that the biodiversity value of boundaries is lowest in the most intensive cereal production areas and highest in areas of mixed farming.

AB  - The coastal heath region along the western coast of Norway, dominated by Calluna vulgaris, is undergoing rapid change. Vegetation changes are caused by changes in management, including reduced frequency or abandonment of periodic heath burning and reduced cutting and grazing. The islands of Froan, in the outermost part of SOr-TrOndelag County in mid-western Norway, are dominated by coastal heath in a state of recession due to reduced traditional land use. The coastal heath is acknowledged as vulnerable and valuable by national environmental authorities, and local landscape management is supported by different national subsidies. The authors mapped the vegetation on Froan and used rule-based GIS-modelling to predict the relative potential for future vegetation changes. The model was based on a range of map layers, including management themes such as history of heath burning and peat removal, current practices of sheep grazing, and also themes derived from the vegetation map, such as soil nutrients, soil moisture and present management status. The resulting model output provides relative probabilities of future changes under different land-use scenarios, and highlights where management efforts should be focused in order to maintain the traditional landscape character.

AB  - The Brazilian Forest Code has been in existence more than 80 years but has largely been ineffective in reducing deforestation in the Amazon due to a lack of adherence and enforcement. Recent revisions to the law reduced the restoration requirements for Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserve (LR) and established new tools to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation and strengthen the supervision and monitoring of protected areas. The goal of these changes is to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation, and strengthen the monitoring of protected areas. This paper investigates the probability that a household in Rondonia, Brazil will set aside land for permanent preservation and, once this decision is made, the extent of restoration. Our results suggest that-even in a region that is heavily deforested and under conditions of weak enforcement-households are complying with the law by developing formal plans for restoration. Most important, we find that access to extension agents, existing APP guidelines, and other policy levers (such as environmental licensing) have made a significant impact on the development of these plans suggesting that the 2012 Forest Code has the potential to impact future land restoration decisions.

AB  - Fjordic systems in temperate and Arctic regions often feature extensive kelp forests at their shallow coastal margins as well as extensive terrestrial forests. Detrital export from these shallow-water and terrestrial ecosystems is an important source of carbon for deep-sea communities in the form of kelp and wood falls. Benthic landers with experimental substrates (wood blocks and kelp parcels) were deployed for 10 mo at a depth of 530 m in a deep Norwegian fjord to investigate and compare macro- and megabenthic community structure, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning on kelp and wood falls. Results revealed that while wood and kelp falls can support a similar number of species and abundance of fauna, they support significantly different faunal communities. Biomass and secondary production on both wood and kelp substrates were significantly greater than in the control samples. Secondary production estimates were similar or higher than those reported from soft-sediment ecosystems at shallower European marine sites. Biological trait analysis showed that macrofaunal assemblages were distinct between the kelp and wood, providing evidence for differences in ecosystem function between the substrates. This case study from a deep-sea fjord in Norway provides clear evidence that while wood and kelp organic falls can support similar abundances of fauna, the associated benthic biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functioning can be dramatically different between these substrates. The work presented here aims to provide information that is useful in assessing the extent of anthropogenic impacts on deep fjord ecosystems with respect to informing future conservation and management strategies.

Samples were collected from 9-11 sample plots in each case using 10 window-flight traps in each stand. These yielded a total of 43,289 beetles and 553 species of which 232 were associated with dead wood. The species richness of these saproxylic species was significantly higher in old-growth forests than in managed forests, and had very significant positive correlations with most dead-wood variables. Seventy eight percent of the saproxylic species were more abundant in old-growth than in mature managed forests, and their assemblages in managed and old-growth forests were distinctive with almost no overlap. On the other hand, species richness and assemblages of non-saproxylic species did not differ between the managed and old-growth forests. Obviously these species do not require as much attention as saproxylic species when conservation measures are planned in managed forests. An increase in the general level of decaying wood would improve the situation of many declining saproxylic species. Although the species richness of Coleoptera as a whole was higher in overmature than in mature managed stands, the Value of long-rotation stands in preserving species assemblages typical of old-growth forests may be limited.

AB  - This study aims at elucidating modern pollen spectra/environmental data relationships from both natural and human-induced vegetation types as an aid for palaeo-ecological reconstructions. A set of 51 surface moss polsters was sampled from different vegetation and land-use types in the Champsaur area (French Alps) and analysed to obtain modern pollen analogues of ancient cultural landscapes in mountain ecosystems. Samples were selected from grazed areas, mown meadows, cultivated fields, fallow land and deciduous and coniferous forests. Vegetation composition around the sampling points and seventeen types of environmental variables (e.g., management type, soil and topography) were collected all for these 51 sites. Patterns of modern local pollen variation in relation to the environmental variables were explored by means of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and associated statistical tests. This correlative model allows us to determine the major explanatory variables and to identify taxa indicative of particular anthropogenic activities, and thus may help to calibrate fossil pollen assemblages.
   The indicator pollen types are evaluated in the light of comparable material from lowland and mid-elevation areas of western Europe. The results of the French data-set confirm some of the conclusions drawn from the North European data-sets, but also show some site specific features. Pollen markers with a broader global significance common to other regions include Rhinanthus type, Apiaceae and Dipsacaceae for mown meadows, Urtica type, Plantago media/major, Trifolium type and Potentilla type for grazed areas, and Cerealia type, Centaurea cyanus, and Polygonum aviculare for cultivated fields. New pollen anthropogenic indicators typical of our study area are Sanguisorba officinalis, Vicia type (mowing), Lotus type, Onobrychis type, Centaurea nigra type, Serratula type (grazing), Sinapis type and Papaver rhoeas (cultivation). This study provides potentially valuable analogues for human-induced vegetation types, and it may then become possible to interpret more objectively local pollen diagrams from Alpine mountain environments in terms of past cultural landscape development.

AB  - National forest programme (NFP) is a comprehensive national level forest governance model and overarching strategy to guide forestry development towards sustainability. Focusing on Finnish NFPs this study aimed to uncover the possible sifts in the national level forestry development priorities between late 1990's and the present. Following Carol Bacchi's policy analysis framework that focuses on problematisations, the study concentrated on the framing of the societal problems or situations that the NFPs were aimed to address, the underlying presuppositions and the proposed solutions. The problematisations in the Finnish NFPs have mainly focused on economic sustainability, especially increasing the use of wood, profitability and competitiveness of forest-based industries and expanding and diversifying forest-based business and entrepreneurship. Issues related to ecological and social sustainability have been included, but have generally remained secondary concerns.

AB  - After success in the Thirty Years' War, elites in Sweden realized that the nation had to establish a new economic base to support its newfound geopolitical prominence. Drawing on the Pan-European natural-knowledge-based political economy, Swedish reformers developed a version uniquely applicable to the nation's challenges and opportunities. At the center of this new political economy was the use of scientific knowledge to transform nature into usable wealth. Whether physics, alchemy, mechanics, or botany, any form of knowledge with the power to transform nature through mining, agriculture, or manufacturing was considered valuable. Drawing on either Paracelsian spiritual ideas or those of Cartesian materialism, Swedish improvement thinkers sought to penetrate deep into the inner life of nature and thereby unlock the storehouse of wealth that God had placed therein. This article traces how Johan Risingh, Urban Hiarne, Christopher Polhem, and Carl Linnaeus, in conversation with foreign improvers, combined knowledge of the natural world with commercial considerations to form a discourse they hoped would enable Sweden to embark on a trajectory of economic growth and thereby restore its mythical glory as the cradle of European civilization.

AB  - The quest for sustainable urban development requires innovative planning approaches more apt to cater for transformative action. Based on a case study approach, this study aims to explore the potential for local planning to develop practical approaches able to accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban development. To guide spatial development towards sustainability, the analysis of the results shows that local planners need to envision a process design as to advance the understanding of how a site or area can be developed. The act of process design involves pending between processes of contextualization (i.e. exploring five distinguishable domains of planning inquiry) and concretization (i.e. deciding upon a course of action by executing activities that form a process trajectory). Regarding the potential of local planning to develop transformative approaches, it is concluded that: (i) local planners possess capabilities that allow them to probe the future of places and produce insights about prospective change, (ii) the transformative capacity of local planning practices is bound to the development of the identified domains of planning inquiry and (iii) forthcoming evaluations organized around the act of process design can reveal insights regarding the possibilities to put the notion of sustainability into practice at the local level.

AB  - The value of accumulated ecological knowledge, termed ecoliteracy, is vital to both human and ecosystem health. Maintenance of this knowledge is essential for continued support of local conservation efforts and the capacity of communities to self- or co-manage their local resources sustainably. Most previous studies have been qualitative and small scale, documenting ecoliteracy in geographically isolated locations. In this study, we take a different approach, focusing on (1) the primary factors affecting individual levels of ecoliteracy, (2) whether these factors shift with economic development, and (3) if different knowledge protection strategies are required for the future. We compared non-resource-dependent communities in the United Kingdom with resource-dependent communities in India and Indonesia (n = 1250 interviews). We found that UK residents with the highest levels of ecoliteracy visited the countryside frequently, lived and grew up in rural areas, and acquired their knowledge from informal word-of-mouth sources, such as parents and friends, rather than television and schooling. The ecoliteracy of resource-dependent community members, however, varied with wealth status and gender. The least wealthy families depended most on local resources for their livelihoods and had the highest levels of ecoliteracy. Gender roles affected both the level and content of an individual's ecoliteracy. The importance of reciprocal oral transfer of this knowledge in addition to direct experience to the maintenance of ecoliteracy was apparent at all sites. Lessons learned may contribute to new local resource management strategies for combined ecoliteracy conservation. Without novel policies, local community management capacity is likely to be depleted in the future.

AB  - Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (1998-2015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory (1983-2014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35 million ha. Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4%. In parallel, several forest structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased, with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 1998-2015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate. But given their STI, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently.

AB  - Abstract
   Over the past two decades, rural tourism has increasingly been seen as a competitive advantage for the Norwegian tourism industry. The rural tourism sector was, by the turn of the millennium, characterised by tougher market environments, a demand for more coordinated and improved quality products, strong competition, ageing infrastructures, and unfulfilled expectations. The research reported here investigates Norwegian farm tourism operators and discusses their strategies in product development, the challenges, and the solutions. Based on a number of in-depth interviews with tourist enterprises in two Norwegian rural areas, the authors argue that Norwegian farm tourism is, in many ways, in line with the foreseen development. The strategies of the Norwegian farm tourism operators are: varied products, cooperation, and personal presence. Their motives are both market oriented and based on farm resources and household concerns, but when the chosen strategies lead to conflicts between two concerns, the household concern dominates.

AB  - Large carnivores are prioritized in conservation, but their co-occurrence with humans and domestic animals can generate conflict. Interventions preventing carnivore attacks are central to carnivore conservation, but are only effective if implemented. This study investigates drivers of the intention to use interventions among animal owners in Sweden based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, extended with the emotion construct Worry. Additionally, the study includes an explorative analysis investigating the processes behind this worry based on the Appraisal Theory of Emotion. In a survey comprising 1,163 animal owners, the subjective norm is identified as an important driver in the regression model of intended intervention use. Adding Worry to the model increased the amount of explained variance. Worry, in turn was mainly explained by experienced vulnerability among animal owners. This study illustrates how emotion theory can extend TPB to enhance understanding of human behavior, important for future coexistence between humans and wildlife.

AB  - Termination of fire along with active removal of deciduous trees in favor of conifers together with anthropogenic transformation of productive forest into agricultural land, have transformed northern European coniferous forests and reduced their deciduous component. Locally, however, in the villages, deciduous trees and stands were maintained, and have more recently regenerated on abandoned agricultural land. We hypothesize that the present distribution of the deciduous component is related to the village infield/out-field zonation in different regions, which emerges from physical conditions and recent economic development expressed as land-use change. We analyzed the spatial distribution of deciduous stands in in-field and out-field zones of villages in 6 boreal/herniboreal Swedish regions (Norrbotten, Angermanland, Jamtland, Dalarna Bergslagen, Smaland). In each region 6 individual quadrates 5 x 5 km centered on village areas were selected. We found significant regional differences in the deciduous component (DEC) in different village zones. At the scale of villages Angermanland had the highest mean proportion of DEC (17%) and Jamtland the lowest (2%). However, the amounts of the DEC varied systematically in in-field and out-field zones. DEC was highest in the in-field in the south (Smaland), but generally low further north. By contrast, the amount of DEC in the out-field was highest in the north. The relative amount of DEC in the forest edge peaked in landscapes with the strongest decline in active agriculture (Angermanland, Dalarna, Bergslagen) Because former and present local villages are vital for biodiversity linked to the deciduous component, our results indicate a need for integrated management of deciduous forest within entire landscapes. This study shows that simplified satellite data are useful for estimating the spatial distribution of deciduous trees and stands at the landscape scale. However, for detailed studies better thematic resolution is needed to determine biologically relevant differences in quality of deciduous stands.

AB  - This study investigated the occurrence of 25 forest bird species in relation to stand and landscape habitat composition in managed boreal forests in central Sweden. The number of species in 10 km transects was positively correlated to the proportions of forest > 40 yrs and Mixed forest > 40 yrs, as well as the number of fragments of the latter, while negatively correlated to the proportions of clear-cuts and young forest. Transects with > 60% older forest including > 6% mixed habitats showed the highest number of bird species and individuals. The positive effect on species numbers of mixed forest was stronger in the study area where deciduous rich habitats were generally less abundant. Bird species richness in points of similar habitat was negatively correlated to the degree of fragmentation of the surrounding older forest. However, in a species-by-species analysis at the transect level no effects of fragmentation were found. The number of bird species at points was positively influenced by the increase from 0 to 5% deciduous trees, while no effect of higher deciduous site proportions showed. The hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) appeared as a significant indicator of high bird diversity at the transect ( landscape) level, by all methods used. However, the conclusion was reached that forests where the hazel grouse, blue tit (Parus caeruleus), treecreeper (Certia familiaris), jay (Garrulus glandarius) and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) are present are most likely to hold the potential for high bird species richness.

AB  - Regeneration of natural forest structures and dead wood has a key role in the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in most parts of the boreal zone. In order to obtain benchmarks for practical dead wood management rapidly, we utilised unintended historical experiments in land use by studying the recovery of forests surrounding abandoned villages along 2.5-km transects in NW Russia. The signs of past human forest use declined as a function of distance from villages. We found that the closest forests were 130 yr old or younger and contained very few elements typical of natural forests. Forests at a distance of between 1 and 1.5 km were older than 150 yr but showed marks of selective cuttings and had a less complete continuum of dead wood than forests that were 2-2.5 km from the villages. The most remote stands, which were generally older than 200 yr, predominantly had no signs of past forest use and had the most diverse dead wood composition. Our study shows that full recovery of the dead wood continuum in middle boreal forests is a slow process and also that less intensive past forest use can have a significant effect on the dead wood continuum.

AB  - Climate-change projections suggest large changes in riverine flow regime, which will likely alter riparian communities. In northern Europe, forecasts propose lower annual spring flood peaks and higher winter flows, resulting in narrower riparian zones. To estimate the impact of climate change on habitat extent of riparian plants, we developed a framework estimating the sensitivity and exposure of individual species to streamflow change, and surveyed five reaches along the free-flowing Vindel River in northern Sweden. We modeled the hydrologic niche of riparian plant species based on the probability of occurrence along gradients of flood frequency and duration and used predicted future water-level fluctuations (based on climate models and IPCC emission scenarios) to calculate changes in flow-related habitat availability of individual species. Despite projected increases in runoff, we predict most species to decrease in riparian elevational extent by on average 12-29% until the end of the century, depending on scenario. Species growing in the upper, spring-flood-controlled part of the riparian zone will likely lose most habitat, with the largest reductions in species with narrow ranges of inundation duration tolerance (decreases of up to 54%). In contrast, the elevational extent of most amphibious species is predicted to increase, but conditions creating isoetid vegetation will become rarer or disappear: isoetid vegetation is presently found in areas where ice formed in the fall settles on the riverbank during the winter as water levels subside. Higher winter flows will make these conditions rare. We argue that our framework is useful to project the effects of hydrologic change caused by climate change as well as other stressors such as flow regulation also in other regions. With few rivers remaining unaffected by dams and other human stressors, these results call for monitoring to detect species declines. Management to alleviate species losses might include mitigation of habitat degradation from land-use activities, more environmentally friendly flow schemes, and more intensive management options such as mowing riparian meadows no longer regularly maintained by recurrent floods.

AB  - Sustainability assessment (SA) is a holistic and long-range strategic instrument capable of assisting policy-making in electing, and deciding upon, future development priorities. The outcomes of an SA process become more relevant and strengthened when conducted with multi-stakeholder engagement, which provides for multiple dialogues and perspectives. This was the object of research of the SA team in the context of BioScene (Scenarios for Reconciling Biodiversity Conservation with Declining Agriculture Use in Mountain Areas in Europe), a three-year project (2002-2005) funded by the European Union 5th Framework Program, which aimed to investigate the implications of agricultural restructuring and decline for biodiversity conservation in the mountain areas of Europe, using three distinct methodological streams: the ecological, the socio-economic, and the SA approaches. The SA approach drew on the previous two to assess the importance for biodiversity management of different scenarios of agri-environmental change and rural policy in six countries (France, Greece, Norway, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), develop causal chains, include stakeholder views, and identify potential contributions for, or conflicts with, sustainability. This article tells how SA was used, what sustainability meant in each study area through different objectives of sustainability considered, discusses the methods used in SA, and the benefits arising. The SA was conducted by a team independent of any study area, who developed and oversaw the application of the SA methodology, assisting national teams, and developing a cross-country understanding of the sustainability of proposed scenarios in the different geographical and social contexts, and their implications for policy-making. Finally, it reflects on the persistent challenges of interdisciplinary research, compounded by multi-cultural teams, and concludes on the BioScene's lessons for the further development and application of SA.

AB  - The HYPE model is a hydrological model for small-scale and large-scale assessments of water resources and water quality, developed at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute during 2005-2007. In the model, the landscape is divided into classes according to soil type, land use and altitude. In agricultural lands the soil is divided into three layers, each with individual computations of soil wetness and nutrient processes. The model simulates water flow and transport and turnover of nitrogen and phosphorus. Nutrients follow the same pathways as water in the model: surface runoff, macropore flow, tile drainage and outflow from individual soil layers. Rivers and lakes are described separately with routines for turnover of nutrients in each environment. Model parameters are global, or coupled to soil type or land use. The model was evaluated both by local calibrations to internal variables from different test basins and to data on discharge and nutrients from a large number of small basins. In addition, the estimated parameters were transferred to two larger basins in southern Sweden: River Ronnea and River Vindan. The resulting simulations were generally in good agreement with observations.

AB  - This article examines the Norwegian climate fiction television series Okkupert [Occupied] (2015-), focusing on the ways in which it reveals the complicity of Nordic subjects in an ecological dystopia. I argue that in illuminating this complicity, the series reimagines the Norwegian national self-conception rooted in a discourse of Norway's exceptionalist relation to nature. I show how Norway's green (self-)image is expressed through what I call "white ecology" - an aesthetics of whiteness encoded in neoromantic mountainous winter landscapes widely associated with the North, but also in the figure of the Norwegian white male polar explorer. I argue in this article that Occupied challenges this white-ecological masculine discourse through "dark ecology" (Morton, 2007), embodied by Russia and expressed by the avoidance of spectacular landscape aesthetics as well as by the strategy of "enmeshment", facilitated by the medium of televisual long-form storytelling and the eco-noir aesthetics.

AB  - Tourism in the Arctic is increasing rapidly and affecting local communities through land development pressures. In addition to providing economic opportunities, this development trend is affecting more intangible areas of life such as place attachment. The aim of this paper is to examine place attachment in tourism-dependent communities in the Arctic through place dependence and place identity. This is done through mapping sites with personal meanings and locally valued tourist sites in two communities in Finnish Lapland. The attachment is expressed in two different ways: currently, the economic activities are manifested almost exclusively through tourism development in Kilpisjarvi and Saariselka, of which the most important sites are located in the natural landscape. As a result, the communities' dependency on the natural surroundings is evident. The attachment also occurs through non-economic activities and is present through consumption-related actions, (e. g. fishing) as well as through less tangible issues, such as connecting with nature. The economic and consumption-related activities link with place dependence, whereas the more intangible factors with place identity. Mapping and calendar exercises helped to identify where the intensities of place attachment are located, and how they vary in space and time. Whilst considering place attachment and future tourism development, this paper also draws attention to changes in the local environment as a result of human activity, which may be amplified by climate change. When considering future tourism (or any) development, place attachment should carry a larger role in community and development planning.

AB  - Greenways have recently been established in some intensively farmed areas of South Sweden in order to enhance recreation opportunities and biodiversity, but the effects of these green structures on biodiversity have not yet been determined. In this study, greenways and experimental sown wildflower strips were investigated for butterfly and bumblebee diversity. In total, 1,769 butterflies of 18 species and 1,216 foraging bumblebees of eight species were recorded. Sown wildflower strips proved to support much higher abundances and species numbers of butterflies and bumblebees than greenways, with 86% of all butterflies and 83% of all bumblebees being observed in the sown flower strips. However, in both types of green structure mostly common species were found. Counts of flower visits showed that Knautia, Centaurea and Cirsium were the most commonly visited plant species. The greenways studied did not seem to fulfil their function of enhancing biodiversity-at least not for butterflies and bumblebees. However, these greenways could easily be improved for common bumblebee and butterfly species by sowing wildflower strips along their margins.

AB  - Macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis were used to study the disturbance history and development of a boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karat.) forest landscape in southeastern Norway. The sites studied were natural forests and the charcoal records showed no evidence of fire disturbance that could have broken the continuity in the spruce forests that were established ca. 1700 years ago. Consequently, true spruce forest ecosystem continuity was documented on a landscape level. However, fire disturbed the mixed pine-deciduous forest ecosystems that preceded the present spruce forests, suggesting a shift from fire-prone, to fire-free forest ecosystems.
   It is argued that the studied forest landscape has the potential to be an important natural reference for future forestry, that would be required to mimic natural forest dynamics to be biologically sustainable. A stereotypic promiscuous use of fire in the regeneration phase may cause serious damages in forest ecosystems that have developed without the impact of fire disturbance.

AB  - The objective of the paper is to explore whether particular problematisations of cars and car use lead to sets of solutions that may not deal with all problems associated with car use, and whether this leads to any internal conflicts within the chosen policies. The paper is based on a review of local transport policy documents from 13 cities in four countries using the lens of policy problematisation as an analytical framework. Some critiques of policy problematisation are discussed in the paper but it is nonetheless shown to be helpful for this analysis. The paper finds that the problems most typically highlighted in the strategies reviewed are poor accessibility (as a "bad" in itself, but also because it is seen to compromise economic growth); the negative impacts of traffic on liveability of the central part of the city and therefore its ability to attract inhabitants, especially those needed to support a knowledge economy; local air and noise pollution; and road safety. The resulting visions are for urban areas less dominated by private cars, with more green and public space, in order to maximise accessibility and liveability to attract economic development; and most cities also seek to reduce car travel as a proportion of trips. However, in many cities this vision covers mainly the central city, with car use set to remain dominant in outer cities and for regional trips. In almost all cities, only one measure, parking management, is proposed as a means of cutting car use. The differing sets of measures envisaged for outer areas of cities threatens to undermine those envisaged for more central cities.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the recent history of Finnish forest policy from the perspective of competing forest discourses. The data consist of 164 randomly selected forest-related articles from five Finnish magazines and newspapers published in 1977, 1997, and 2017. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative multivariate methods (NMDS) were combined in our mixed-method critical discourse analysis.
   Four forest discourses were identified. The hegemonic, utilitarian wood production discourse emphasised effective wood production and use, but also included nature conservation as an explicit objective for forest use by the 1990's. This turn into the multi-objective forestry paradigm was an initial victory for the subordinate, counteracting pro-nature discourse, but the wood production discourse quickly turned the paradigm into its own benefit. Despite this, the pro nature expanded its prominence in between the 1990's and the 2010's. The hegemonic recreation discourse, which arose in between the 1970's and the 1990's, emphasised positive experiences in the forest and was compatible with both the wood production discourse and the pro nature discourse. The small, hegemonic non-timber forest products discourse existed consistently through the study period.
   Within the wood production discourse, the present paradigm of multi-objective forestry creates an illusion that sustainability issues are in control, and the positive narration on nature produced by the recreation discourse supports this illusion. At the same time, the pro nature discourse expands its prominence in the Finnish society, deepening the cleavage between those who advocate the wood production discourse and the others. The great future challenge for both the pro nature and wood production discourse - and for the Finnish forest policy in general - is to think how to break these discoursal hinders for the sustainable development.

AB  - The internationalization of the forestry debate and forest policy brings about a growing need to develop, apply, and discuss comparative methodologies in forestry research, This paper illustrates and discusses the use of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a new comparative tool in forest policy research. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are demonstrated by reanalyzing previous research on public environmental criticism of forestry in Finland, Sweden, Norway, West Germany, France, and the United States between 1950 and 1983. In particular, the reanalysis illustrates the potential benefits of systematic techniques of comparison as supplementary tools to traditional "common sense" interpretations of qualitative data. In addition to arguing on behalf of the technical applicability of the method to comparative forest policy research, a need is expressed to expand the use of the method from causal to noncausal applications.

AB  - Body size descriptors and associated resemblance measurements may provide useful tools for forecasting ecological responses to increasing anthropogenic land-use disturbances. Yet, the influences of agriculture and urbanisation on the size structure of biotic assemblages have seldom been investigated in running waters. Using a comprehensive dataset on stream macroinvertebrates from 21 river basins across Western Finland, we assessed whether the structure of assemblages via changes in taxonomic composition and body size distributions responded predictably to anthropogenic land-use impacts. Specifically, we applied a combination of resemblance measurements based on cumulative abundance profiles and spatially constrained null models to understand faunal impairment by agricultural and urban development, and the most likely mechanisms underlying the observed shifts in assemblage size structure. Anthropogenically impacted stream sites showed less variation in assemblage composition and size distributions compared with least-disturbed sites, with strong declines in internal variation also occurring for the transition from near-pristine to moderately impacted landscapes. These results were consistent whether based on species-level or genus-level data. Variation in assemblage size structure seemed to be more predictable than taxonomic composition, supporting the notion that resemblance measurements based on body size distributions can represent an improvement to more traditional approaches based on taxonomic identities alone. In addition, we showed that macroinvertebrate assemblages resulted from effects of land-use degradation mediated through local conditions and spurious spatial structures in the distribution of anthropogenic activities across the landscape. Overall, our findings suggest that existing water policies and agri-environment schemes should be guided not only by understanding the individual effects of agricultural and urban development on taxonomic composition at a given stream site. Rather, we should also acknowledge the size structure of stream assemblages and whether concomitant changes in local conditions and the non-random distribution of human infrastructures are likely to mitigate or accelerate these effects.

AB  - A cultural turn in the economy has led to growth in what might be called 'spiritual entrepreneurship'.(1) This term refers to entrepreneurs inspired by a New Age philosophy marketing spiritual values such as 'self-development', 'holism' and 'deep values'. To shed light on this type of enterprise, the article examines one of its practitioners; Esther Utsi at Polmakmoen Guesthouse in northern Norway. My focus is on how New Age spirituality is here localized, wrapped in local indigenous culture and landscape, and turned into a commodity with market value for both tourists and conference participants. The staging of spirituality simultaneously involves marketing a vacation destination to outsiders, and is also linked to the formation of a reimagined local identity, and incorporated into the redefinition of images and dreams about the northern region.

AB  - Attitudes towards wolf policy are likely to be driven by perceived differences in political power between urban and rural groups. Using Swedish survey data collected in 2014 and structural equation modeling, I evaluated the effects of political alienation. Political alienation mediated the effect of having an urban or rural place of residence on attitudes towards wolf policy. Politically alienated individuals also preferred more extreme policy options than other respondents, while being less likely to approve of the current wolf policy in Sweden. These findings suggest that political alienation drives attitude polarization in wolf related social conflicts. Awareness of these underlying power asymmetries could possibly increase both policy legitimacy and management efficiency. This highlights the importance of accounting for social context in relation to policy-making and conservation efforts related to wolves.

AB  - The effects of ditching of boreal forest land on stream-water quality and quantity was assessed by comparing, over a 4-year-period, the physicochemical properties of the water in two small streams (western Finland), one whose catchment was ditched for forestry halfway through the sampling period and another nearby (control) stream whose catchment was not ditched ('paired catchment method'). While the artificial drainage did not have any significant effect on the hydrograph, it resulted in an increase in the aquatic concentrations of Mn, Ca, Mg, suspended material and alkalinity, a decrease in the concentrations of TOC and H3O+, while for Al and Fe there was a change in control mechanisms. The concentration and control changes after ditching are related to changes in hydrological pathways and to the exposure of both organic (peat) and inorganic (mineral soil) lavers on the ditch slopes.

AB  - Changes in the landscape affect not only people's well-being but also how people perceive and use the landscape. An increasing number of policies have highlighted the importance of conserving a landscape's recreational and aesthetical values. This study develops and evaluates a model that links people's perceptions of a mountain landscape to physical monitoring data. Using a questionnaire, we revealed how respondents working with the Swedish mountains characterise the Magnificent Mountain landscape (as defined by Swedish policy objectives) and translated these characteristics into data from the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden (NILS). We found 14 potential indicators that could be derived from the existing NILS physical monitoring data and which could be used to monitor changes in the landscape values as perceived by people. Based on the results, we suggest how to simultaneously utilise field sampling of physical data and field photos to provide temporal information about landscape perception.

AB  - In this study, 236 regeneration areas (mostly clear-cuts) in southern Norway were selected by random stratified selection: 118 of the study units were cut before and 118 after the introduction of forest certification in 1998. The degree of compliance with biodiversity measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001 and the Norwegian standard "Living Forests'') was compared in a field study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21% of the postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41% had either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road transport, little improvement was seen. The discussion examines whether it is probable that the changes seen are a result of forest certification in Norway.

Compact city planning and development has, over the last 30 years or so, been the preferred response to the challenges of sustainable development. It is strongly promoted by global and local policies due to its positive outcomes in terms of contributing to the economic, environmental, and social goals of sustainability. This paper examines how the compact city model is practiced and justified in urban planning and development with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, and whether any progress has been made in this regard. To illuminate this urban phenomenon accordingly, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology where the empirical basis is mainly formed by the official plans and documents of two Swedish cities: Gothenburg and Helsingborg, in combination with qualitative interview data and secondary data. This study shows that compactness, density, diversity, mixed land use, sustainable transportation, and green space are the core design strategies of compact city planning and development, with the latter being contextually linked to the concept of green structure, an institutional setup under which the two cities operate. Moreover, at the core of the compact city model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects with respect to the benefits of sustainability as to its tripartite composition. Further, this study demonstrates that the compact city model as practiced by the two cities is justified by its ability to contribute to the economic, environmental, and social goals of sustainability. However, the economic goals dominate over the environmental and social goals, notwithstanding the claim about the three dimensions of sustainability being equally important at the discursive level. Nevertheless, new measures are being developed and implemented to strengthen their influence over urban planning and development practices towards balancing the three goals of sustainability.

AB  - Assessing ecological sustainability involves monitoring of indicators and comparison of their states with performance targets that are deemed sustainable. First, a normative model was developed centered on evidence-based knowledge about (a) forest composition, structure, and function at multiple scales, and (b) performance targets derived by quantifying the habitat amount in naturally dynamic forests, and as required for presence of populations of specialized focal species. Second, we compared the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standards' ecological indicators from 1998 and 2010 in Sweden to the normative model using a Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Realistic, and Timebound (SMART) indicator approach. Indicator variables and targets for riparian and aquatic ecosystems were clearly under-represented compared to terrestrial ones. FSC's ecological indicators expanded over time from composition and structure towards function, and from finer to coarser spatial scales. However, SMART indicators were few. Moreover, they poorly reflected quantitative evidence-based knowledge, a consequence of the fact that forest certification mirrors the outcome of a complex social negotiation process.

AB  - Community-based management (CBM) has been implemented in socio-ecological systems (SES) worldwide. CBM has also been the prevailing policy in Sami pastoral SES in Norway, but the outcomes tend to vary extensively among resource groups ("siidas"). We asked why do some siidas self-organize to manage common pool resources sustainably and others do not? To answer this question we used a mixed methods approach. First, in the statistical analyses we analyzed the relationship between sustainability indicators and structural variables. We found that small winter pastures that are shared by few siidas were managed more sustainably than larger pastures. Seasonal siida stability, i.e., a low turnover of pastoralists working together throughout the year, and equality among herders, also contributed to more sustainable outcomes. Second, interviews were conducted in the five largest pastures to explain the relationships between the structural variables and sustainability. The pastoralists expressed a high level of agreement with respect to sustainable policies, but reported a low level of trust and cooperation among the siidas. The pastoralists requested siida tenures or clear rules and sanctioning mechanisms by an impartial authority rather than flexible organization or more autonomy for the siidas. The lack of nestedness in self-organization for managing pastures on larger scales, combined with the past economic policies, could explain why CBM is less sustainable on the largest winter pastures. We conclude that the scale mis-match between self-organization and the formal governance is a key condition for sustainability.

AB  - This article tells the story of long-lasting and ongoing struggles surrounding the construction plans for a major reservoir on the headwaters of the Kemi River in the Finnish Province of Lapland. A point of contention since the beginning of hydropower development on the river in the mid twentieth century, the reservoir project has been promoted and abandoned multiple times in waves of land purchasing, legal procedures, opposition campaigns, and the delineation of nature reserves. Despite a Finnish Supreme Administrative Court ruling officially setting an end to the project, it never entirely left public discourse and is currently being re-negotiated in slightly adapted form. Articulating voices and documenting practices of riverbank inhabitants, activists and hydro electricity managers, this article presents the struggle as multiple modes of heterogeneous engineering, where both proponents and opponents work towards creating different realities. The article develops the metaphor of heterogeneous engineering by drawing attention to three temporal dimensions central to the reservoir struggle: moments, which refer to the situated emergence of practices and strategies; futures, which speak to the attempts to build and contest expectations regarding conflicting projects; and durations, which consider the cumulative aspects of a decades-long struggle on people and landscapes. Thereby, the article contributes to discussions on making, planning and environmental management, and illustrates ways of studying these processes as situated practices in relation to time.

AB  - Strategies for preserving biodiversity in boreal forests should include the maintenance of coarse woody debris (CWD) because this substrate is a key feature for the preservation of many threatened species. Computer simulation programs are useful tools for predicting the amount of CWD that will arise if certain management practices are applied in the long term. We have constructed and used a simulation program based on stochastic equations, which aims at predicting the amount of CWD in homogenous stands of Norway spruce in central Scandinavia. Because the rate of tree mortality is a critical factor in such simulations, we present such data derived from spruce-dominated forests surveyed in the Swedish National Forest Inventory.
   A comparison between simulation outcomes and field data shows that the average quantity of CWD in today's managed forest is possible to predict using the simulation model. If the forest is managed according to the Forest Certification Standard, the amount of CWD (diameter larger than 10 cm) will be almost three times higher as the amount in today's managed forests. The amount of CWD was found to be highest in old stands and immediately after cutting. In stands of an intermediate age the amount of CWD was low, especially CWD in early decay stages and of larger sizes. High productivity and long rotation time tended, on average, to increase the amount of CWD in stands. Among the management practices recommended in the new biodiversity-oriented forestry, retention of small areas with living trees is the most efficient way to increase the average amount and continuous occurrence of CWD within a stand, at least if the retained areas are as productive as the main part of the stands.

T2  - 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ECOHYDRAULICS
LA  - English
CP  - 11th International Symposium on Ecohydraulics
AB  - In regulated rivers, reduced habitat size due to reduced flows is often considered as a bottleneck for fish production. Increasing the flow will lead to a loss in hydropower production, and in high-head hydropower schemes this is costly. Finding a balance between hydropower production and environmental interests are thus vital. Residual flow targets are usually determined after analyzing modeled or measured discharge to wetted area relationships or by using natural low flow metrics like Q(95) (5-percentile of yearly discharge). Effects of habitat quality is usually ignored or underestimated, wetted area is used as a proxy for the biological productivity of a river [7, 8]. Often and sometimes alternatively, to residual flows, groundsills and other small impoundments have been designed to maximize wetted area in residual flow stretches [7, 8]. The underlying assumption is that an increase in wetted area corresponds to a linear increase in the fish productivity of the river. Our results suggest that this assumption is not necessarily correct. Improved physical habitat quality, determined as a function of spawning and shelter availability, can compensate for losses in wetted area and even multiply total fish production. Instead of using just wetted area as a proxy for fish production, both habitat size (wetted area) AND physical habitat quality ought to be addressed.

AB  - Aim: The diversity and distributions of organisms are jointly influenced by local environment and large-scale variables, such as land cover patterns, dispersal processes and climate. However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers' effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings.
   Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N).
   Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity.
   Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites.
   Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.

AB  - Increasing focus on sustainability affects all parts of the energy system. The future integration of the power and road transport system due to the introduction of electric drive vehicles influences the economically optimal investments and optimal operation of the power system. This work presents analysis of the optimal configuration and operation of the integrated power and road transport system in Northern Europe, i.e. Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden using the optimization model, Balmorel, with a transport model extension. A number of scenarios have been set up, including sensitivity on CO2 and oil prices, inclusion/exclusion of electric drive vehicles, and change in investment possibilities in flexible power plants. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are shown to be competitive in all scenarios except the low oil scenarios. The increased electricity consumption for the electric vehicles is covered by wind power in Denmark and Norway and by coal production in Finland and Germany. The competition between wind power and coal is dependent on fuel price and CO2 price assumptions. Furthermore, introducing the flexibility of electric drive vehicles helps decrease cycling on the remaining power plants. Finally, the electric drive vehicles can replace the use of both heat storage and electric boilers as well as decrease the use of gas turbines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Paris Agreement suggests that all countries engage in significant emission reductions. To stay within safe guardrails, usually defined as a maximum warming of 1.5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial times, this will mean decarbonisation within less than 30 years. This significant challenge is complicated because of growth in some sectors, such as tourism. This paper analyses emissions and economic output in Norway, considering national Tourism Satellite Accounts. Novel aspects of this paper include a longitudinal perspective covering 12 years through which critical developments and progress on emission reduction pathways can be assessed. Findings suggest that the carbon intensity of tourism (emissions per NOK) is more than twice the Norwegian economy average. Aviation in particular is a major barrier to emission reductions, as it generates 17% of national tourism revenue and 75% of direct tourism emissions. Trend extrapolation shows that tourism will be the largest emission sub-sector of the Norwegian economy by 2030. The Norwegian economy will have to decarbonise at a rate more than 30 times faster than its current rate, if it is to decarbonise to mid-century, while continuing on its observed economic growth trajectory.

AB  - Because of their close relationships to the land, water, and resources therein, and their marginalized social and economic positions, Indigenous peoples living in current or former settler colonies are particularly vulnerable to mining's impacts, yet have the potential to benefit from its opportunities as well. This paper reviews the literature on large-scale mining projects' relationships to Indigenous peoples in post/colonial contexts, focusing on Australia, Canada, Finland, Greenland, New Caledonia, Norway, and Sweden, in the aim of generating insights from comparative perspectives. First, we discuss differences in legal regimes governing Indigenous peoples' rights and implications of those rights for negotiations over mining projects. Next, we examine, in turn, mining activities' various impacts - environmental, economic, social - and how they specifically affect Indigenous communities. Finally, we explore ways that Indigenous communities living in a post/colonial context have addressed large-scale mining projects' impacts by engaging with them, through both negotiation and resistance. We conclude by summarizing our findings on the relationships of Indigenous peoples to large-scale mining projects in the focus countries and identifying what gaps remain in the literature, and we provide thoughts as to how future research could address those gaps.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food producing sector in the world with an annual growth rate of 7%. In Norway alone production of this industry is projected to expand from 1.2 million tons today to 5 million tons by 2050, implying a rapid increase in the demand for sustainable salmon feed alternatives to conventional feed resources such as fish meal and fish oil. Yeast produced from nonfood resources such as wood can serve as a high-quality protein source for farmed fish. In this study we analyze how commercial wood-based feed production in Norway using softwood chips from roundwood and sawmill residues will influence wood fiber prices. Such production will have to compete for wood fiber with wood-based bioenergy in particular, and the analyses were done assuming three main scenarios of expected global consumption of wood for bioenergy. The first scenario (Base) assumes a modest use of wood-based bioenergy reflecting the EU climate mitigation target for 2030. The second (MaxEnergy) and third (MaxEnergyLowRes) scenarios assume using bioenergy at a scale sufficient to fulfill IPCC's 2 degrees C climate mitigation target, with the only difference that in the MaxBio scenario tree stump utilization is allowed in Europe and USA. The bio-economic global partial equilibrium model EFI-GTM was applied to assess the economic impacts. Yeast production from wood in Norway could be able to pay from 37 to 64 euro/m3 of wood delivered mill site, the large variation depending on the yeast production costs other than wood biomass and the price of alternative fish feed resources. Other factors e.g. improved salmon health due to using wood-based yeast and environmental policy regulations of soya meal productions may increase this paying ability. To get 3 million m(3) of wood per year during the period 2020-2030 for producing 330 t yeast it would be necessary to pay about 54, 47 and 55 euro/m(3) in the scenarios Base, Bio and BioLowRes, respectively. The wood quantity supplied to the salmon feed production from additional Norwegian harvest will be rather low. If production of wood-based yeast for fish feed proves to be viable in Norway, it is likely to be attractive also in other aquaculture regions like Northand South America and Scotland, implying increased wood demand and higher wood prices than estimated above. Microbial ingredients like yeast produced from non-food biomass such as wood, offer potentials for commercial production. However, the present costs of producing yeast from lignocellulosic biomass may still be too high, and there is a need to develop more efficient processes for economic utilization.

AB  - Second homes are widespread in the Finnish countryside and represent a significant part of domestic tourism. In this paper impacts of rural second home tourism on natural environment and landscape are discussed mainly from a non-anthropocentric point of view and from the perspective of ecological sustainability. Both negative and positive impacts of second home tourism on nature, climate and landscape are distinguished Environmental impacts caused by housing and living, shoreline building and physical mobility related to second home tourism are highlighted. It is argued that mobility related to second home tourism and year-round use of second homes are likely to increase in the near future and consequently pose negative environmental impacts. The argument is based on current societal trends and on results of a questionnaire survey conducted amongst second-home owners living in the metropolitan region of Helsinki and possessing second homes in eastern Finnish Lake District. There is today a large political will to enhance second home tourism in Finland, which is seen crucial for revitalizing the declining countryside. Contradictions between rural development policy on one hand, and environmental protection on the other, are critically discussed and ecological sustainability of second home tourism explored.

AB  - Since its beginning in the early 70thies, the fast growing Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry in Norway has been and still is an object for research across numerous disciplines and research fields. This article presents an overview of the research studies applying Material Flow Analysis (MFA) based methods on Norwegian Aquaculture of Atlantic Salmon starting from 2004 until 2018. The studies were reviewed in relation to their applied method, involved institutions, flows, data acquisition, and suggestions for improvement. All of the reviewed studies applied different MFA methods suitable to the objective of each study, were done with involvement of multiple institutions and stakeholders, modeled credible data and provided specific suggestions for reducing the environmental impacts and optimizing nutrients utilization efficiency. The review concludes that MFA-based methods have the potential for having a functional role within the framework of the Norwegian Salmon Aquaculture industry's sustainable development. A key factor in fulfilling that potential would be diversifying the objectives of MFA research to be more inclusive of the three pillars of sustainability: environment, economy, and society.

AB  - The need to preserve biodiversity has been recognized for decades, even centuries in North America, Europe and some other regions of the world. importance of preserving species and wildlife areas is emphasized in many cultures. Preservation of biodiversity in forest management, and especially in industrial logging, is one of the most important tasks of modern forestry. In many countries with the developed forest complex (Finland, Sweden, etc.), the task of preserving natural biodiversity has the same priority in the state forest policy as providing the forest industry with wood raw materials. The main requirements for the biodiversity preservation in Russia are enshrined in the National Standard (Forest Code of the Russian Federation, article 1) governing Voluntary Forest Certification. Organization of forest management in the Vologda region is carried out with consideration of significant aspects of biodiversity preservation. The research purpose is the forestry and economic assessment of biodiversity at the local level in the taiga zone (case study of the Vologda region). The assessment was carried out based on the inventory characteristic obtained in the field studies. The methodological provisions of E.A. Rai and S.I. Slastnikov were used to perform economic assessment of the preservation of key objects. A comparison of the costs of timber logging in biotopes and the income from its sale (in the case of logging stands in key biotopes with the subsequent sale of the resulting timber) showed significant differences between the objects under consideration. It is shown that according to the assortment structure, a significant part of the studied biotopes accrue to firewood. The cost of timber varies from 9.6 to 529.5 ths rubles. The amount of costs at different sites will vary significantly from 9.0 to 340.5 ths rubles due to the possible cutting of key biotopes. At the same time, a negative financial result is observed only at one site (a forest site with a habitat of Neckera pennata, which is included in the Red Data Book of the Vologda Region). The results demonstrate that the allocation of key sites and their further preservation is environmentally sound, but in some cases (when compared with the income from their cutting) is not commercially justified.

AB  - Little attention has been paid to fragmentation effects on organisms living in open habitats in which species may have high mobility and generalized habitat use. We investigated landscape effects on 23 farmland bird species breeding in 72 semi-natural dry pastures distributed equally among three landscape types (agricultural-dominated, mosaic, and forest-dominated) in southcentral Sweden. There were generally higher local abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated and mosaic landscapes than in forest-dominated landscapes. Species feeding on a mixed diet as well as resident species and temperate migrants were most numerous in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes and least numerous in forest-dominated landscapes. While controlling for the effects of local pasture area and vegetation structure, we found that the local abundance of 18 (78%) farmland bird species was significantly associated with the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape. The landscape distance that explained the largest part of local variation in abundance varied among species according to the size of their breeding territories or foraging home ranges. Our results suggest that habitat use of farmland birds breeding in pastures is affected both by suitable foraging habitats in the surrounding landscape and by nest sites within local pastures. Despite the generally higher abundances of farmland birds in pastures located in agricultural-dominated landscapes, most species of European and Swedish conservation concern had higher abundance in pastures located in more forested landscapes. Thus, the rapid loss of semi-natural dry pastures in forest-dominated landscapes is a serious threat to the future of these species in Sweden.

AB  - The recolonising wolf Canis lupus population has created conflicts in Scandinavia, and it will eventually be necessary to control wolf numbers if the population continues to grow. One mechanism for this is hunting. Under what circumstances will the Swedish public support hunting of wolves? We examined this question for the general public and for three stakeholder groups: all hunters, the public living in areas with wolf populations and hunters living in wolf population areas. A majority of all four groups found it acceptable to hunt wolves to reduce the risk of livestock depredation (53-91%), and if wolves had been coming into populated areas (54-86%). However, about one fifth of the Swedish public was neutral to any justification, so an extreme or a well-publicised event could alter the current levels of support. The majority in all groups did not support wolf hunting merely because people were afraid of them (22-46%), or because wolves compete with humans for game (11-45%). A majority of all hunters found wolf hunting to be justified if wolves were a threat to dogs in the area, but the majority of the general public even in the wolf population areas did not find this to be appropriate justification. Our study shows the importance of surveying stakeholder groups as well as the general public to develop sound and acceptable conservation and management plans for rebounding populations of large carnivores such as wolves.

AB  - Invasive alien species constitute an increasing risk to forestry, as indeed to natural systems in general. This study reviews the legislative framework governing invasive species in the EU and Sweden, drawing upon both a legal analysis and interviews with main national level agencies responsible for implementing this framework. The study concludes that EU and Sweden are limited in how well they can act on invasive species, in particular because of the weak interpretation of the precautionary principle in the World Trade Organisation and Sanitary and Phytosanitary agreements. In the Swedish case, this interpretation also conflicts with the stronger interpretation of the precautionary principle under the Swedish Environmental Code, which could in itself provide for stronger possibilities to act on invasive species.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of extreme weather conditions on runoff, nutrient, and soil loss from agriculture-dominated catchments at different locations in Norway.
   Design/methodology/approach - Four catchments have been selected to study the potential effects of climate change on runoff and nutrient loss. The catchments are part of the Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme in Norway (JOVA) and represent different climatological conditions, agricultural production systems/practices, and soil types. Different characteristics were calculated on the basis of existing measurements and evaluated with respect to climate change.
   Findings - In four selected catchments, climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in runoff. Under similar land use and tillage methods, this will most likely lead to an increase in nutrient and soil loss. Milder winters as a consequence of climate change might lead to extreme runoff conditions and severe erosion, caused by a combination of frozen soil, snowmelt, and intense rainfall. Existing large diurnal variations in discharge have to be taken into consideration in the future design of hydrotechnical implementations. Information about the potential effects of climate change on runoff generation, the magnitude of the different hydrological flow paths, and their potential effects on nutrient and soil loss processes is necessary in choosing the right mitigation measures.
   Originality/value - Long time series on runoff and water quality (such as those collected in small agriculture-dominated catchments as part of the Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme in Norway (JOVA)) are rare, but indispensable in evaluating the potential effects of climate change on nutrient and soil loss.

AB  - In addition to habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural change has led to a change in seed dispersal processes in the rural landscape through a loss of structural and functional connectivity. Here, human-mediated dispersal vectors are prevalent, and we explored whether the loss of connectivity via free-ranging livestock could be mitigated by the increase in roads and motor vehicles. We found that structurally, 39% of all valuable semi-natural grassland habitats in southern Sweden are adjacent to public road verges, which in the rural landscape are often considered to be suitable habitat for grassland species. Additionally, by collecting mud attached to cars and farming machinery and manure from livestock (cattle, horse, sheep) grazing semi-natural grassland pasture, we found that motor vehicles are also capable seed dispersers. A similar number of species were dispersed by both vectors, although the composition of samples was quite different. Motor vehicles dispersed more grassland specialists than invasive species, although in much lower abundances than did grazing livestock. Despite these differences, motor vehicles were found to be able to disperse species with the same kinds of dispersal traits as livestock. A high number of seeds, species and specialists in manure samples means that greater movement of livestock is desirable to increase functional grassland connectivity. However, effective management could improve the suitability of roadsides as grassland corridors and increase the availability of seeds for long-distance human-mediated dispersal via cars and tractors. Our results suggest that in many rural landscapes, connectivity by road networks could help mediate habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands. However, such effects can be context dependent, and the connectivity provided by roads could have serious negative consequences in other regions.

AB  - Zoning is such a cornerstone of the US planning system that for US planners it may be hard to imagine that one can regulate development without it. But is zoning a widely shared institution? Is it as integral to the planning systems of other "developed" nations as it is in the United States? Based on a review of literature and planning documents, this article contrasts land-use regulation in five European countries (England, France, Germany, Sweden, and Russia) to that in the United States. It argues that far from being universal, zoning (at least the type of land-use zoning routinely applied in the United States) is not practiced in Europe. The comparison allows us to appreciate the uniqueness of US institutions and speculate on the cultural underpinnings of the European-American differences.

AB  - This article compares the use, policy, and debate concerning introduced tree species in the five Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland). These countries have a long common history and are culturally similar. They are often framed under the benchmark of the Nordic Model or even the Nordic Forestry Model. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Nordic countries' treatment of introduced tree species share common aspects, and that global environmental agreements and international currents in science and policy have reinforced these similarities. The comparison shows that globalization is strong and it seems, at least at a first glimpse, that the Nordic countries follow a kind of Nordic Model in their approach to introduced tree species. However, the history and importance of forestry, ecological conditions, afforestation campaigns, traditions of using introduced trees, understandings, and stakeholder positions have shaped different national and even regional path dependencies and circumstances. This, in turn, has transmuted international policy-making, regulations, and discussions into different specific ways to interpret, control, and implement the use of introduced trees in practice. This article concludes that global environmental agreements and international currents in science and policy adapt to diverse national contexts.

AB  - This article analyses Finland's forest policy from the perspective of the Pathways to Sustainability approach. The historical roots and political dynamics between key actor coalitions, as well as their key concerns around sustain ability in forest policy are first outlined. After this contextualisation, we identify the current dominant pathway by analysing recent official policy documents (2010-2015) that focus on the future challenges for Finnish forestry. Additionally, we analyse the implementation of the pathway through the revision of the Forest Act (2011-2013). Our analysis shows that the dominant pathway to sustainability in Finnish forest policy aims at reconciling the different dimensions of sustainability by producing "more of everything". Yet there are underlying conflicts and priorities between different goals within this pathway, Which are not openly addressed. The dominant pathway has co-aligned with the global bioeconomy meta-discourse that has contributed to the re legitimisation of policy goals from previous industrial forestry eras. Prioritisation of production over ecological concerns are, however, challenged by the environmental coalition and in conflict with the views of the general public that has become more conscious about conservation, biodiversity and recreation. This resulted in intense struggles during the revision of the Forest Act, however with the production goals persisting over conservation. Our analysis concludes that the dominant pathway aims to safeguard increased timber production, and the studied period saw a political shift back towards more hierarchical policymaking that promotes a productivist forest policy under the guise of a "forest bioeconomy".

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are considered as means to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss while simultaneously enhancing human well-being. Yet, it is still poorly understood how NBS could be mainstreamed. We address this gap by proposing a framework on NBS and employing it in Finland's Kiiminkijoki River basin through participatory workshops and a questionnaire. We examine socio-environmental challenges and visions, existing and emerging NBS to reach the visions, and ways to scale-up NBS to a river basin level. In the river basin, water quality is the priority challenge, due to its relationships with local culture, climate change, and biodiversity. Our results consider how (1) to ensure the relevance of NBS for local actors, (2) instrumental, intrinsic, and relational value perspectives can be enhanced simultaneously by NBS, and (3) site specific NBS can be mainstreamed (i.e., by scaling up, down, out, in, deep) to the river basin level and beyond.

AB  - Restoration of floodplain forests has become a primary aim of sustainable forestry in Europe. Although several studies have investigated the conversion of coniferous stands outside of their biogeographical area and on unsuitable sites, none focused specifically on alluvial areas. We surveyed 208 riverine stands, distributed homogeneously throughout the Grand-duche de Luxembourg (western-central Europe) for the abundance of woody forest species (trees, saplings, seedlings and shrubs). The influence of both the canopy nature (Norway spruce or deciduous) and the biogeographical region (Oesling or Gutland) on the understorey regeneration were tested. The mean species richness was 10.5 woody plants per stand. Correspondence analyses showed that canopy tree regeneration was not different between the two forest types. Following an analysis of variance, we found that functional species group distribution (regarding mode of dispersal, type of seed bank and establishment strategy) was more determined by the biogeographical variable than by the canopy variable. Most woody species were significantly more abundant in deciduous forests and in the Gutland area. Only Rubus idaeus, Sambucus racemosa and Sorbus aucuparia were strongly associated with Norway spruce stands or the Oesling region. The differences between deciduous forests and coniferous stands are mainly due to shrub abundance and not to the canopy tree regeneration. In conclusion, Norway spruce plantations act as nurseries for late-successional riverine species like Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus robur.

AB  - In the Baltic States region, anthropogenic disturbances at different temporal and spatial scales mostly determine dynamics and development phases of forest ecosystems. We reviewed the state and condition of hemiboreal forests of the Baltic States region and analyzed species composition of recently established and permanent forest (PF). Agricultural deforestation and spontaneous or artificial conversion back to forest is a scenario leading to ecosystems designated as recent forest (RF, age up to two hundred years). Permanent forest (PF) was defined as areas with no records of agricultural activity during the last 200 yr, including mostly forests managed by traditional even-aged (clear-cut) silviculture and salvage after natural disturbances. We hypothesized that RF would have distinctive composition, with higher dominance by hardwoods (e.g., aspen and birch), compared to PF. Ordination revealed divergence in the RF stands; about half had the hypothesized composition distinct from PF, with a tight cluster of stands in the part of the ordination space with high hardwood dominance, while the remaining RF stands were scattered throughout the ordination space occupied by PF with highly variable species composition. Planting of conifers, variability in site quality, and variability in spatial proximity to PF with relatively natural ecosystem legacies likely explained the variable compositions of this latter group of RF. We positioned the observations of RF in a classic quantification of site type conditions (based on Estonian forest vegetation survey previously carried out by LA mu hmus), which indicated that RF was more likely to occur on areas of higher soil fertility (in ordination space). Climatic and anthropogenic changes to RF create complex dynamic trends that are difficult to project into the future. Further research in tracing land use changes (using pollen analysis and documented evidence) should be utilized to refine the conceptual framework of ecosystem legacy and memory. Occurrence and frequency of deforestation and its characteristics as a novel disturbance regime are of particular interest.

AB  - While the populations of cities continue to grow, institutions are demanding more sustainability in urban development, leading to a great increase in the complexity of urban planning. The need to consider social, legal, environmental, and economic parameters challenges the traditional urban planning processing in favor of an optimized and automated process. Generative design has the potential to optimize the design phase by automatically generating spatial design solutions and analyzing them in the design phase. The objective of the present study is to analyze the traditional urban planning process and to compare it with a digitalized driven process by using generative design. This study uses a mixed approach with four research methods: document analysis, survey, interviews, and a case study based in Sweden. The critical analysis of the Swedish urban planning process makes it possible to define the main barriers to a digitalized process. Results also show the benefits of using generative design for a more sustainable and faster design process. Two main conclusions can be made from this study: institutional and organizational changes are necessary to achieve digitalization, and generative design proves to be a useful tool that should be considered to support the digitalization of urban planning.

AB  - In Kattegat and the coastal water of the Baltic Sea, high nitrogen input from agricultural land is considered to be the main reason for eutrophication. International agreements and governmental programs have set a target to reduce the anthropogenic nitrogen load by 50 percent. Improved nitrogen removal in treatment plants and efforts in agriculture have so far not decreased nitrogen transport to a sufficient extent. In this project the impact of agricultural practices on nitrogen leaching was investigated in two small agricultural catchments in Southwest Sweden. The root-zone leaching was estimated by an indexing technique. Simultaneously the transports in the stream outlets were monitored. During 1995 and 1999 the agricultural practices in the catchments were surveyed. Field data from the first survey indicated that fertilisation did not always match crop requirements, the area of undersown catch crop can be increased and autumn cultivation can be reduced. The second survey was preceded by an advisory campaign where each farmer was visited and presented with an environmental plan including fertilisation, cultivation, and crop rotation for the farm. The plan summarised the best management practices that could be realised under actual conditions. Results from the second survey showed that some changes in the agricultural practices were carried out after the advisory campaign. The nitrogen leaching from the root-zone was then estimated by the indexing technique, both for the time before and after the advisory program. The results showed that the estimated nitrogen leaching, as a mean value for 330 fields, decreased from 53 to 50 kgN ha(-1), due to adjustments of the agricultural practices. Monitoring of stream transports showed values of the same magnitude after correction for retention and other sources. In this short time perspective, decreases in transport due to changes in agricultural practices could not be separated from influence of weather conditions. In comparison to results from the Swedish monitoring programme for agriculture, the measured transports were normal for the region, where annual variation in precipitation and runoff is large. Theoretically, nitrogen leaching could be reduced by one third without any major economic constraints for the farmers. In general, the farmers were positive to advice and Willing to try new farming techniques even if some measurements were not fully implemented during the investigation period.

AB  - Urbanization and subsequent disturbance, habitat alteration and fragmentation are usually seen as major threats to biodiversity. However, habitat alterations might also create new habitat types that can be used by the local fauna. Here, we tested whether hole-nesting passerines use forest edges next to open grassland areas for reproduction by assessing five golf courses in the Helsinki region in southern Finland. We found a major effect in all species breeding at our sites (great tit, Parus major; blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus; pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca): both nest occupancy and the number of offspring were significantly higher at the artificial edges than 50 m into the original forests. We conclude that man-made suburban forest edges provide suitable habitat for nesting, which could be further improved with the addition of nest boxes.

AB  - In the coastal areas of North Norway farm abandonment followed by regrowth and reforestation is a major factor leading to landscape change. One consequence of this change is that archaeological sites are lost. A survey programme started by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 1997, aimed at monitoring the condition of archaeological sites listed in the Norwegian National Sites and Monuments Record, has documented that regrowth processes represent a threat to the sites. The extent of the problem of regrowth and reforestation of archaeological sites is mostly unknown, however, and efficient coping strategies are not developed. In this article we present a change detection method based on the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) applied to Landsat images with different acquisition dates, followed by image differencing. This procedure results in an easily interpretable and extremely quick approach to change detection of land cover as well as change in biomass, and it can be used as a 'first warning' method to indicate archaeological sites threatened by regrowth processes. The method as it is applied in this study appears to be most suitable for monitoring changes in the infield areas where contrasts are clearest. Further development is possible, both at the regional level using medium resolution satellite remote sensing where the aim is to detect significant changes in the agricultural as well as the cultural landscape, and at the site level, where use of the same method on data from high-resolution sensors will allow monitoring of the site on a very detailed scale.

AB  - AimTo integrate two major components of vulnerability to climate change: adaptive capacity (approached by genetic groups) and exposure (approached by risk of habitat loss) illustrated with the maritime (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and Aleppo (Pinus halepensis Mill.) pines. To integrate such information in the selection of conservation strategies (ex situ vs. in situ) and to evaluate current European efforts in the conservation of forest genetic resources.
   LocationMediterranean Basin and European Atlantic coast.
   MethodsWith the objective of preserving the overall genetic diversity of our two target species, we individually assess each of their genetic groups. We fit a species distribution model and project it to current climate and 42 different future climatic predictions. We create future suitability maps to assess risk of habitat loss based on the number of future climate projections that predict suitability. According to this assessment on the risk of habitat loss, we propose suitable conservation strategies.
   ResultsWe found areas suitable for in situ conservation for most of the genetic groups, the exception being the central-eastern-southern Iberian genetic groups of maritime pine and the Moroccan genetic group of Aleppo pine which required ex situ conservation. In the current European conservation network, three genetic groups for maritime pine and two for Aleppo pine remain unrepresented, and the representation of the rest is unbalanced.
   Main conclusionsWe provide a tool to support conservation management of forest trees, an increasingly important task given the negative impact of climate change on forest ecosystems. We also provide a framework to increase the efficiency of the European conservation network: (i) exposure assessment should be considered as a requirement for a population to become a dynamic conservation unit (DCU); and (ii) as illustrated with our two target species, the selection of DCUs should represent all existing genetic groups.

AB  - The principle role of agriculture is to produce food for the increasing human population. However, the environmental footprint needs to be simultaneously reduced. Data from the Finnish Food Authority (181,108 parcels in the south-western crop production region of Finland) were used to identify the farming system, farm type, farm size, field parcel scale, physical parcel characteristics, cultivated crops, crop rotations and cultivars. Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were used to identify fields with very low productivity. Thereby, the impacts of farm and field characteristics on risks of low NDVI values and their associated means of coping by the farmer were studied. High variations in field parcel characteristics and growth capacity were typical in the studied area. Although it is challenging for farmers, high variation can provide many opportunities for the development of multifunctional and resource-smart production systems, e.g., by optimizing land use: allocating high-quality fields for food production, and poorly performing fields for extensification, i.e., the production of environmental benefits. Many usable policy instruments are available to support such a transition, but more focus should be put onto the most efficient means to enable progress towards environmentally, economically and socially sustainable high-latitude agricultural systems.

AB  - We investigated the association of habitat fragmentation with genetic structure of male black grouse Tetrao tetrix. Using 14 microsatellites, we compared the genetic differentiation of males among nine localities in continuous lowland habitats in Finland to the genetic differentiation among 14 localities in fragmented habitats in the Alps (France, Switzerland and Italy). In both areas, we found significant genetic differentiation. However, the average differentiation, measured as 0, was more than three times higher in the Alps than in Finland. The greater differentiation found in the Alps is probably due to the presence of mountain ridges rising above natural habitats of the species, which form barriers to gene flow, and to a higher influence of genetic drift resulting from lower effective sizes in highly fragmented habitats. The detection of isolation by distance in the Alps suggests that gene flow among populations does occur. The genetic variability measured as gene diversity HE and allelic richness A was lower in the Alps than in Finland. This could result from the higher fragmentation and/or from the fact that populations in the Alps are isolated from the main species range and have a lower effective size than in Finland. This study suggests that habitat fragmentation can affect genetic structure of avian species with relatively high dispersal propensities.

AB  - Peatlands worldwide are being threatened by intensive land use and drainage, which leads to soil subsidence. This has consequences for farming, especially on low-gradient cultivated peat-dominated lowlands with high flood risk. In this study, we combined historical soil elevation data and new lidar data to improve the estimation of subsidence and its consequences for lowland river systems. The results showed 202-349 mm subsidence within the last 24-51 years, with a mean rate of 5.15-9.47 mm y(-1) for riparian peatland on the west coast of Finland. The subsidence rate was partly explained by the depth of the organic soil layer (R-2 = 0.710, p > 0.05). The results also showed that increasing flooding of cultivated fields is mainly due to soil subsidence, not to increased flooding occurrence in river systems. The area flooded annually was found to increase by 101-194 % for the last 24-51 years, due to soil subsidence near rivers. Generalization of the results to catchment scale indicated an increase in the annual flood zone of 45 % in cultivated fields in one of two study catchments (Siikajoki river basin). These results demonstrate the value of using historical data to study soil subsidence and confirm that the risk of flooding increases in cultivated organic lowlands due to intensive drainage and subsidence. New management strategies, such as peatland rewetting, restoration, and paludiculture, should be considered in future land use plans to reduce subsidence and provide new income streams for farmers.

AB  - The Norwegian Nature Index is intended to provide an overview of the state of biodiversity in Norway. From the perspective of the sociology of knowledge, the author explores how biologists make sense of biodiversity and how they identify scientific uncertainty in the context of the Nature Index. Anchoring and themata are employed as tools for analysis in the investigation of scientists' representation of the Nature Index and its subject matter, namely biodiversity. In-depth interviews indicated that most of the scientists perceived the results as intuitively sound, but they also revealed an outspoken ambivalence about compressing complex ecological relationships into standardized numbers. In covering both natural and cultural landscapes as habitats for biodiversity, there seems to be a symbolic mismatch between the operationalization of biodiversity in the index and the intuitive anchoring of biodiversity as untouched nature. Hence, the thematizing of the divide between the untouched and what is human may be seen as a form of conceptual uncertainty underlying the Nature Index.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of pathogen transfer in aquaculture systems is essential to manage and mitigate disease outbreaks. The goal of this study was to understand recent transmission dynamics of salmonid alphavirus (SAV) in Norway. SAV causes significant economic impacts on farmed salmonids in European aquaculture. SAV is classified into six subtypes, with Norway having ongoing epidemics of SAV subtypes 2 and 3. These two viral subtypes are present in largely distinct geographic regions of Norway, with SAV2 present in Trondelag, SAV3 in Rogaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Hordaland, and More og Romsdal having outbreaks of both subtypes. To determine likely transmission routes of Norwegian SAV an established Nanopore amplicon sequencing approach was used in the current study. After confirming the accuracy of this approach for distinguishing subtype level co-infections of SAV2 and SAV3, a hypothetical possibility in regions of neighboring epidemics, twenty-four SAV3 genomes were sequenced to characterize the current genetic diversity of SAV3 in Norwegian aquaculture. Sequencing was performed on naturally infected heart tissues originating from a range of geographic locations sampled between 2016 and 2019. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the currently active SAV3 strains sampled comprise several distinct lineages sharing an ancestor that existed similar to 15 years ago (95% HPD, 12.51-17.7 years) and likely in Hordaland. At least five of these lineages have not shared a common ancestor for 7.85 years (95% HPD, 5.39-10.96 years) or more. Furthermore, the ancestor of the strains that were sampled outside of Hordaland (Sogn of Fjordane and Rogaland) existed less than 8 years ago, indicating a lack of long-term viral reservoirs in these counties. This evident lack of geographically distinct subclades is compatible with a source-sink transmission dynamic explaining the long-term movements of SAV around Norway. Such anthropogenic transport of the virus indicates that at least for sink counties, biosecurity strategies might be effective in mitigating the ongoing SAV epidemic. Finally, genomic analyses of SAV sequences were performed, offering novel insights into the prevalence of SAV genomes containing defective deletions. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the recent transmission dynamics and biology of the SAV epidemic affecting Norwegian aquaculture.

AB  - This study concerns narratives and practices developed within landscape management in a Natura 2000 area in the south-west of Sweden. This European Union-funded project shifted focus from morphological and passive conservation management to intervening in biological management. I investigate some of the consequences of re-politicized discourses and practices during this period. I ask how a traditional policy view on conservation was handled during this change, and what role EU funding has in preserving or changing a traditional management policy for landscape conservation. The conclusions are that landscape protection is driven by political and ideological values connected with institutionalized aesthetic components that are adjusted to whatever disciplinary focus prevails at the time. However, traditional approaches are retained, excluding participatory methods and the social dimensions on landscape management. To some extent, the available EU funding leverages alignment of project goals and management, influencing landscape alteration.

AB  - A sequential monitoring programme for archaeological sites and monuments was started in Norway in 1997. The purpose of this ongoing monitoring was to produce more accurate figures for loss and damage and to detect long-term trends in loss/damage patterns. In this article we present the method used to document the sequential monitoring, the extent of and the most important causes of loss and damage to archaeological heritage, and we discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of the method used in this monitoring programme. The results so far point to agriculture as the single most important cause of loss, and together with housing and leisure it is also the most important cause of damage. In the large parts of Norway where agriculture is marginal and has been characterized by small farms and grass based livestock production, regrowth of fallow fields leads to cultural landscape change and the loss of archaeological sites.

AB  - We have investigated why conflicts linked to the distribution of power between governments and actors at the national and local levels concerning environmental management of mountain areas in Norway persist despite political intentions to strengthen local powers. We seek to explain this by analysing changes in policies, institutional frameworks, and regional contexts, and the local perceptions of these changes. Paradoxically, the national government's power has apparently been strengthened by new sectoral regulations and more stringent enforcement of the existing ones, increases in the number and extent of protected areas, and failures to act on intentions to devolve power. An additional factor spurring conflicts is the increased importance of tourism to mountain communities. To become more relevant to policies and development in mountain areas, future studies on multilevel governance must address multilevel politics, entire mountain areas, and the context of their development, rather than focusing on minor projects and protected areas.

AB  - Swedish institutes and organizations established agricultural research and development projects in the Baltic Sea region already in 1991. Activities have mainly been performed by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF), the Swedish Institute of Agricultural Engineering (JTI), and Agricultural Societies in Sweden. The main financiers have been BITS, Sida and the Swedish Institute. In research cooperation, NOVABA has played an important role. NOVABA is the organization for cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic agricultural universities in the above mentioned sector. Experience has shown that all projects must have a comprehensive view. Economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects must be observed simultaneously. The goals and ambitions for the environmental sector will probably fail if they are not followed-up by economic development. The major economic problem to be solved in the Baltic republics, Russia and Poland is how to stimulate privately owned farms, in order to attain sustainable agriculture. In this process local mobilization, business planning, local cooperation, and production combinations are key concepts.

AB  - P>A combination of radio and acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the out-migration of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in the River Testebo, its estuary and coastal system. As with many other Baltic rivers, the hydropower regulated River Testebo once had a self-sustaining salmon population that is now extinct. Substantial losses of smolts in the river (48-69%) and inner part of the estuary (43-47%) were found, but after leaving the estuary, the success of post-smolts moving out of the Bay was sufficiently high (83-89%) to conclude that habitat within the bay is not a factor limiting initial marine survival. The results suggest that hatchery-based recovery of a wild salmon population in the river will not be successful unless other actions, such as habitat improvement, are included.

AB  - In Finland, a recent ecological classification of surface waters showed that the rivers and coastal waters need attention to improve their ecological state. We combined eco-hydrological and empirical models to study chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication in a small agricultural river. We used a modified story-and-simulation method to build three storylines for possible changes in future land use due to climate change and political change. The main objective in the first storyline is to stimulate economic activity but also to promote the sustainable and efficient use of resources. The second storyline is based on the high awareness but poor regulation of environmental protection, and the third is to survive as individual countries instead of being part of a unified Europe. We assumed trade of agricultural products to increase to countries outside Europe. We found that chlorophyll-a concentration in the river depended on total phosphorus concentration. In addition, there was a positive synergistic interaction between total phosphorus and water temperature. In future storylines, chlorophyll-a concentration increased due to land use and climate change. Climate change mainly had an indirect influence via increasing nutrient losses from intensified agriculture. We found that well-designed agri-environmental measures had the potential to decrease nutrient loading from fields, as long as the predicted increase in temperature remained under 2 degrees C. However, we were not able to achieve the nutrient reduction stated in current water protection targets. In addition, the ecological status of the river deteriorated. The influence of temperature on chlorophyll-a growth indicates that novel measures for shading rivers to decrease water temperature may be needed in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Modern forestry during the last decades has strongly increased fragmentation of forest habitats. This may result in harmful effects on raptor species which are strictly dependent on boreal forests, such as the vole-eating Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus). The long-term data from Finland shows that in extensive forest areas, fledgling production of Boreal Owls is higher on intensively clear-cut territories than on less clear-cut territories. Breeding frequency, clutch size and laying date, however, have not been shown to be related to the proportion of clear-cut areas within a territory. Snap-trapping data suggests that large dear-cut areas sustain more Microtus voles than small clear-cut areas. The increased number of saplings and clear-cut areas during the last two or three decades has created new suitable grass habitats for Microtus voles, and simultaneously new hunting habitats for Boreal Owls. There is some experimental evidence that the presence of the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) decreases the breeding density of Boreal Owls within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. Therefore, forest fragmentation does not seem to harm Boreal Owls at the present day scare, but a lack of nest holes has to be compensated for by setting nest boxes far (>2 km) from medium-sized and large raptors that can prey upon the Boreal Owl. In the long-term, however, establishment of snags and patches of mature forests with large trees, dense enough to satisfy the ecology of the hole-nesting Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), will provide a natural way to establish new nesting cavities for Boreal Owls.

AB  - Wild bee populations are threatened by current agricultural practices in many parts of the world, which may put pollination services and crop yields at risk. Loss of pollination services can potentially be predicted by models that link bee abundances with landscape-scale land-use, but there is little knowledge on the degree to which these statistical models are transferable across time and space. This study assesses the transferability of models for wild bee abundance in a mass-flowering crop across space (from one region to another) and across time (from one year to another). The models used existing data on bumblebee and solitary bee abundance in winter oilseed rape fields, together with high-resolution land-use crop-cover and semi-natural habitats data, from studies conducted in five different regions located in four countries (Sweden, Germany, Netherlands and the UK), in three different years (2011, 2012, 2013). We developed a hierarchical model combining all studies and evaluated the transferability using cross-validation. We found that both the landscape-scale cover of mass-flowering crops and permanent semi-natural habitats, including grasslands and forests, are important drivers of wild bee abundance in all regions. However, while the negative effect of increasing mass-flowering crops on the density of the pollinators is consistent between studies, the direction of the effect of semi-natural habitat is variable between studies. The transferability of these statistical models is limited, especially across regions, but also across time. Our study demonstrates the limits of using statistical models in conjunction with widely available land-use crop-cover classes for extrapolating pollinator density across years and regions, likely in part because input variables such as cover of semi-natural habitats poorly capture variability in pollinator resources between regions and years.

AB  - Forests and forestry in many forms are instrumental in contributing positively to environmental, social and economic outcomes in New Zealand. However, simply increasing production or efficiency has not always realised positive benefits for communities. In a current programme on the East Coast of New Zealand, we are undertaking action research to develop culturally appropriate adaptive governance capacity in forest-dependent and rural communities. These communities do not necessarily want more intense or increased forest or agricultural production. They must manage the tensions inherent in an increase in forest and agricultural production, while dealing with severe erosion and a range of social, environmental, economic and cultural aspirations. The processes we are experimenting with are designed to understand land-use actors, their interests, networks and perceived challenges. Using this information, we apply adaptive governance and Kaupapa Maori principles to encourage collaboration and innovative thinking and decision-making. This work is innovative in that it has not been done before in New Zealand, can be scaled up and across contexts, and shift thinking away from traditional forest approaches (i.e. exotic monocultures) that have not worked. This paper will present the conceptual framework for this study and some preliminary results around empirical tools.

AB  - 1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway.
   2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area.
   3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.

AB  - Stakeholder inclusion in coastal zone management is part of the Norwegian fabric of inclusive government, and essential for the legitimacy of the distribution of coastal areas for a variety of uses. Norway is currently dependent upon the commitment and motivations of the municipalities to fulfil its ICZM initiatives. These municipalities in turn are dependent upon the goodwill of their constituents, among which are the fishers, for the distribution of area rights, especially when distributing to the aquaculture industry. In Froya, these fishers have seldom made complaints against possible aquaculture localities, and have usually supported the governing institutions when coastal allocations are made in favour of aquaculture. With the possibility of a forthcoming supersized offshore salmon aquaculture facility in an important crabbing area, however, these stakeholders have come to the end of their goodwill. The following paper explores the use of iterative stakeholder workshops as a management tool. Ensuring that stakeholders are included in the management process can provide legitimacy thereof and minimize conflict. Insisting on iterative stakeholder workshops or consultations in processes that span longer time periods demonstrates that managers also take into account that constituent opinions are dynamic, and not static, and need to be accounted for, which could further legitimize their later decisions.

AB  - 1. Studies, mainly from the UK, show that many farmland birds have declined as a result of recent agricultural intensification. We tested this idea by analysing farmland bird population trends in Sweden, a country displaying less dramatic agricultural changes and less intensive agriculture. Specifically we investigated whether (i) farmland specialists have declined more than generalists, (ii) population declines in Sweden are less marked than in England and (iii) Swedish population trends are associated with changes in the amount of autumn-sown crops, and inputs of pesticides and fertilizers.
   2. Data on population trends for 21 farmland bird species collected from the Swedish Breeding Bird Survey 1976-2001 were analysed in relation to agricultural changes in Sweden.
   3. Fifteen (71%) farmland bird species declined significantly in number (P < 0.05) over the 26 years. Farmland specialists displayed a significantly stronger average decline (55%) as a group than farmland generalists (7%). For seven species the declines were significantly steeper between 1976 and 1988 than between 1988 and 2001.
   4. Farmland bird populations have declined at least as much in Sweden as in England. Several specialist species displayed similar temporal patterns in population change in both countries.
   5. The area of autumn-sown crops has remained stable in Sweden, whereas use of pesticides and fertilizers has declined. There are no clear associations between these factors and observed farmland bird population declines.
   6. The similarities in bird population trends in Sweden and England, despite large differences in patterns of agricultural change in Sweden and England, may be explained by: (i) common wintering grounds, (ii) similar negative effects of agricultural intensification (England) and intensification/abandonment (Sweden) and (iii) a simultaneous loss of landscape heterogeneity.
   7. Synthesis and applications. Farmland birds in Sweden have declined by at least as much as in England, despite clear differences between the two countries in the degree of agricultural intensification over the last 30 years. We suggest that the marked declines in Swedish populations are caused by (i) the dual negative effects of intensification and abandonment of farmland at breeding grounds, and (ii) Swedish populations partly sharing wintering grounds with English populations. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes need to be flexible enough to address the negative effects both of intensification and the abandonment of farming. In addition, our results emphasize that farmland bird conservation is an issue without country borders.

AB  - As in many other policy areas, there is a rising concern about how to involve the general public in heritage management and preservation. We analyse attempts made by Swedish cultural heritage authorities to initiate new participatory devices. We ask: How is storytelling used as a participatory device? What are the implications of this in terms of how legitimate concerns are reconfigured? Storytelling has a capacity to transform dominant discourses and result in new objects of care. We conclude that even storytelling itself is reconfigured in these practices, resulting in the collection of narratives, with limited transformative effects.

AB  - There is growing consensus about the need to develop sustainable use of forest resources, but no consensus about how to interpret and implement this goal. Political institutions, governmental agencies, forest companies, and environmental organizations have partly different views on what sustainable forestry means and what strategies to use to achieve it. Not least, the climate change issue has put higher and partly new demands on forests, both as providers of biomass and as carbon sinks, which may be in conflict with other services of the forest's ecosystem. This paper analyses how different Swedish stakeholders evaluate the possibilities for intensive forestry, that is, to increase the production of woody biomass through increased use of fertilizers, improved genetic material, the introduction of exotic tree species, and the use of fast-growing deciduous tree species. The analysis shows that the pros and cons are evaluated differently, with some stakeholders assessing intensive forestry as a radical break from the current goal of sustainable forestry and others viewing it as according with it. It is concluded that this conflict should be understood as concerning not competing knowledge claims, but competing frames - schemes of interpretation through which the complexity of reality is reduced. This means that the solution is not to be found in improved knowledge but in increased awareness that the involved frames are the source of the conflict.

AB  - Loss of large carnivore populations may lead to increased population densities of large herbivores, and subsequent cascading effects on the composition, structure, and function of ecosystems. Using a macroecological approach based on studies in multiple boreal forest landscapes in the Baltic Sea region and Russia, we tested the hypothesis that disrupted trophic interactions among large carnivores and large herbivores affect the recruitment of both ecologically and economically valuable tree species. We measured damage levels on young trees and large herbivore density in 10 local landscapes representing a gradient from extinct to extant populations of both large carnivores and large herbivores. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that forest management intensity is correlated to reduced recruitment of these tree species. At the macroecological scale there was an inverse relationship between the number of large carnivores and large herbivores. This coincided with a steep gradient in browsing damage on the ecologically important aspen, rowan and sallow as hosts for specialized species, as well as the economically important Scots pine. In one landscape hunting had replaced the presence of carnivores. Mean damage levels of these four tree species were correlated with large herbivore abundance, but not with forest management intensity. We discuss the pros and cons of this macroecological approach, as well as the challenge of governing and managing trophic interactions at multiple scales.

AB  - Asia, particularly China, has become an attractive market that receives much attention in the Norwegian tourism industry. This raises relevant questions about the sustainability of the Chinese tourism boom. If the Norwegian tourism industry increasingly targets this rapidly growing market with larger investments, it should respond to the prospects of long-term growth. Such prospects hinge on the economic drivers behind the influx of Chinese tourists. In this study, we use both descriptive data analysis and the ARDL model to investigate the main economic factors that drive Chinese tourists to Norway. Specifically, we investigate whether the boom of the Chinese tourists is a relatively stable trend associated with the growing Chinese economy or just a short-term phenomenon brought by the weakened NOK. Our findings suggest instead of the well-recognized Chinese economic growth, it is the improving price competitiveness of Norway resulting from the weakening Norwegian kroner that has made the boom of the Chinese tourists in Norway. This result suggests although the income effect is significant in affecting aggregate tourist flow from a source country, for a single destination, price competitiveness is the key to make a destination attractive since the substitution effects of other destinations are huge and the income effect becomes uncertain.

AB  - New tools are needed to evaluate the impacts of short-term hydropower regulation practices on downstream river systems and to progress towards sustainable river-flow management. As hydropower is increasingly being used to balance the energy load deficit caused by other less flexible sources, sub-daily flow conditions across many regulated river (RR) systems are changing. To address this, we used wavelet analyses to quantify the discharge variability in RRs and categorized the level of variability based on the conditions in natural free-flowing rivers. The presented framework used the definition of fluvial connectivity (Grill et al., 2019) to identify free-flowing rivers used in the study. We tested the developed framework in 12 different RRs in Finland and found higher overall averaged sub-daily variations, with up to 20 times larger variability than natural conditions. A large, highly regulated Finnish river system was found to have the highest sub-daily variations in winter, while smaller RRs with lower levels of regulation the highest variations in summer. The proposed framework offers a novel tool for sustainable river management and can be easily applied to various rivers and regions globally. It had flexibility to analyze sub-daily variations in desired seasonal or other ecologically sensitive periods.

AB  - Adaptive governance is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the interaction of locally driven collaborative efforts with a hierarchy of governmental regulation and management and is thought to be capable of navigating social-ecological change as society responds to the effects of climate change. The assertion of Native American water rights on highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar innovations are observed in the assertion of Indigenous voices in Australia. This presents an opportunity to analyze the emergence of adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any system of governance that requires greater flexibility will only be viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance. Through examples of the assertion of Indigenous rights, we illustrate critical links between adaptive capacity in water management, good governance, and law.

AB  - Various restoration projects intended to mitigate the adverse ecological effects of hydropower plants, e.g. by restoration of fish habitats and spawning grounds, have been implemented in different parts of the world. However, it is unclear whether these projects are in line with least-cost principles. In this study, we estimated the cost efficiency level for different biodiversity mitigation measures in Sweden by using stochastic frontier analysis with data from 245 projects in Sweden that were carried out between 1987 and 2013. The results indicated evidence of cost inefficiency in the projects, which had an average efficiency score of 53%, suggesting a potential to reduce costs by 47%. Project ownership by private entities compared with municipalities showed a statistically significant reduction of the cost inefficiency score. This points out a possibility of reducing the total cost of restoration by targeting relatively efficient project owners.

AB  - This paper explores challenges and possibilities for integrating goals of long-term sustainable development into urban planning practice, with a specific focus on local institutional conditions for sustainability transitions. The analysis is based on a qualitative single case study of a large urban development process: the development of a new city district in Hyllie in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Hyllie was branded as a flagship project for sustainable urban development, with particularly high ambitions on climate neutrality and sustainable energy consumption. Several innovative elements were initiated in the development process, for instance the "climate contract" between the municipality and large energy companies. In the paper, this climate contract is discussed as an initiative with a promising potential for sustainability transitions. In practice, however, the outcome of the development in Hyllie in terms of sustainable development is ambiguous, since the district is also framed around luxury shopping, entertainment, and an ambition to attract visitors from a long distance. The Hyllie development illustrates pre-requisites for work on sustainable development in a decentralized and market-oriented planning context. Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by the multi-level perspective (MLP) and institutional theory. The results illustrate how the development process was shaped by a complex interplay between actors with differing agendas and targets at different stages in the process. These results are applied in a general discussion of challenges and possibilities for urban planning to contribute substantially to a transition to long-term sustainable development. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the importance of considering specific local institutional conditions in strategic work for long-term sustainability.

AB  - Ice often complicates shipping in extremely cold regions, leading to energy-consuming, expensive transportation. Ship performance can be significantly improved with icebreaking assistance that uses specialized ships called icebreakers to create navigable pathways in ice fields. Icebreakers are a critical and expensive resource with high energy consumption that must be judiciously utilized for efficient traffic flow. Optimizing icebreaker usage requires careful consideration of multiple factors related to weather, ships, and regulations. The existing decision support tools for icebreaker management primarily aim to minimize the total waiting time of ships, which may result in allocation of excess icebreakers. The paper presents a novel simulation-based approach for decarbonizing shipping in ice by intelligent icebreaking assistance. The proposed approach optimizes icebreaker assistance for both eco-and cost efficiency, allowing for more sustainable icebreaking policies. A case study representing a simplified configuration of the Finnish-Swedish Winter Navigation System demonstrates this approach to come up with alternate operating strategies that can significantly improve the emission and/or cost (e.g., up to 7 percent less greenhouse gas emission or up to 14.2% lower costs). Results show that the proposed approach is promising, for providing recommendations on environmental and economic policies to decarbonize the Finnish Swedish icebreaking assistance.

AB  - Responses to future changes in climatic and socio-economic conditions can be expected to vary between sectors and regions, reflecting differential sensitivity to these highly uncertain factors. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using a suite of impact models (for health, agriculture, biodiversity, land use, floods and forestry) across Europe with respect to changes in key climate and socio-economic variables. Depending on the indicators, aggregated grid or indicative site results are reported for eight rectangular sub-regions that together span Europe from northern Finland to southern Spain and from western Ireland to the Baltic States and eastern Mediterranean, each plotted as scenario-neutral impact response surfaces (IRSs). These depict the modelled behaviour of an impact variable in response to changes in two key explanatory variables. To our knowledge, this is the first time the IRS approach has been applied to changes in socio-economic drivers and over such large regions. The British Isles region showed the smallest sensitivity to both temperature and precipitation, whereas Central Europe showed the strongest responses to temperature and Eastern Europe to precipitation. Across the regions, sensitivity to temperature was lowest for the two indicators of river discharge and highest for Norway spruce productivity. Sensitivity to precipitation was lowest for intensive agricultural land use, maize and potato yields and Scots pine productivity, and highest for Norway spruce productivity. Under future climate projections, North-eastern Europe showed increases in yields of all crops and productivity of all tree species, whereas Central and East Europe showed declines. River discharge indicators and forest productivity (except Holm oak) were projected to decline over southern European regions. Responses were more sensitive to socio-economic than to climate drivers for some impact indicators, as demonstrated for heat-related mortality, coastal flooding and land use.

AB  - The sustainable development of cities is threatened by a worldwide water crisis. Improved social learning is urgently needed to transform urban water governance and make it more integrated and adaptive. However, empirical studies remain few and fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how social learning has supported or inhibited sustainable transformations in urban water governance. On the basis of multiple case studies conducted in urban, flood-prone areas in Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, India, and Sweden, we study learning processes related to different aspects of water management and governance. Our results show that transformations in water governance are often triggered by crises, whereas other potentials for transformation are not tapped into. Furthermore, learning is often inhibited by "lock-ins" created by powerful actors. We conclude that there is a need for more proactive design of governance structures for triple-loop learning that take into account the identified barriers and supporting principles.

AB  - More than ever, state agencies responsible for forest issues are required to balance the social, economic and environmental demands on forests in domestic and international spheres. New and often crosscutting issues may threaten the position and power of traditional forest bureaucracies through, e.g., a redistribution of power among a number of other land-use-related state agencies. This paper analyzes the absolute and relative power of the Ministry of Forestry (MoF) in two selected policy processes originating on the international and domestic levels, namely the REDD+ Programme and the One Map Policy. Building on a behavioralist conception of power and bureaucratic politics theories, we study these processes to reveal the power dynamics between the MoF and other state bureaucracies, based mainly on documents on tasks assigned to these bureaucracies. Our results show a clear decline in the relative power of the MoF, most notably in the case of incentive and coercive power, though we also show a continuation of power resulting from dominant information. However, due to political intervention from the new president, traditional forest bureaucracy is now reclaiming most of relative power elements in these cases. We discuss the core findings and conclude that both REDD+ and the One Map Policy are likely to become effective policies only if the bureaucratic, sectoral and multi-level conflicts of interest we examine are addressed and fewer leading agencies (or one) assume responsibility for policy formulation and implementation.

AB  - The aim of this article is to reflect on the opportunities of urban form to promote non-vehicular transportation in the planning and implementation of the sustainable housing settlement 'Broset' in Trondheim, Norway. One of Broset's goals is to create a housing environment that makes it easy for residents to choose forms of transportation other than the private car, thereby reducing transportation-related emissions. Previous research regarding the relevance of urban parameters on transport choice and on supporting non-vehicular transportation is reviewed. Aspects such as residential density, accessibility or distances are discussed as elements that influence travel behaviour. We will reflect on the implications given by previous studies in order to identify factors that are relevant to our case study. We also present an analysis of the current situation and discuss which measures may contribute to increasing the use of non-vehicular transportation at Broset. In conclusion, the analysis shows that none of the urban elements that are usually associated with increasing non-vehicular transportation have been satisfactorily developed at Broset at the moment. The analysis points out the challenges of creating a sustainable housing settlement in a suburban location.

AB  - The current Norwegian climate research structures, policies and priorities, mitigation and adaptation options are discussed as well as the development of local climate change projections and adaptation measures. A major difficulty is that Norway's present energy supply has a low carbon intensity because a substantial part derives from hydropower, but increasing demand may be met by gas-fired electricity generation, thereby making efficiency and conservation a much higher priority. A National Action Plan on Climate Research recognizes the need for increased research efforts in several areas, including the impacts on the built environment and the more general impacts on society. Mitigation opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the built environment include increased technological efficiencies, reduced energy usage through improved design, mandatory labelling schemes and a switch to climate neutral fuels for heating. However, radically lower energy requirements and lower U-values will be problematic, requiring new technical solutions and construction methods. There is little integration of policy and strategy for adaptation in Norway. The recognition that climate change will further enhance an array of different, harsh microclimates in Norway, which vary according to individual locality, has led to the development of new adaptation approaches and methods. These allow for the projected local climate to inform decisions on an appropriate design response to meet performance-based codes. The development of design guidance for high-performance building envelopes will, in future, take account of projected local climate. However, there is a tension between the need for standardized national building solutions and the need to adapt to local climatic conditions.

AB  - National goals regarding sustainable development from the Swedish government were decisive in the planning process when the newly built city district Western Harbour was established in the city of Malmo, Sweden. A systems analysis was used as a tool for evaluating different collection and treatment systems. This type of analysis does not include more subjective factors such as acceptance of organic fertilisers based on human waste and user acceptance of collection schemes. These aspects, however, will often determine the success of a technical solution. When the system for collection and treatment of solid organic waste and wastewater was designed, both subjective and objective factors were considered. This meant that a centralised solution for wastewater treatment was selected. In order to facilitate a more sustainable solution for sludge management a treatment process with recovery of phosphorus will have to be introduced. Organic waste is sorted out and treated in an anaerobic digestion process. Source sorting of solid organic waste has been difficult to implement in Sweden due to inadequate sorting discipline. As a consequence two relatively new systems are tested in the area. A comprehensive evaluation will be carried out during a period of two years.

AB  - Many climate adaptation options currently being discussed in Sweden to meet the challenge of surging seas and inland flooding advocate holding the line through various hard and soft measures to stabilize the shoreline, while managed retreat is neither considered as feasible option nor has it been explicitly researched in Sweden. However, failure to consider future flooding from climate change in municipal planning may have dangerous and costly consequences when the water does come. We suggest that managed retreat practices are challenging in Sweden, not only due to public opinions but also because of a deficit of uptake of territorial knowledge by decision-makers and difficulties in realizing flexible planning options of the shoreline. A territorial governance framework was used as a heuristic to explore the challenges to managed retreat in four urban case studies (three municipalities and one county) representing different territorial, hydrological and oceanographic environments. This was done through a series of participatory stakeholder workshops. The analysis using a territorial governance framework based on dimensions of coordination, integration, mobilization, adaptation and realization presents variations in how managed retreat barriers and opportunities are perceived among case study sites, mainly due to the differing territorial or place-based challenges. The results also indicate common challenges regardless of the case study site, including coordination challenges and unclear responsibility, the need for integrated means of addressing goal conflicts and being able to adapt flexibly to existing regulations and plans. Yet rethinking how managed retreat could boost community resilience and help to implement long-term visions was seen as a way to deal with some of the territorial challenges.

AB  - Eco-town developments have been the testing grounds to improve upon the urban policies and practices in the Northern and Western European countries since the early 1990s. It has been widely discussed as to whether or how they have helped transitioning of towns and cities into more sustainable systems in the larger urban context through educational, experiential, societal diffusion and changes in governance processes. The countries in different cultural and geographical contexts with rapid urbanization rates, seek to establish similar developments with relatively less knowledge of the contextual and procedural differences in the eco-towns' processes or the reasons for their varying levels of impact. This article was prepared to summarize and systematize the insights that have been obtained from 'eco-town' based urban developments implemented in the Northwestern Europe with particular emphasis given into the examples from The Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. The review of the relevant literature was conducted with the focus on: a. the context in which the demonstration eco-towns were developed since the emergence of planned communities in the early 20th century, b. the typologies, processes and frameworks through which the eco-towns were initiated, built, governed and evolved. The authors analyzed the wide diversity of frameworks and processes that have played roles in the relative successes and/or failures. The review provided insights into their procedures and the aspects associated with the diffusion of the lessons into the broader urban planning and development methods. The findings suggested that the political commitment, timing, financial aspects, physical qualities, stakeholder involvement and environmental planning were key elements in achieving the eco-towns' goals. Future research is recommended to critically analyze the impacts of these historically new urban development models and frameworks in order to create more effective approaches for achieving positive outcomes for all societies within ecological boundaries.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) was studied in old Pinus sylvestris L. dominated forests in three geographic regions in the middle boreal vegetation zone: (i) in Hame in southwestern Finland. characterized by a long history of forest utilization, (ii) in Kuhmo in northeastern Finland. with a more recent history of forest utilization, and (iii) in the Vienansalo wilderness area in northwestern Russia. characterized by large areas of almost natural forest. Within the geographic regions the measured 0.2-ha plots were divided into three stand types according to the degree of human impact: (i) natural stands, (ii) selectively logged stands, and (iii) managed stands. The result,, showed that compared with natural forests, forest management has strongly reduced both the amount and diversity of CWD. The highest total CWD volumes were found in the natural stands in Hame (mean 67 m(3).ha(-1)) and Kuhmo (92 m(3).ha(-1)) arid in the selective logged stands in Vienansalo (80 m(3).ha(-1)), while the lowest CWD volumes were found in the managed stands in Hame (7 m(3).ha(-1)) and Kuhmo (22 m(3).ha(-1)). The duration of forest utilization also plays a role. as forests with short management histories (Kuhmo region) still carried structural legacies from earlier more natural stages of the forest. In addition to lower total CWD volumes, managed stands also largely lacked certain dead wood characteristics. particularly large dead trees and standing dead trees with structural diversity characteristics (such as stein breakage, leaning stems, and fire scars) when compared with natural and selectively logged stands. The CWD characteristics of stands selectively logged in the past were often comparable with those of natural stands, suggesting that old selectively logged stands can be of high value from the nature conservation point of view.

AB  - The widely used even-age management including small and uniformly sized regeneration areas together with the small-patterned private ownership are major features reshaping the Finnish forest structure. The object of the study was to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of a real transforming forest landscape that consists of several privately owned management units. A forest area of ca. 9600 ha in the 1940s, 1960s and 1990s was used in the study. The effect of harvesting was examined by classifying the forest land into no-canopy and closed-canopy classes. No-canopy areas include both harvested and naturally open areas. Closed-canopy areas include development stages of young, middle-aged, mature and old forests. Different spatial scales were investigated by sampling the landscape with square windows. Largest patch index (LPI), mean patch size (MPS), area-weighted mean shape index (AWMSI) and edge density (ED) were calculated for the no-canopy class as an average of the sampled squares at the selected scales. Investigation of landscape metrics and their variability at several scales was more informative than averaging the entire landscape into a single index at a given scale. The study shows that forest management has clearly changed the structure of forest landscape in private forests during the time span under investigation. Presently, the changes caused by forestry take place at very fine scales, and therefore small sampling units are useful for the study of landscape structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Norway has a complex, even paradoxical, relationship to the United Nations Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. It makes considerable financial contributions to the United Nations and has strongly supported the establishment of the sustainability agenda aimed at promoting global equity and mitigating the ecological and climate crises. Norway is also a prominent petroleum-producing nation. The Norwegian position is explored using an approach that emphasizes justice and education in the sustainability agenda. Three key texts are studied. The first is the objectives clause in the Education Act, the second is an address by then prime minister Erna Solberg at the annual conference of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, and the third are educational assignments published by the Norwegian Petroleum Museum addressing sustainability and climate change. What is decisive is how specific facets of justice are emphasized in ways that detach Norway from tensions, contradictions, and dilemmas involved.

AB  - Long term monitoring data from 1981 - 2000 was used to study nitrogen (N) losses from a small (15.4 km(2)) agricultural catchment in southern Finland. The annual loads of total N, NO3-N and NH4-N varied considerably during the study period. The mean total N load was 820 kg km(-2) yr(-1). More than half of the annual N load was in the form of NO3-N, while the relative contribution of NH4-N was low, which is common in Finnish agricultural fine-textured soils. The measured annual N loads were highly dependent on runoff. The highest annual N load (1310 kg km(-2)) was observed in 1984, in accordance with the highest annual runoff (616 mm). Due to mild weather conditions during the winters since 1989, the relative proportion of winter runoff was higher than earlier. So far, no decrease could be seen in annual N loads, even though most of the farmers are participating in the Finnish Agri- Environmental Programme established in 1995. However, the amount of NH4-N load seems to have remained very low (less than 50 kg km(-2) yr(-1)) in Savijoki since 1995, which may reflect changes in agricultural practices and a decrease in N deposition.

AB  - The planning of energy ambitious neighborhood pilots in Norway typically begin with the creation of holistic and socially ambitious visions based on extensive stakeholder collaboration, citizen insight generation and vision setting. However, as projects move from planning to implementation, the exploratory innovation methods are replaced by exploitative approaches. The holistic vision and in particular, citizens' described needs, fail to transfer into the implementation phase. This paper identifies four main challenges as to why this happens and link these to theory on ambidextrous organizations that need to exploit existing knowledge while reaching into the future with its rapidly changing goals and technological opportunities. Implementing stakeholders are familiar with exploitative tools, which build on earlier experience and capabilities of the selected implementing stakeholders, and the implementation stage leaves little time and resources for innovation on a lower hierarchical level. While extensive research on smart and integrated planning focus on 'breaking down the silos' meaning sectors and disciplines, our findings argue that the need to manage ambidextrous organizations and support both exploratory and exploitative innovation is equally important. An ambidextrous organization is one that has the ability to be efficient in its management of today's business while being adaptable for coping with the changing demand of tomorrow. We propose a model in which the organizational style and management style of innovative neighborhood pilots focus more on how to transfer knowledge and learn from the bottom-up and horizontally through management that foster both innovation models.

AB  - Retention forestry, including the retention of woodland key habitats (WKH) at the forest stand scale, has become an essential management practice in boreal forests. Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of 9470 habitat patches, mapped according to the Complementary Habitat Inventory method (CHI habitats), as potential WKHs in 10 sample areas in Norway. We ask whether there are parts of the forest landscapes that have consistently low or high density of CHI habitats compared to the surveyed landscape as a whole, and therefore have a low or high degree of conflict with harvesting, respectively. We found that there was a general pattern of clumped distribution of CHI habitats at distances up to a few kilometres. Furthermore, results showed that most types of CHI habitats were approximately two to three times as common in the 25% steepest slopes, lowest altitudes and highest site indices. CHI habitats that are most common in old-growth forests were found at longer distances from roads, whereas habitats rich in deciduous trees were found at shorter distances from roads than expected. Both environmental factors and the history of human impact are needed to explain the spatial distribution of CHI habitats. The overrepresentation of WKHs in parts of the forest landscapes represents a good starting point to develop more efficient inventory methods.

AB  - Differences in the way local and regional interest groups perceive Sustainable Forest Management in regions with different forest use histories were studied using Southeastern Finland, the Mauricie in Quebec and Central Labrador in Canada as examples of regions with high, medium and low importance of commercial forestry. We present a conceptual model illustrating the cyclic interaction between the forest, cultural models about forests and forest management. We hypothesized that peoples' perceptions would be influenced by their cultural models about forests and would thus vary amongst regions with different forest use histories and among different interest groups. The weightings of the environmental, economic and social components of sustainability as well as themes important for each of the interest groups were elicited using individual listing of SFM indicators and group work aimed at developing a consensus opinion on a common indicator list. In Southeastern Finland the views of the different groups were polarized along the environment-economy axis, whereas in Central Labrador all groups were environmentally oriented. The social dimension was low overall except among the Metis and the Innu in Labrador. Only environmental groups were similar in all three research regions, the largest differences between regions were found among the forestry professionals in their weightings concerning economy and nature. As the importance of commercial forestry increased, a greater importance of economic issues was expressed whereas the opposite trend was observed for issues regarding nature. Also inter-group differences grew as the importance of commercial forestry increased in the region. Forest management and forest use can be seen as factors strongly influencing peoples' cultural models on forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We aim to assess habitat and host-tree preferences of psocids (Insecta: Psocoptera) sampled in old-growth-forest biodiversity studies conducted during 1997-2003 in central and southern Finland. Thirty-one out of the recognized sixty-nine Finnish species were found in the samples, four of which (Elipsocus abdominalis, Reuterella helvimacula, Stenopsocus lachlani and Trichade-notecnum majus) might be associated with old-growth forests or with old trees. Psocidus flavonimbatus, a rare taiga species only previously known from the 19(th) century holotype from Estonia, was repeatedly collected in Kuhmo region, eastern Central Finland. This species is possibly associated with boreal spruce-dominated old-growth forests and likely to prefer Norway spruce as a host tree. We also provide new distribution data for several species and discuss their host-tree preferences.

AB  - Since the late 1990 s, biodiversity mapping has been a key instrument for preventing loss of species and habitats in Norwegian productive forests. Having major implications for the abilities of actors to pursue their interests in practical forest management, the methodologies of biodiversity mapping have been highly controversial and contested. We identify two different forest ontologies, or realities, that were enacted by the two main competing methodologies for such mapping. The methodologies, SiS and EiF, were supported by what we term the environmental and the forestry segments, respectively. Whereas a mapping approach associated with the environmental segment enacted a varied and complex forest ontology, a mapping approach related to the forestry segment enacted a comprehensible and more standardized forest ontology. In analyzing the two ontologies, we explore the links between the configuration of the mapping methodologies and 1) the forest realities they enact, 2) the scientific ideals they advocate, and 3) the relationship between mapping and management decisions. In particular, we argue that the ontologies have different political implications, generally favoring the actors that support them. On a more general level, we show that ontological politics is performed in the enactment of different ontologies related to different political segments, associated with different sectors.

AB  - In agricultural catchments, hydrological processes are highly linked to particle and nutrient loss and can lead to a degradation of the ecological status of the water. Global warming and land use changes influence the hydrological regime. This effect is especially strong in cold regions. In this study, we used long-term hydrological monitoring data (22-26 years) from small agricultural catchments in Norway. We applied a Mann-Kendall trend and wavelet coherence analysis to detect annual and seasonal changes and to evaluate the coupling between runoff, climate, and water sources. The trend analysis showed a significant increase in the annual and seasonal mean air temperature. In all sites, hydrological changes were more difficult to detect. Discharge increased in autumn and winter, but this trend did not hold for all catchments. We found a strong coherence between discharge and precipitation, between discharge and snow water equivalent and discharge and soil water storage capacity. We detected different hydrological regimes of rain and snow-dominated catchments. The catchments responded differently to changes due to their location and inherent characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of studying local annual and seasonal changes in hydrological regimes to understand the effect of climate and the importance for site-specific management plans.

AB  - The SW coast of the Barents ea is a historical transition zone between the traditional agrarian cultures of western Europe and ami hunter-gatherers of northern Fennoscandia. It is today north of the climatic limit of cereal cultivation and the economy is primarily based on fisheries. The pollen content of two peat profiles from the outer coastal island Soroya (c. 70.5 degrees N) were examined. Increased anthropogenic influence was seen in the pollen assemblages at 600-100 BC, Ad 150-550, AD 1300-1550 and AD 1700-2000, as well as a general environmental shift around AD 950, probably towards a wetter climate and more open vegetation. The results largely confirm the general held view on agrarian expansion phases in North Norway. These different phases are discussed from a regional, historical, economic and environmental perspective. During the early Iron Age the arctic limit for agriculture is extended northward along the coast into the Barents Sea area, probably during periods of more favourable climate. From the late Middle Ages onwards the development towards an efficient market economy allowed better exploitation of the marine recourses, which reduced the dependence on climatically sensitive agrarian activities.

AB  - The browning of surface waters due to the increased terrestrial loading of dissolved organic carbon is observed across the northern hemisphere. Brownification is often explained by changes in large-scale anthropogenic pressures (including acidification, and climate and land-use changes). We quantified the effect of environmental changes on the brownification of an important lake for birds, Kukkia in southern Finland. We studied the past trends of organic carbon loading from catchments based on observations taken since the 1990s. We created hindcasting scenarios for deposition, climate and land-use change in order to simulate their quantitative effect on brownification by using process-based models. Changes in forest cuttings were shown to be the primary reason for the brownification. According to the simulations, a decrease in deposition has resulted in a slightly lower leaching of total organic carbon (TOC). In addition, runoff and TOC leaching from terrestrial areas to the lake was smaller than it would have been without the observed increasing trend in temperature by 2 & DEG;C in 25 years.

AB  - Golf courses are often considered to be chemical-intensive ecosystems with negative impacts on fauna. Here we provide evidence that golf courses can contribute to the support and conservation of wetland fauna, i.e., amphibians and macroinvertebrates. Comparisons of amphibian occurrence, diversity of macroinvetebrates, and occurrence of species of conservation concern were made between permanent freshwater ponds surveyed on golf courses around Sweden's capital city, Stockholm, and off-course ponds in nature-protected areas and residential parklands. A total of 71 macroinvertebrate species were recorded in the field study, with no significant difference between golf course ponds and off-course ponds at the species, genus, or family levels. A within-group similarities test showed that golf course ponds have a more homogenous species composition than ponds in nature-protected areas and ponds in residential parkland. Within the macroinvertebrate group, a total of 11 species of odonates were identified, with no difference detected between the categories of ponds, nor any spatial autocorrelation. Significant differences were found between pond categories in the occurrence of five species of amphibians, although anuran occurrence did not differ between ponds. The great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) was significantly associated with golf course ponds, but the smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) was not. We found no evidence of any correlation between pond size and occurrence of amphibians. Among the taxa of conservation concern included in the sample, all amphibians are nationally protected in Sweden, with the internationally threatened T. cristatus more frequently found in golf course ponds. Among macroinveterbrates of conservation status, the large white-faced darter dragonfly (Leucorrhinia pectoralis) was only detected in golf course ponds, and Tricholeiochiton fagesi (Trichoptera) was only found in one off-course pond. GIS results revealed that golf courses provide over a quarter of all available permanent, freshwater ponds in central greater Stockholm. We assert that golf courses have the potential to contribute to wetland fauna support, particularly in urban settings where they may significantly contribute to wetland creation. We propose a greater involvement of ecologists in the design of golf courses to further bolster this potential.

AB  - In a Swedish context, public authorities have, over the past 10 years, implemented a number of initiatives to make art a central part of not only sustainable development but also urban planning as a practice, process, and knowledge area. Art and artistic methods are seen to contribute with new methods for site analyses (often in combination with citizen involvement) to enhance embodied and situated knowledge and give space to critical reflection. One of the Swedish initia-tives is called Art Is Happening. Between 2016 and 2018, the Swedish government assigned the Public Art Agency Sweden money to work with public art and citizen inclusion in million program areas. The initiative was framed as using artistic methods to strengthen democracy in areas with low turnout. Fifteen places around the country were selected. In this arti-cle, the focus is on one of those projects in Karlskrona, where an artist collaborated with citizens to create a public artwork and local meeting place. During the process, the artist partly lived in the area. Rather than discussing the artistic project from a binary logic as disempowerment/empowerment, consensual/agonistic, and political/antipolitical, it is examined as a process involving a mixture of both, where power unfolded in ways that were both problematic and valuable at the same time. This approach moves away from "good or bad" to a nuanced way of discussing how artistic methods can contribute to understandings of situated knowledge production in urban planning.

AB  - The effects of climatic changes, progressing urbanization and improved environmental controls on the simulated urban stormwater quality in a northern Sweden community were studied. Future scenarios accounting for those changes were developed and their effects simulated with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). It was observed that the simulated stormwater quality was highly sensitive to the scenarios, mimicking progressing urbanization with varying catchment imperviousness and area. Thus, land use change was identified as one of the most influential factors and in some scenarios, urban growth caused changes in runoff quantity and quality exceeding those caused by a changing climate. Adaptation measures, including the reduction of directly connected impervious surfaces (DCIS) through the integration of more green spaces into the urban landscape, or disconnection of DCIS were effective in reducing runoff volume and pollutant loads. Furthermore, pollutant source control measures, including material substitution, were effective in reducing pollutant loads and significantly improving stormwater quality.

AB  - This investigation compared health visiting in Scotland and Norway by focusing on health visitors' influence on management matters, work tasks and work conditions. The data are based upon in-depth interviews with nine health visitors from Scotland and 12 health visitors from Norway. The results showed more similarities than differences between the Scottish and Norwegian health visitors. Both groups experienced autonomy at work. The hardships of work were the lack of visibility for their work and an inability to demonstrate in measurable ways the effect of their work. Issues related to lack of time and priority of the newborn and young children were also similar as well as the experience of insecurity and strain at work. The differences were mostly within the area of organizational structure and its influence on management matters. While the Norwegian HV participated in plans for the service, employment and budget proposals, the Scottish HV was involved in these matters to a lesser degree. All in all, the similarity of the themes and the comparable units suggest the core of health visiting extends beyond the limits of cultural and national boundaries.

AB  - In recent decades there has been a marked decline in most ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana populations in temperate Europe, with many regional populations now extinct or on the brink of extinction. In contrast, Mediterranean and, as far as we know, eastern European populations seem to have remained relatively stable. The causes of decline remain unclear but include: habitat loss and degradation, and related reduction in prey availability; climate change on the breeding grounds; altered population dynamics; illegal captures during migration; and environmental change in wintering areas. We review the current knowledge of the biology of the ortolan bunting and discuss the proposed causes of decline in relation to the different population trends in temperate and Mediterranean Europe. We suggest new avenues of research to identify the factors limiting ortolan bunting populations. The main evidence-based conservation measure that is likely to enhance habitat quality is the creation of patches of bare ground to produce sparsely vegetated foraging grounds in invertebrate-rich grassy habitats close to breeding areas.

AB  - Due to generally high discard rates in Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) fisheries, a discard ban coming up and to the cod recovery plan in several areas, selective sorting grids have been tested in many areas and are specified by legislation for use in the Kattegat and Skagerrak area bordering Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Grids are very selective, but they can lead to loss of landable Norway lobster and valuable fish species. To improve retention of these species, we developed three new grids using made by polyurethane to make them flexible: One grid had horizontal bars, one had vertical bars, and one had vertical bars and a guiding funnel in front of the grid. Four unselective net bags were used to collect the catch escaping through different parts of the grid or escaping without passing through the grid. Water flow around the grid bars was measured in a flume tank. The three grids were tested from a commercial trawler in the Kattegat and Skagerrak area. Underwater filming was conducted to assess grid performance and fish behavior. Results showed that a bottom hole in the lower part of the grid allowed species in the lower part of the gear to pass and retained in the bag behind the hole. More flatfish passed the grid with horizontal bars compared to that with vertical bars, but the retention rate was still low. Use of the guiding funnel increased the contact with the grid considerably for both target and unwanted species. In all three grid designs, there were losses of Norway lobster above minimum landing size. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Around the world, there is a growing emphasis on developing the aquaculture industry in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner and this is the case also in Norway and Ireland. The impact of aquaculture on the environment is currently evaluated by the use of a set of indicators focusing mainly on physical and chemical parameters, while to date social acceptance has not been integrated fully into aquaculture sustainability evaluation. With this in mind, this paper examines the public attitudes of the Irish and Norwegian general public to marine aquaculture. Both countries have long coastlines, a growing aquaculture industry and a strong emphasis on public participation in decision-making. The results indicate that both the Norwegian and Irish public recognise the potential of aquaculture to create opportunities for employment in coastal areas but opinion is much more divided on some of the more controversial impacts of aquaculture on the marine environment. The results also suggest that the Norwegian general public may be better informed on issues related to aquaculture development.

AB  - Old trees are important for biodiversity, and the process of their identification is a critical process in their conservation. However, determining the tree age by core extraction, ring counts, and eventually, cross-dating by means of dendrochronology is labor-intensive and expensive. Here we examine the alternative method of estimating determining tree age by visual characteristics for old Norway spruce and Scots pine trees. We used forest stands previously identified as "Old tree habitats" by visual criteria in Norwegian boreal forests. The efficiency of this method was tested using pairwise comparison of the age of core samples from trees within these sites, and within neighboring sites. Age regression models were constructed from morphological traits and site variables to investigate how accurately old trees can be detected. Cored trees in the Old-tree habitats were on average 41.9 years older than compared to a similar selection of trees from nearby mature forests. Several characteristics such as bark structure, stem taper and visible growth eccentricities can be used to identify old Norway spruce and Scots pine trees. Old trees were often found on less productive sites. Due to the wide range of environments included in the study, we suggest that these findings can be generalized to other parts of the boreal zone.

AB  - Mussel culture in Europe produces about 50% of the annual world-wide harvest of mussels. The main yields of atlantic mussels are from Spain, The Netherlands and Denmark, while the Mediterranean production predominantly comes from Italy. Production in these traditional areas have been stabilised since the 1970s, and the share of Europe in the world production has decreased due to increased production outside Europe. The following factors are important in analysing production status and perspectives. Mussel production is based on an extensive culture and depends entirely on natural resources for food, spat and space. In the main culture areas, production with existing techniques seems to have reached the system's carrying capacity. Spat availability can be an additional limiting factor, particularly in bottom culture. In many traditional mussel culture areas, new functions have developed, such as recreation and nature conservation, and therefore extension of mussel culture is now also space limited. Expansion of mussel culture in Europe takes place in areas like Scottish fjords, Ireland and Greece, and is planned in Norway. Further development of sustainable mussel culture in Europe has different requirements for traditional and for new areas. In new areas the main problems are harmful blooms, local productivity and development of markets. Culture in traditional areas would benefit from optimisation of the system's exploitation capacity, improved spat collection and active participation in coastal zone management. This implies communication with other stakeholders, and exploitation of the mussel stocks within the framework of ecosystem management. Experience with this type of mussel culture is also relevant for development in the new culture areas.

AB  - Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable to understand where climate-smart strategies might be used for best effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America were identified as well-positioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However, the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry, ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address constraints and to leverage local prospects.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

AB  - The world is experiencing an anthropogenic nature crisis, with global warming and catastrophes, for example, wildfires and flooding, causing destruction of living conditions and habitat both for human and nonhuman species. According to WWF's last living planet index, one million species are risking extinction, leading to a need for a criminology that addresses the multifarious reasons for this situation, which to large degree is lacking. In this article, I apply perspectives from Green Criminology, Environmental Restorative Justice and Species Restorative Justice to argue for the necessity of these to address species loss and animal abuse caused by wildlife trade and hunting. The implementation of two prominent nature conservation conventions, CITES and the Bern convention, are central in the discussion, with Norway as the case, through which it is shown that these fail to provide endangered wildlife with protection.

AB  - Seagrasses have declined in many places around the world, and the Swedish Skagerrak coast is no exception. Between the 1980s and 2000, the cover of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) on the Swedish Skagerrak coast decreased about 60%. In the present study, the sites that were investigated in the 1980s and 2000 were revisited (1655 ha) in 2003 and 2004 to investigate long and short term temporal and spatial differences in eelgrass coverage. The distribution of eelgrass was mapped from a small boat using an aquascope and a GPS receiver. No variation in total (about 150 km) or regional (about 20 km) eelgrass cover was found between 2000 and 2004, but there were substantial changes (both losses and gains) in meadow size on a local (less than about 2 km) scale. The results have implications for management of shallow soft bottoms, particularly because it was shown that even though no eelgrass is found in a single survey in a specific area, there could be eelgrass growing there in the following years.

AB  - Globally, efforts are underway to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change impacts at the local level. However, there is a poor understanding of the relationship between city strategies on climate change mitigation and adaptation and the relevant policies at national and European level. This paper describes a comparative study and evaluation of cross-national policy. It reports the findings of studying the climate change strategies or plans from 200 European cities from Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The study highlights the shared responsibility of global, European, national, regional and city policies. An interpretation and illustration of the influences from international and national networks and policy makers in stimulating the development of local strategies and actions is proposed. It was found that there is no archetypical way of planning for climate change, and multiple interests and motivations are inevitable. Our research warrants the need for a multi-scale approach to climate policy in the future, mainly ensuring sufficient capacity and resource to enable local authorities to plan and respond to their specific climate change agenda for maximising the management potentials for translating environmental challenges into opportunities.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in implementing Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) as a tool to mitigate negative effects of the traditional rotation forestry system on biodiversity. However, the effects of CCF on forest growth and yield and on biodiversity is still poorly known. In this qualitative review, we compare biodiversity and longterm yield between the selection system, which is a type of CCF practiced in full-storied forests, and the traditional rotation forestry system. We specifically focus on forests dominated by Picea abies, which is a tree species of high economic relevance. Our literature search resulted in 17 publications on stand growth and yield and 21 publications on biodiversity. A majority of simulation studies found a higher long-term yield in the rotation forestry system, but it is challenging to conclude which system is the most productive. The magnitude of the difference in yield between systems, and how it varies across different environmental conditions, remains to be determined. For biodiversity, comparisons of species assemblage and individual species were only made to certain phases of the rotation cycle (recent clearcuts and middle-aged stands). Nevertheless, two aspects can be highlighted: i) the species assemblage in clearcuts differ substantially from stands managed with the selection system. Some of these effects may however be short lasting as examplified by studies on beetle assamblages showing that middle-aged rotation forestry stands become more similar to stands managed with the selection system, ii) the selection system maintains a similar species assemblage as the uncut control during the first years after cutting. In conclusion, management with the selection system may come with a loss in long-term stand yield, but much of the species assemblage is maintained after logging. We recommend future studies to specifically focus on long-term effects on biodiversity - in particular on species of conservation concern. There is also a need to establish a long-term research infrastructure to further develop the field.

AB  - Based on socio-cultural theories of risk and through individual conversational interviews with socially integrated drug users in Stockholm, Sweden, this article examines the informants' perception of drug-related risk and risk management The analysis further examines these perceptions in relation to core Swedish cultural ideals of conscientiousness. The research shows that the informants have a sophisticated system of controlling their drug use and that this is based on a modified form of core Swedish cultural ideals. The article proposes that this has bearing for prevention policies which often neglect the cultural and social context connected to drug related risks perception and management.

AB  - The harvest of wild foods from forest lands is an important activity to many people. People with diverse backgrounds harvest berries and mushrooms for personal use, for commercial sale, for subsistence and for cultural use. Often these varying goals will overlap. Although some management for these products has occurred, loss of habitat for these foods is becoming a problem. Survey information fi-om the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington and other studies in Michigan, in France and in Finland demonstrate the importance of wild foods to many people. Policies intended to regulate harvest of these products may have unintended consequences if the various uses and users are not recognized.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation and habitat quality on sedentary forest birds in an urban and suburban environment. The study area was situated in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, embracing the city centre, suburbs and parts of the rural surroundings. Breeding forest birds were surveyed in 51 forested sample sites (2-700 ha) and five species of resident birds were selected for further studies: willow tit (Parus montanus), crested tit (P. cristatus) and coal tit (P. ater) representing coniferous forest and marsh tit (P. palustris) and nuthatch (Sitta europaea) representing deciduous forest. A spatial landscape analysis was made using a geographical information system (GIS). In 21 of the smaller sites (2-200 ha), a field study was conducted to examine habitat quality parameters like vegetation age, structure and composition, and human-induced disturbance. The probability of occurrence (breeding) of bird species as functions of landscape and habitat descriptors was tested using logistic regression. All investigated species of the Parus guild showed high probabilities of occurrence only in forest patches larger than 200-400 ha, and was not present in patches smaller than 10-30 ha. This meant that patches of presumably suitable habitat (coniferous vs. moist deciduous forest) were left unoccupied. The amount of standing dead and decaying trees provided additional explanation for the distribution of the willow tit. Large areas of urban open land, industrial land use and large bodies of water had a negative influence on the probability of occurrence of several species, which indicate that they were sensitive to isolation. The probability of occurrence of the marsh tit was also influenced by distance to other sample sites with marsh tits. Unlike the Parus species, the nuthatch was breeding in most of the parks and forest remnants. This species prefers mature deciduous forest, mainly oak, which habitat was common in the urban environment. The nuthatch was only absent in some of the smallest (a few ha) forest fragments, with a mean distance between forest patches in the surroundings of over 100 m. The study showed that large forest areas and a high amount of forest in the landscape are important for the investigated resident birds that are not adapted to the urban environment. Vast areas without tree-cover seemed to be poor habitat and/or restrict dispersal. Strips of high-quality habitats, including standing trees with nest-holes, were not entirely absent in the urban and suburban environment.

AB  - This study investigated the sensitivity of managed boreal forests to climate change, with consequent needs to adapt the management to climate change. Model simulations representing the Finnish territory between 60 and 708 degrees N showed that climate change may substantially change the dynamics of managed boreal forests in northern Europe. This is especially probable at the northern and southern edges of this forest zone. In the north, forest growth may increase, but the special features of northern forests may be diminished. In the south, climate change may create a suboptimal environment for Norway spruce. Dominance of Scots pine may increase on less fertile sites currently occupied by Norway spruce. Birches may compete with Scots pine even in these sites and the dominance of birches may increase. These changes may reduce the total forest growth locally but, over the whole of Finland, total forest growth may increase by 44%, with an increase of 82% in the potential cutting drain. The choice of appropriate species and reduced rotation length may sustain the productivity of forest land under climate change.

AB  - Flood-resilient spatial planning in urban areas involves designing and implementing structural and nonstructural measures. For the latter, urban planners apply a precautionary principle, which is normally not grounded in the actual performance of the urban drainage system (UDS). This approach, however, fails during weather extremes with heavy precipitation. This paper presents a new concept for reducing pluvial flood risks in the urban planning process. The novelty of the developed planning support system named Extreme Weather Layer (EWL) is that it creates dynamic interlinkages between land developments, the performance of UDS, and other factors that contribute to flood risk. The EWL is built on the digital twin of the existing UDS and delivers an easy-to-use concept, where the end user can analyze hydraulic modelling results interlinked with climate scenarios using the GIS platform. This allows planning specialists to consider land use and soil types in the urban environment to simulate the response of the storm water system and the catchments to different rainfall events. This proposed approach was piloted in Haapsalu (Estonia) and Soderhamn (Sweden). The resulting planning support system, which performs as a set of layers within municipalities' GIS, allows decision makers to understand and predict the impact of various spatial planning decisions on the pluvial flood risk.

AB  - The harvest of wild foods fi om forest lands is an important activity to many people. People with diverse backgrounds harvest berries and mushrooms for personal use, for commercial sale, for subsistence and for cultural use. Often these varying goals will overlap. Although some management for these products has occurred, loss of habitat for these foods is becoming a problem. Survey information from the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington and other studies in Michigan, in France and in Finland demonstrate the importance of wild foods to many people. Policies intended to regulate harvest of these products may have unintended consequences if the various uses and users are not recognized.

AB  - We compared the presence of sets of epiphytic macrolichens and resident birds as indicators of old and deciduous trees in each of three forest types in south central Sweden: mixed/deciduous (MIX), old coniferous (OLD) and managed (MAN). Lichen diversity and abundance was greatest in MIX but the mean number of species per stand was highest in OLD. The number of species per stand increased with the proportion of old trees in the stand. The diversity and mean number of resident bird species was highest in MIX while OLD and MAN did not differ. The number of bird species and the proportion of deciduous trees per stand were positively correlated. Thus the conservation of stands of old trees that also contain deciduous (non-commercial) trees will favour both lichens and birds and probably a wide range of other plants and animals. The study shows that the present Swedish use of only the floristic component for assessment of conservation values is not sufficient. Adding area-demanding specialists such as certain resident birds is a step forward towards a reliable indicator system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During 1965-1974 one million dwellings were built in Sweden, most of these financed by state housing loans and available for renting. Although most of these 850,000 apartments are considered decently maintained about 300,000 are considered in need of thorough refurbishment. This is a great opportunity for technological innovations, contributing to energy saving and climate mitigation on a broad scale. However, many of these estates have also been associated with spatial segregation, social exclusion and related challenges. The empirical focus of this article is on an attempt by a municipal housing company to approach the residents of a multi-family housing estate with a redevelopment scheme expressing a will to combine social, ecological and economic qualities under the brand "My Green Neighbourhood". Drawing upon data describing the initial phase and the dialogue activities undertaken during the planning phase, and the residents' reactions the study is conceptually framed by an eclectic approach inspired by the spatial triad of Lefebvre, Relph's notion of place identity, and Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation, including references to some related, recent works. Considering a common picture of municipal, multi-family housing in Sweden as a "success story" the case study is of relevance in the wider context of coping with the challenges of sustainable urban development. It is concluded that projects like this have a potential to decrease energy consumption substantially, as well as contributing to long-term financially sound management by housing companies. However, when it comes to social aspects of sustainability the picture becomes more complicated. First, most sitting tenants would have preferred a change in terms of proper maintenance and modest improvements. Second, most of them will not return to their apartments after rehabilitation, partly due to rising rents. Third, the position of the tenants was not very strong, instead planning rather had a tokenist bias. Fourth, the local government's social mix strategy has to be questioned on theoretical as well as empirical grounds. Despite these and other critical observations, My Green Neighbourhood should not be disregarded as just one more in a never-ending parade of low impact ad hoc projects. Up-scaling the experience of this and similar running projects would represent a substantial contribution to urban sustainable development, at least in terms of energy saving. Finally, to understand the complexities of a redevelopment planning process it is concluded that decisionmakers have to be very observant of the different time perspectives linked to the structural positions and interests of the various stakeholders, for example a building company's desire to make short time profits through major reconstruction, sitting tenants' demand for sustainable maintenance and cautious refurbishment, local politiciang wish to create another social mix in the area, and a public housing company's attempt to reconcile the views of different actors.

AB  - This article employs the notions of citizenship as status, habitus and acts as a framework through which to capture how sovereign power, disciplinary power and biopower intersect in the context of Sweden's current management of migration. Through an analysis of policy and media debates, the article first illustrates how citizenship as status and sovereign power in Sweden have undergone a shift from actively endorsing multilingualism and cultural dialogue to requiring migrants to demonstrate knowledge of a particular language, Swedish, and what is constructed as a singular national culture and its values. The article then homes in on a particular Arabic-language course in civic orientation for newly arrived adult migrants in a large urban area. We illustrate how disciplinary power and biopower work by socializing a group of migrants into a specific habitus of Swedish values and norms. We also unveil the acts of resistance they perform in response.

AB  - Crop production in northern regions is projected to benefit from longer growing seasons brought on by future climate change. However, production also faces multiple challenges due to more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena, and uncertain future prices of agricultural inputs and outputs. Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of climate change on cereals yield change, but integrated assessments that also consider the management and economy of cereal farms have been rare so far. In this study, the effects of climate change-driven crop productivity change on farm level land use dynamics, input use, production management and farm income were considered from the point of view of dynamic decision making of a rational risk averse farmer. We assessed whether a farmer can gain from improved crop yields when using adapted cultivars and managing the farm accordingly. We incorporated crop yield estimates from a process-based large area crop model (MCWLA) run with two climate scenarios into a dynamic economic model of farm management and crop rotation (DEMCROP) to investigate future input use, land use with crop rotation, economic gross margins and greenhouse gas emissions. A time span of 30 years was considered. The model accounts for the yield responses to fertilisation, crop protection, liming of field parcels, and yield losses due to monoculture. The approach resulted in a novel and necessary analysis of farm management, production and income implications of climate change adaptation under different climate and socio-economic scenarios. We analysed the effects of different climate and price scenarios at a typical cereal farm in the North Savo region, which is currently a marginal area for crop production in Finland due to its harsh climate. Crop modelling results suggest a 19-27% increase of spring cereal yields and 11-19% increase of winter wheat yields from the current level until 2042-2070. According to our economic farm level simulations, these yield increases would incentivise farmers towards more intense input use resulting in additional increase of yields by 3-8% at current prices. More land is allocated to barley and wheat, less to set-aside and oat. The economic gross margin would increase significantly from the current low levels. Greenhouse gas emissions from farms were estimated to increase with increasing production, but emissions per quantity produced (measured as feed energy units) would decrease. There is potential for sustainable intensification (SI) of crop production in the region.

AB  - The study draws a synthesis of participation in the regional forest programme process (RFP) in Finland, based on the science of planning theory and on the empirical findings on RFP process. The paper describes five eras of participation; (1) the participatory-turn, when post-Rio programme model was initiated; (2) the creation and (3) establishment of RFP as a policy instrument that applies forest councils as deliberative forum, and Is conducted synchronously with National Programmes. Many scientific studies focused on the RFP process in earlier phases raised scepticism on the capability of the institution to fully serve its purposes. Reconsideration of programme practices started by (4) a search of an "ideal model" for participation procedures, but ended up to the ongoing era that can be labelled either as a (5) participatory downturn or as a strategic-turn, depending on the political position regarding to forest programme, i.e. if the programme is viewed from the implementation or social choice approach. A praxis story of the paper demonstrates sceptical findings on potentials of nonnative planning studies to contribute sustainable changes in participatory forest policy processes. The central role of power is to be more properly understood in the forthcoming studies and institutional developments.

AB  - Studies in landscape and planning history are used here in order to critically examine the debate on urban sprawl and to reveal embedded conflicts within spatial planning aiming to curb sprawl. The paper aims to illustrate this with an examination of one of the earliest attempts to control peri-urban development at a regional level in Sweden. The discourse on sprawl is first introduced and the fruitfulness of landscape studies in capturing inherent and conflicting aims within planning is examined. Subsequent analysis of the seemingly scattered and weak spatial planning of the 1930s and 1940s in Scania, Sweden, reveals an ad hoc regional plan, developed primarily in order to curb scattered development. The importance of the landscape discourse for the development of the plan, as well as the contradictory treatment of urban sprawl (on a local and regional level), is demonstrated. The final part discusses the importance of this historiography for the ability to deal with the current planning situation. The conclusion is that urban sprawl is not necessarily the result of weak or absent planning, but rather of embedded contradictions within planning; therefore stronger planning will never be sufficient as long as the inherent conflicts within the plans (and in the landscape they help create) remain unresolved.

AB  - This article discusses the Finnish forest yoga phenomenon, which incorporates contemporary spiritual discourses on nature, landscape, 'the self' and gender. We scrutinise ethnographic fieldwork materials, autoethnographic writings and other materials related to forest yoga. By using the methods of collaborative ethnography, we assert that forest yoga practices partially question and fragment, and partially reconstruct, previous forest-related discourses, practices and imageries in Finland. This results in new interpretations of forest landscapes, in which the local, global and national scales are intertwined and mediated through the body and the experiences of the yogi in the forest space. In these processes, the forest becomes gendered as a feminine and 'safe' space for the female body, but it is also experienced as a place for negotiating metaphorical and physical 'roots'. Thus, previous national discourses on forests as 'sacred places of Finns' are brought forth, but also reinterpreted in the transnational spiritual frame.

AB  - One of the main aims of Scandinavian rock art research in recent years has been to identify the culture or society responsible for the imagery. This is of mutual importance, as studies of material culture can shed light on the rock art, while the iconography can be used to understand the contemporary material remains. A major challenge however, has been to determine the exact age of the images, as there are no direct dating materials. In order to overcome this challenge archaeological excavations and palynological analyses have been carried out at Vingen in Western Norway, one of Scandinavia's largest rock art areas. The archaeological and palynological data achieved, as well as loss-on-ignition are independent means for the dating of human activity. Since these methods provided similar results, an indirect connection to the rock art production activity may be inferred. Dates from archaeological contexts indicate a peak of activity between 6900 and 6300 cal. BP, with a potential start 7350 cal. BP and a culmination 6100 cal. BR. Palynological data from three different types of basins have documented forest disturbance in the same time period. Local vegetation reconstructions using the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm has proved useful to identify anthropogenic-induced land cover changes in the Mesolithic period and a marked reforestation at the transition to the Neolithic period. The applied methods have helped to considerably improve our understanding of past activity and the environment, and demonstrates the potential of archaeological excavations and palynological studies for dating of rock art.

AB  - The effects of scale, landscape matrix and habitat structure on birds were studied in forest-dominated landscapes in northern Finland. Abundances of birds correlated with different factors at different scales. No edge effect was observed at the large scale matrix level (4 km(2)), even though edge was the most important factor at the small-scale matrix level (4 ha). Matrix components explained up to 47% of the variation in abundances of birds. Fragmentation and amount of edges had a positive relationship with the managed forest species, edge species and habitat generalists. However, virgin forest species and hole-nesters had a negative relationship with edges. Landscape matrix components were more important than habitat components to the managed forest species and the Willow Warbler; whereas habitat components were more important to the migratory species and the Pied Flycatcher. Within a habitat, floristic components were more important than structural components. Habitat generalist species benefited from deciduous forests and virgin forest birds from mixed-tree species composition. Stand age had a positive relationship with species richness, total amount of birds, virgin forest species and hole-nesters. Our results indicate that bird responses to the environment are scale-dependent and individualistic. Bird species composition and abundances are also dependent on factors at larger scales than the individual's immediate habitat.

AB  - Urban soil geochemical mapping was carried out using the same sampling and analytical protocols in two Nordic towns: Hameenlinna in Finland and Karlstad in Sweden. Aqua regia extractable concentrations of 53 elements determined in urban topsoil (0-10 cm) were compared statistically, including cluster and factor analysis, and spatially for selected elements (As, Au, Hg, Ni and Pb). Soil parent material and land use were re-classified before comparison to give a standardised classification for the two towns. Four land use classifications are used: sensitive land, industrial, green areas, and parks. Concentrations of potentially hazardous elements are often elevated in clay and fine-grained human-made soil. Comparison of land-use types revealed that the median concentration of almost all studied elements was highest in industrial areas.

AB  - This article focuses on the roots of the Finnish wolf conflict by using stakeholder evaluations of the wolf as a tool. The recent growth of the wolf population has highlighted stakeholders' contradictory objectives and revealed a conflict between the two main stakeholders, conservationists and hunters, in wolf management. The question of hunting emerges as the core of the conflict. The negative evaluation of the wolf by hunters reflects a competitive situation, which is typical of the historical development of wolf management in Finland. In areas with the most abundant wolf populations, hunters view the wolf most negatively. This study clearly demonstrates that the Finnish wolf conflict is rooted in the values of modern society and carries a long historical, practical and ecological background in which humans and wolves compete over resources, mainly the moose. The conflict between hunters and conservationists in wolf management is connected to the appreciation of moose as game and stems from competition between humans and wolves over their prey and the historical presence or absence of the wolf.

AB  - High anthropogenic pressure on coastal ecosystems, competition for natural resources and climate change are major challenges to the sustainable management of coastal areas. Two cases of resource use conflicts in coastal urban areas in the south and west of Sweden analysed here illustrate these challenges. The social practices of using and integrating knowledge and joint learning in conflict resolution show that dominant actors and their knowledge practices have a strong influence on conflict resolution and its outcomes. Improved conflict resolution requires more efforts to achieve knowledge integration and joint learning of stakeholders in open, dialogue-based strategies in all phases of the resolution process.

AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is a climate change mitigation policy in which rich countries provide payments to developing countries for protecting their forests. In 2009, the countries of Norway and Guyana entered into one of the first bilateral REDD+ programs, with Norway offering to pay US$250 million to Guyana if annual deforestation rates remained below 0.056% from 2010 to 2015. To quantify the impact of this national REDD+ program, we construct a counterfactual times-series trajectory of annual tree cover loss using synthetic matching. This analytical approach allows us to quantify tree cover loss that would have occurred in the absence of the Norway-Guyana REDD+ program. We found that the Norway-Guyana REDD+ program reduced tree cover loss by 35% during the implementation period (2010 to 2015), equivalent to 12.8 million tons of avoided CO2 emissions. Our analysis indicates that national REDD+ payments attenuated the effect of increases in gold prices, an internationally traded commodity that is the primary deforestation driver in Guyana. Overall, we found strong evidence that the program met the additionality criteria of REDD+. However, we found that tree cover loss increased after the payments ended, and therefore, our results suggest that without continued payments, forest protection is not guaranteed. On the issue of leakage, which is complex and difficult to quantify, a multinational REDD+ program for a region could address leakage that results from differences in forest policies between neighboring countries.

AB  - Climate information is an important support for national adaptation plan processes, but there is at the same time a general desire that climate information should be more relevant and appropriate in relation to decision-making contexts. An initial step in such a development towards tailored climate information would be to understand the currently available climate indices, their definitions and contexts. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature on climate indices and factors related to specific climate impacts, and in this way identifies currently available climate indices for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The identified indices are analysed relative to climate change impact categories from the vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans set out by the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, to indicate development potentials and research gaps in climate indices.
   The review identifies 79 definitions of climate indices for forestry and 63 indices for agriculture in Sweden. The reviewed literature has employed or developed climate indices for only 11 of the 25 types of climate impact emphasised as important by the two sectoral authorities. Most of the climate indices identified have been adopted for use in modelling forest growth or crop growth and productivity. The results of the review found indices lacking for a substantial number of impacts that are relevant for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The study shows that scientific literature on climate indices to a very limited degree addresses the specific tailoring of climate indices.
   Potential reasons for the lack of climate indices are discussed, and the study suggests that there is a need to continue climate model development such that the models better represent relevant processes, to advance research on the co-design of indices together with sectoral stakeholders, and to enhance collaboration between adaptation, impact modelling and climatology research. The results of this study may be used in future research to analyse if and how the identified climate indices can be actionable for different stakeholders, and as a foundation to examine the demands and feasibilities of developing new tailored climate indices.

LA  - English
AB  - Density of the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius was examined and reproductive data collected, both in a forest landscape area (128 km2) and in a farmland area (123 km2) with highly fragmented forests (26% forest), in central Sweden during 1985-1990. The composition, age, and the management practices of the forests did not differ in the two areas. We found that the densities (about 0.15 territorial pairs/km2 of forest land) were the same in the forest area and in the farmland area with highly fragmented forests. Furthermore, we found no differences in the reproductive rate, predation rate, body conditions of the young, or the breeding times between the two areas. The frequency distribution based on the duration in years of the territory occupation was also the same in both areas. We conclude that the Black Woodpecker is not excluded from highly fragmented forests.and can successfully breed there, provided that tree composition and food supplies are suitable. However, we do not know what the lower limit of fragmentation is for the species. Further studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation on the Black Woodpecker are needed from northern Fennoscandia, where the density is lower than in southern Sweden.

AB  - United States of America and European countries like Great Britain, Germany, Norway have long traditions in the development of scenic roads, special scenic routes for tourists, National Scenic Byway Programs. They have set criteria for road landscape planning and design, discussed the economic value of scenic roads. Scenic roads are also important for tourism, as well as visual and cultural countryside development in Latvia. Planning regions and regional communities in Latvia have strategic development plans and spatial plans. All of them include high value landscapes and protected, scenic territories. Some scenic roads are defined in these documents, but criteria for scenic road designation are set in every region individually. There are unlisted roads with high aesthetic value which could be protected. Common methods, criteria for the assessment of road landscapes and scenic road designation in Latvia are not developed. The aim of the research was to evaluate and understand the present situation of scenic roads in Latvia. An online questionnaire was carried out in order to find out peoples' opinion about the road landscape quality. Spatial plans of regional communities and planning regions were examined. A field study of two sections of scenic roads was carried out. The research project was carried out from December 2014 to December 2015. Results show that current road landscape has a potential for development, and it needs improvements. The study gives a general insight into the scenic road situation in Latvia and provides basis for further research on scenic road planning and management.

AB  - This paper investigates how a requirement for regional government to coordinate adaptation planning has been interpreted and implemented. Using the theory of boundary organization applied to a multi-level context, and using four counties in Western Norway as a case, the paper develops a framework for assessing how regional level governance actors can support local level implementation of climate change adaptation through boundary work. Even though adaptation is not treated as a salient issue in most of the municipalities studied, regional level coordination efforts are creating a hybrid management space that aids mediation between local knowledge and expert adaptation knowledge. They thus hold the potential for better local level adaptation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is crucial that future generations have the knowledge about nature and the willingness to make right decisions for sustainable development, including the halt of global biodiversity loss. Perception of species and the ability to identify wild species (i.e. animals, plants and fungi) are fundamental for the understanding of biodiversity. Norwegian kindergartens are imposed to give children outdoor experience encouraging environmental awareness and contributing to sustainable development. We therefore interviewed 55 pre-schoolers from eight kindergartens about their ability to recognise a selection of twelve animal species from three different habitats. On average, the children identified four species correctly and they recognised more species from the forest habitat than fresh water and mountain areas. The children were also significantly better at assigning forest animals to the correct habitat compared to other habitats. The findings indicate that pre-schoolers` knowledge about local nature, in which they spend time on a weekly basis, is rather high compared to other types of nature. Despite a large variation in the amount of time adults spent in nature conversing with children about nature, these two variables were not significantly associated with children's species knowledge.

AB  - Urban pluvial flooding in China has become one of the major challenges for sustainable development. This paper analyzes the impact of climate change, urbanization, and integrated disaster drivers on urban pluvial flooding hazards, starting from the disaster-causing mechanisms of urban pluvial flooding in China. This paper then analyzes the main features and progress of urban pluvial flooding governance in China. In particular, this paper describes the progress of sponge cities in China. On the basis of the above contents, this paper describes three manifestations of the fragmentation dilemma at the level of governance, namely, fragmentation in value integration due to conflicting management orders and service values, fragmentation in resource and power allocation due to the lack of vertical top-level design and blurred horizontal departmental management boundaries, and fragmentation in policy formulation and implementation due to outdated urban flood control standards and interdepartmental information compartmentalization. In response to the fragmentation dilemma in urban pluvial flooding management in China, this paper introduces the concept of holistic governance and clarifies the path of urban waterlogging management, i.e., forming a collaborative and diversified governance subjects, deeply optimizing the organizational structure of urban waterlogging management, creating a mature information-based governance platform, and improving the legal and rule of law construction model. This paper is informative for understanding the governance of urban pluvial flooding in China from a government-led management level.

AB  - Forest protection is one of the main measures to prevent loss of biological and landscape diversity. This study aimed to assess to what extent forests are currently protected and how felling restrictions affect the potential annual wood supply within 27 European Union member states, Norway, and Switzerland and to discuss trade-offs between intensified use of forest biomass and forest protection efforts. Protected forests covered 33 million ha (20 % of total forest area) in 2005, of which 16 million ha was protected for biodiversity and the remaining area for landscape diversity. Within the protected areas, on average 48 % of the volume cannot be harvested in forests protected for biodiversity and 40 % in forests protected for landscapes. Consequently, 73 million m(3) (10 % of the annual theoretical potential supply from the total forest area) of wood cannot be felled from the protected forests in Europe. Protected forests do not necessarily affect wood supply given the current demand for wood in Europe. However, if demand for wood from European forests for material and energy use significantly increases, the impact of existing protected forest networks may become significant after all. On the other hand, wood harvesting is allowed to a fair extent in many protected areas. Hence, the question could be raised whether biodiversity and landscape diversity within designated areas are sufficiently protected. Careful planning is required to accommodate both the protection of biological and landscape diversity and demand for wood, while not forgetting all other services that forests provide.

AB  - Transportation biofuel production efficiencies and cruising ranges provided by one hectare of land are studied from a life cycle perspective in the boreal climate zone. Efficient biofuel production is essential in terms of sustainability - especially land use, biodiversity and GHG emissions. Grass methane produced by anaerobic digestion and synthetic natural gas (SNG) produced from willows by gasification provide the longest cruising ranges. However, electricity production by solar panels for electric vehicles is a significantly more efficient option than biofuels. Grass methane, straw ethanol and SNG require less primary energy per produced fuel energy than other options. Increasing biofuel production for passenger cars from cultivated biomass in the boreal climate zone should be very carefully considered because electricity for transportation is significantly more efficient.

AB  - Populations of migratory geese overwintering in Europe have risen rapidly during recent decades, leading to increased pressure on available forage resources and more grazing on agricultural lands. Farmers throughout Europe have complained of yield losses due to goose grazing. In spring, the Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) migrates through specific staging sites in Norway, where the geese graze on dairy grasslands and other types of agricultural lands in the early growing season. Despite this, little is known of the impacts of goose grazing on hay biomass and quality in Norway. An experiment using exclosures to prevent goose grazing, and plots that were open for grazing, was established in Central Norway to test the effects of variable grazing intensity on dairy grassland yields. A single spring-grazing event had severe negative impact at the site with the highest grazing intensity, leading to a 25% reduction in forage yield (milk feed units per hectare) as compared to ungrazed areas. The impacts on the sites with lower grazing intensity were more subtle. The overall reduction (across all sites) of biomass yield was 26%. Forage quality, in terms of milk feed units per kg, was not much affected. Grazing increased the proportion and diversity of weeds, as evidenced by a 49% increase of the Shannon biodiversity index, and there was a 1.3% decrease in the proportion of herbage biomass of sown species. Hence, we have confirmed farmer reports on yield losses, gaining an increased understanding of the overall farmer costs associated with goose grazing in this northern latitude region.

AB  - The settlements along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast from the period 3300-2350 cal. BCE (Middle Neolithic period) represented an epitome of the sub-Neolithic phenomenon, however, recent experience from archaeological, osteological, palynological, and geological studies encourages a rethinking of this cultural complex. Here we reconstruct aspects of Middle Neolithic economies, mobility patterns, and pottery production traditions based on recent field work along the central stretch of the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. We find evidence of mixed economies - collecting, fishing, hunting, farming, husbandry - and local pottery traditions structured by seasonal coastal-inland mobility patterns. We propose a redefinition of this archaeological complex from a 'Neolithic culture', or a sub-Neolithic phenomenon, to an ecohistorical regime. The diversity in mobility and subsistence in this geographical area reflect robust early fisher-farmer societies resilient in the face of environmental variations.

AB  - Transdisciplinary knowledge integration and cross-scale management remain challenges in coastal management after several decades of research and experience with integrated and sustainable coastal management. The aim of this paper is to identify requirements for knowledge integration and development of multi-scale approaches to coastal management through reviewing and re-analysing three Swedish-European research projects: the SUCOZOMA project about sustainable coastal zone management, the FRAP project about conflicts between coastal fishery and species protection, and the SECOA project about solutions to contrasts in coastal metropolitan areas. The strategy of adaptive governance is considered in the light of its ability to assess knowledge requirements for sustainable resource management under conditions of climate change.

AB  - Sweden's wind resources, low population density and availability of balancing sources of energy provide great growth potential for further advancement of the wind sector. The growth and profitability of Swedish wind power drives an increasingly active market, attracting energy producers, developers, utilities and financial stakeholders, which as a result leads to an increase of job opportunities within Sweden and the wider Nordic region. This paper explores the reasons for this surge in potential, looking at electricity prices, turbine prices and the investment market before concluding by taking a look at the job opportunities being created.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic affected travelling in general, and the leisure mobility and the spatial distribution of travellers in particular. In most parts of the world, both domestic and international travel has been replaced by restrictive policies and recommendations on mobility. A modal shift from public transport towards private cars and micro-mobility was also observed. This study seeks to trace the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for leisure mobility. We use a unique Swedish database containing daily mobility patterns of pseudonymised mobile phone users, combined with a survey on vacation transport behaviour. By contrasting mobility patterns for selected holiday days during the unaffected summer of 2019 with corresponding dates in 2020 and 2021, we are able to model and detect the pandemic effects on tourism and recreational mobility. Moreover, by identifying the general mobility patterns, we analyse whether and how the transport mode has changed. Using data on the spatial distribution of recreational amenities, we identify locations that were favoured during the pandemic. In Sweden, even though the pandemic decreased in spread and severity during the summers, most travel restrictions were still enforced, international vacations uncommon, and larger vacation spots, such as amusement parks and cultural institutions, were closed down. Swedish vacation homes in remote or rural areas were quickly booked. This change in recreational behaviour, where less populated areas, open air and nature recreation were favoured over indoor or crowded urban cultural activities, was more substantial in 2021 than in 2020. This result shows how policies can effectively be developed, so that Swedes respond properly to recommendations and adjust their vacation plans.

AB  - The complex interactions between different spatial, temporal, and functional scales in social-ecological systems are recognized as a key challenge in sustainable management of natural resources. We analyze scale mismatches using the example of migratory red deer (Cervus elaphus) management. Hunting practices and organization of hunting are shaped by the social and institutional context rather than the biology and space use of the species. The collaboration among landowners across property boundaries is a potential solution to address scale mismatches but a number of social constraints need to be taken into account. Based on data from a survey of attitudes and perceptions of 509 Norwegian landowners we found a number of social constraints including differing interests and objectives for deer management, land tenure arrangements, weak links between actors at different levels, lower satisfaction with current deer management and cooperation at the higher (municipality) level, information asymmetry, and different perceptions of benefits and costs of cooperation. For example, 73% of respondents were satisfied with current management at the hunting field level (smallest management unit) but only 43% at the municipality level, which represents unit sizes necessary for deer management at the population level. Seventy percent of respondents hunt mainly for enjoyment and meat whereas 30% hunt to reduce crop damage; hence aggregation into larger management units may increase internal conflict among landowners with different objectives. Our results suggest that coordination of management across property boundaries is a more realistic aim than merging of units. Given that income from hunting in Norway is generally low, we anticipate that financial incentives are unlikely to have a large impact on landowners' willingness to cooperate. Instead, we make suggestions for enhancing existing nested governance arrangements and institutional interplay to support scale alignment by means of developing shared management objectives, and creating learning and knowledge sharing opportunities facilitated by an intermediary.

AB  - Climate mitigation is both a pressing and complex task, and one that frequently requires both participation, to involve stakeholders, and capacity building to enable them to change their practices. This paper considers whether the provision of climate advice to affected parties could be an effective policy activity in both respects. The article investigates the feasibility and potential influence of providing climate advice by examining the role that such advice has played in the discursive activities of agriculture extension consultants in Sweden. This case demonstrates that rather than promoting substantial change in practices, the climate issue is used to support conventional efficiency-increasing measures and to change the descriptions of prevailing agricultural activities. We find that the embedding of climate-related discourse within agricultural extension, and the lack of clear climate mitigation goals for the agricultural sector, reduced and adapted the climate issue, accommodating it to the narratives prevailing among farmers, which are well aligned with conventional economic rather than climate policy goals. This lock-in could be addressed by establishing clear and radical reduction targets and through the broader involvement of a wider range of stakeholders.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate long-term effect of different land-use/cover systems on soil erosion processes on the hilly topography of Zemaiciai Upland in Lithuania. The study analyses long-term (18 years) monitoring data from three individual erosion experiments set up on slopes of 7-8 degrees, 7-9 degrees and 9-11 degrees steepness with installed water and outwash collectors. Six land-use systems were investigated: field crop rotation (F), field crop rotation with the black fallow (FF), erosion-resisting grain-grass (GR), erosion-resisting grass-grain (GS), not fertilized and not used grassland (NG) and fertilized and mown grassland (FG). It was found that soil erosion losses and water runoff volume on the slopes of the arable agricultural land generally depended on the erosionpreventative capabilities of different crops, tillage technology and vegetation cover of slope, soil texture and precipitation characteristics. Torrential rainfall in summer and autumn was the cause of most cases of rainwash and soil loss-167.8-229 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), which is described as very strong erosion. Climate warming processes (about 0.7 degrees C over more than 30 years) and a positive air temperature encouraged snow melting and runoff water flow down of the slope surface, even during the cold period.
   Summarized long-term research results suggest that the highest average annual precipitation runoff volume 529 hl ha(-1) yr(-1) and average annual soil loss-11.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) were from bare soil plot in the black fallow land-use system on 9-11 degrees slope with a larger amount of sand particles, compared with the other experimental soil. Erosionresisting grain-grass and grass-grain land-use systems decreased soil loss compared with black fallow system by on average 5 and 15.5 times, respectively. Effectiveness of soil loss reduction of the not fertilized and not used grassland and fertilized and mown grassland land-use/cover systems with a cover formed of permanent multicomponent plant mixture was 99-100%. High erosion resistance of plants by using suitable land-use systems on the hillslopes markedly reduced soil loss (r =-0.99, P < 0.01, n = 18) and runoff volume (r =-0.607, P < 0.01, n = 18). Not fertilized and not used and fertilized and mown grassland systems prevented erosion regardless of the location, steepness of the slope and soil texture and increased the stability against erosion by water on the hilly topography of Lithuania.

AB  - The 1990s witnessed a rapid rise of relational thinking in economic, urban and cultural geography. This trend accentuated the importance of networks and connections, and challenged the conceptualizations of region in which borders are taken for granted. Relational views have become particularly prominent in the context of strategic planning, especially in the European Union. Drawing on an analysis of 18 strategic regional plans prepared by Finnish Regional Councils and interviews of the planners responsible for compiling them, this article scrutinizes and problematizes the commensurability of open and bounded notions of regions both conceptually and in terms of concrete strategic regional planning. We argue that the rise of the relational approach in planning is a fitting example of policy transfer, and the embracing this thinking causes a 'planning paradox': in strategic planning, planners need to think increasingly in terms of open, porous borders despite the fact that in concrete planning activities, politics, and governance the region continues to exist largely in the form of bounded and territorial political units. We then extend the idea of the planning paradox onto the question of borders and argue that borders in planning could be better understood as 'penumbral' borders rather than porous, since they are not solely either 'hard' boundary lines or 'fuzzy borderscapes', but typically manifest themselves only in certain practices. More generally, our observations suggest that the relational character and possible 'boundedness' of regions is inevitably a phenomenon that is multilayered and complex as well as context-and practice-bound.

AB  - Aim To assess the relative importance of climate, biotope and soil variables as well as geographical location for the species richness of plants, butterflies, day-active macromoths and wild bees in boreal agricultural landscapes.
   Location A total of 68 agricultural landscapes located in southern Finland.
   Methods Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the effects of environmental (climate, biotope and soil) and spatial (latitude and longitude) variables on species richness of four taxa in 136 study squares of 0.25 km(2). Using partial regression, the variation in species richness was decomposed into the purely environmental fraction; the spatially structured environmental fraction; and the purely spatial fraction, including variables retained in cubic trend surface regression.
   Results Species richness of all taxa was positively correlated with temperature. Species richness of plants and butterflies was also positively correlated with the heterogeneity of landscape. The extent of low-intensity agricultural land and forest had a positive effect, and the extent of cultivated field a negative effect on the species richness of these taxa. The effect of soil characteristics on the number of observed species was negligible for all taxa. The greatest part of the explained variation for all taxa was accounted for by the pure effect of geographical location. To a somewhat lesser extent, the species richness of plants, butterflies and bees was also related to the effects of spatially structured environmental variables, and the species richness of macromoths to the effects of environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Multi-species richness of boreal agricultural landscapes at the scale of 0.25 km(2) was associated with the heterogeneity of the local landscape. However, large-scale geographical variation in species richness was also observed, which indicates the importance of climate and geographical location for the taxa studied. These results highlight the fact that, even on a landscape scale, geographical factors should be taken into account in biodiversity studies. Heterogeneous agricultural landscapes, including forest and non-crop biotopes, should be preserved or restored to maintain biodiversity.

AB  - Protection of biodiversity under conditions of climate change is likely to place large requirements on existing frameworks for biodiversity protection at both EU and national level. While these systems are not perfectly adapted today, the inclusion of climate change concerns will require revision and addition of new issues, such as species migration corridors and buffers, as well as proactive strategies in areas that may not be protected today. Biodiversity in forest is particularly important as forest range over large areas that include also other land uses; this holds particularly true for the large forested areas in northern Europe. Illustrating complexities regarding biodiversity protection, this study reviews the applicable legal framework related to biodiversity in forests on EU and national level in Sweden, one of the countries with the largest forest areas in the EU. Mainly drawing on a policy and legal study, the paper concludes that adapting the legislative and policy system to a future with large uncertainties in terms of extent of change poses a problem for what are largely reactive systems in particular in terms of legislation.

AB  - While urbanization provides many opportunities to those arriving in thriving urban areas, a greater number of residents necessitates the expansion of housing and infrastructure. This is often achieved through densification, which can lead to increased noise, particularly through increased road traffic. A key challenge of promoting healthy urban planning is to understand potential health effects, especially on the local level. The aim of the present study is, therefore, to estimate and compare the health impacts of road traffic noise exposure for various urban densification scenarios within a neighborhood (Lorensborg) in Malmo center dot, Sweden. The three scenarios include 1) Present-day, representing the study area as it is presently organized; 2) Planned municipal strategy (the city of Malmo center dot's own densification plans) and 3) Health-centred, which involves major structural alterations and reflects an effort prioritize a health-centred approach. Noise was modelled using the Nordic prediction method for road traffic. Health outcomes included noise annoyance, adverse sleep disturbance, ischemic heart disease (IHD) incidence and mortality. Within all scenarios, a large proportion of the study population was exposed above the WHO's health-based guideline value (Lden 53 dB): >80% for Present-day and Planned municipal strategy scenarios, and almost 50% in the Health-centred scenario. Still, densifying Lorensborg (population approximate to 9,600) according to the Health-centred scenario could prevent 549 cases of highly annoyed, 193 cases of adverse sleep disturbance, 4.7 new cases of IHD (8.9% of total cases), and 1.5 deaths due to IHD (17.8% of IHD mortality) annually. The results demonstrated that it is possible to considerably lower the health impact with a more health-centred densification strategy. Important co-benefits for public and environmental health include air pollution reduction and green space creation, although their health effects were not quantified in the present study. Urban planning initiatives must be more ambitious in order to create healthy, sustainable cities.

AB  - Ageing, urbanization, and decreasing dependence of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners on forestry income have challenged the industrial timber supply of several developed countries in Europe and the US. NIPF ownership objectives have gradually also become more diverse in Finland, emphasizing the non-timber amenities of forests. The objective of this paper is to build a more in-depth understanding of NIPF owner objectives, and how information on owner attributes could be used in developing and marketing forestry services. The paper reports results from a survey of NIPF owners conducted in Finland in 2011 (n = 557). According to the results of an exploratory factor analysis a four-dimensional structure of NIPF owner objectives exists, illustrating how a traditional monetary value orientation is only one of the four forest ownership motives. In particular, while aesthetic values and biodiversity conservation are key forest ownership motivations for a segment of NIPF owners, these aspects are not yet fully covered by dominant forestry service organizations. The results therefore offer some understanding why currently available service offerings are failing to meet the objectives of some NIPF owners. From the perspective of developing new business models, recognizing customer pressure towards more diversified service offerings would appear to be essential.

AB  - This study examines how culture is positioned to the strategic goals of one Nordic city. It explores how strategic (cultural) policy measures aim to enable and implement participation and residents' cultural activity, a perspective commonly underlined as a core objective and value in the welfare states' cultural policy. Two suburbs selected provide an urban context to conduct the cultural policy analysis. The findings indicate a possible variation in both the strategic role of culture and the cultural policy pursued in different urban contexts. In suburbs the implementation of cultural policy relies on the civic activities and actors of the third sector. Additionally, the cross-administrative nature of cultural policy related to the different city areas should be acknowledged explicitly in cultural policy and urban planning. To achieve this, more research is needed on the residents' and other actors' role in the urban culture-led strategic development in different areas of cities.

AB  - The REVEALS model was developed to reconstruct quantitatively regional vegetation abundance (in a 10(4)-10(5) km(2) area) from pollen assemblages in large lakes (>= 100-500 ha). This model corrects for biases in pollen percentages caused by inter-taxonomic differences in pollen productivity and dispersal. This paper presents the first case study to validate REVEALS, using empirical data from southern Sweden. Percentage cover of modern regional vegetation in Skane and Smaland, two contrasting vegetation regions, was predicted with REVEALS for 26 key taxa, using pollen assemblages from surface sediments in 10 large lakes, and compared to the actual vegetation within 10(4) km(2) compiled from satellite data, forestry inventories, crop statistics, aerial photographs, and vegetation inventories. REVEALS works well in predicting the percentage cover of large vegetation units such as total trees (wooded land), total herbs (open land), total conifers and total broad-leaved trees, and it provides reasonable estimates for individual taxa, including Pinus, Picea, Betula, Corylus, Alnus, Tilia, Sahx spp., Juniperus, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Cerealia and Secale. The results show great potential for REVEALS applications, including (1) quantitative reconstructions of past regional land cover important for palaeoclimatology and nature conservation, and (2) local-scale reconstruction of vegetation (<1 km(2) up to similar to 5 km(2) area) relevant for palaeoecology and archaeology.

AB  - By 2050, around 70% of people will live in urban areas. According to the 11.2 target of UN SDG "Sustainable cities and communities" to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, the aim of the paper presented was to investigate accessibility and connectivity of urban territories by public transport systems. The main emphasis of the research was directed at transport infrastructure, which can be seen as sustainable, including public transport. The quality of life in a large city is determined by the ability to get from one destination to another quickly and efficiently. To implement this task a methodology has been developed to assess the connectivity and accessibility of urban areas. The method, based on an intermodal transport graph, is presented as an example of assessing accessibility and connectivity in different districts of Saint Petersburg (Russia), Helsinki (Finland), Stockholm (Sweden), and Amsterdam (Netherlands). The results are presented as graphs with clusters of city blocks presented as points. It is indicated that different areas of the city are connected through time values differently. The method can be used to make urban planning decisions about the provision of urban infrastructure, allows for ongoing monitoring of the situation, and filling in the gaps.

AB  - Nonterritorial autonomy (NTA) decouples governance of 'people' and 'place', allowing demographically submerged minorities to protect their cultural - but not territorial - interests. Indigenous peoples are often submerged and culturally vulnerable. At the same time, they are often especially interested in protecting the territories that have long sustained them. So, is NTA well-suited or ill-suited for Indigenous self-governance? To explore this, we study Norwegian Sami self-governance, an oft-cited case of Indigenous NTA. We make several contributions. We enumerate the variety of Sami-specific rights and powers in Norway, categorising them as either territorial or nonterritorial and tracking their evolution over time. By doing this we reveal that Sami self-governance has recently taken a 'territorial turn'. We explore why this has happened, concluding it is due to the insufficiency of NTA. Finally, we discuss likely limits to further Sami territorialisation.

AB  - Sweden has been one of the driving forces in establishing the new post-Kyoto agreement of the European Union (EU), with the goal of achieving a 20% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 over the base year 1990. The Swedish national goal of emission reductions has been set even higher. Global tourism has recently been identified as an economic sector contributing significantly to emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly through transport, but there are as yet few comprehensive studies assessing its role in global warming on a national basis. In the light of this, this paper seeks to provide an estimate of emissions from tourism in Sweden, showing that these account for about 10% of Swedish emissions, and increase rapidly. National emission reduction goals are thus in stark contrast to emission growth in the tourism sector, but this is not addressed in the government's climate strategy. The paper concludes that it may be highly relevant for governments to consider emissions from tourism, and particularly aviation, in climate policy.

AB  - Shellfish carrying capacity is determined by the interaction of a cultured species with its ecosystem, which is strongly influenced by hydrodynamics. Water circulation controls the exchange of matter between farms and the adjacent areas, which in turn establishes the nutrient supply that supports phytoplankton populations. The complexity of water circulation makes necessary the use of hydrodynamic models with detailed spatial resolution in carrying capacity estimations, This detailed spatial resolution also allows for the study of processes that depend on specific spatial arrangements, e.g., the most suitable location to place farms, which is crucial for marine spatial planning, and consequently for decision support systems. In the present study, a fully spatial physical-biogeochemical model has been combined with scenario building and optimization techniques as a proof of concept of the use of ecosystem modeling as an objective tool to inform marine spatial planning. The object of this exercise was to generate objective knowledge based on an ecosystem approach to establish new mussel aquaculture areas in a Norwegian fjord. Scenario building was used to determine the best location of a pump that can be used to bring nutrient-rich deep waters to the euphotic layer, increasing primary production, and consequently, carrying capacity for mussel cultivation. In addition, an optimization tool, parameter estimation (PEST), was applied to the optimal location and mussel standing stock biomass that maximize production, according to a preestablished carrying capacity criterion. Optimization tools allow us to make rational and transparent decisions to solve a well-defined question, decisions that are essential for policy makers. The outcomes of combining ecosystem models with scenario building and optimization facilitate planning based on an ecosystem approach, highlighting the capabilities of ecosystem modeling as a tool for marine spatial planning.

AB  - Shifting land use from agriculture to forestry induces major changes in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, including fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON). This study investigated the long-term effects of afforestation on ecosystem DOC and DON dynamics using a chronosequence approach comprising four arable fields and nine differently aged (10-92 years) Norway spruce stands growing on similar former arable soils in the same area. Along the chronosequence, concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON were determined in bulk precipitation, throughfall, O horizon leachate and mineral soil solution during a 2-3-year period. Soil water fluxes were calculated using a soil hydrological model (SWAP). Results showed that DOC concentrations and fluxes with throughfall were strongly positively correlated with tree height (r(2) = 0.95; P < 0.05 for both conc. and flux) and stand age, while DON showed no such trends, suggesting different origins of DOC and DON in throughfall. The highest concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON occurred in soil leachate from the 0 horizon. Here, DOC flux was 250-310 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and DON flux 8-9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in stands afforested between 65 and 92 years ago. Concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON in the mineral subsoil were consistently low. Flux calculations suggest that there was a net loss of >90% (230-280 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) of DOC leached from the 0 horizon within 0-60 cm of the mineral soil. There was no significant effect of land use or forest age on DOC concentrations in solution from the lower part of the A horizon. The effect of time since afforestation was masked by soil properties that influence DOM retention in the mineral soil. Our data indicate that DOC concentrations in the A horizon of the sites studied were primarily related to the oxalate-extractable Al and Fe amounts in the same horizon. Afforestation of arable land induced a gradual qualitative change in soil organic matter (SOM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), with significantly increasing C:N ratios in soil and soil solution over time. The development of an 0 horizon and the subsequent leaching of DOC and DON to the underlying mineral soil are important drivers of a changing soil C and N turnover following afforestation.

AB  - Determining the mechanisms that generate population structure is essential to the understanding of speciation and the evolution of biodiversity. Here, we investigate a geographical range that transects two habitat gradients, the North Sea to North Atlantic transition, and the temperate to subpolar regions. We studied the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a small odontocete inhabiting both subpolar and temperate waters. To assess differentiation among putative populations, we measured morphological variation at cranial traits (N = 462 individuals) and variation at eight microsatellite loci for 338 of the same individuals from Norwegian, British and Danish waters. Significant morphological differentiation reflected the size of the buccal cavity. Porpoises forage in relatively shallow waters preying mainly on benthic species in British and Danish waters, and on mesopelagic and pelagic fish off the coast of Norway. We suggest that the observed differentiation may be explained by resource specialization and either adaptation or developmental responses to different local habitats.

AB  - In a broad sense, one that includes foresters, nature conservation organizations and the informed public in Sweden, it is common knowledge that the era of clear-cutting in northern Sweden began around 1950. This paper presents results of a study showing that this is a much too simplistic view. The main objective was to analyze how clear-cutting was discussed professionally and implemented in northern Sweden during the late 19th century and early 20th. We also wanted to discuss the development of forest management in this region from a comparative perspective. The study is based on a detailed analysis of extensive historical records from 1882 to 1960 and includes papers and reports from discussions and field excursions. The results of the study show that clear-cutting was widely applied in northern Sweden in the early 1900s as the interest in sustainable forest management and regeneration increased. The foresters wanted to improve the situation in the residual stands that were left after high-grading of Scots pine and, at the same time, the expanding pulp industry improved the market for smaller diameter trees and Norway spruce, making it possible to apply clear-cutting on a larger scale. A rapidly expanding wood market pushed a timber frontier northwards in Sweden and along with this came new knowledge and technology. During the 1930s, the financial crisis led to a temporary decline in clear-cutting in favor of selective cutting, but after that clear-cutting took over more and more. Rather than being a dramatic shift between cutting methods, the transition was a gradual process during which both clear-cutting and selective cutting were seen as rational cutting methods and therefore constantly applied and refined. With time, however, selective cutting was abandoned in favor of clear-cutting. The reason for keeping a persistent myth around the introduction of clear-cutting has its roots in the transformation process but also through the need for a positive historical narrative among foresters in Sweden.

AB  - The Iisalmi Route, a chain of lakes in central-eastern Finland, is more eutrophic than its surroundings. We used multivariate analyses to study the influence of selected environmental factors (water quality, basin characteristics, and subcatchment surficial geology) on the recent diatom assemblages across this steep local nutrient gradient. In addition to the spatial analysis of surface sediment diatom assemblages from 51 sampling sites (48 lakes), temporal changes in the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of one Iisalmi Route lake (Lake Kirmanjarvi) were analyzed using weighted averaging partial least squares regression and 27 fossil diatom samples. Both TP and electrical conductivity (EC) showed statistically significant independent signals in the modern diatom data. The TP gradient was related to till grain size variation suggesting that geological factors affect the spatial TP variation directly or indirectly through differences in land use. Based on the temporal study, the direct effect of geology is most likely behind the steep nutrient gradient in the area because Lake Kirmanjarvi was found to be naturally eutrophic. EC, on the other hand, seems related to anthropogenic disturbance. Our study highlights the importance of taking the local geology into account when assessing past or present water quality or planning for lake management.

AB  - How are Nordic spaces produced and maintained outside the Nordic countries? How do such spaces give shape to cultural heritage, delimit identities and draw boundaries via recognition of difference? Through three Nordic-American case studies we will investigate the theme of Nordic spaces in the context of traditional emigrant culture meeting with present day Norden (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). Our case studies are focused on complex processes in which North American culture and Nordic culture are being fused as well as contrasted. As we aim to demonstrate, Nordic-American ethnicity can, despite its nebulous character, be an important factor for both individuals and collectives. While typically expressed in private and public cultural traditions, it is also a force to be reckoned with in the fields of economics and heritage politics.

AB  - The main problem when adapting forest management to mimic natural processes and structures is the lack of detailed knowledge about historical forest conditions. One way to refine these management goals is by local analysis of change in forest conditions over time. The aim of this investigation was to perform a retrospective regional gap analysis by using historical data. Forest surveys and cadastral maps from the 19th and 20th century were compared with a recent forest survey in a 170 km(2) coniferous forest landscape in the middle boreal zone of Sweden. Changes in species composition, age distribution and landscape pattern were analysed at different spatial scales using a GIS. Spatio-temporal analyses were made to compare representative forest types. During the 20th century, dear-cutting has replaced fire as the most important factor influencing the landscape pattern. The old-growth forest is fragmented and the proportion is much lower than in other boreal forest landscapes, Since the 19th century, the landscape has changed from a matrix of forest older than 100 years to a highly fragmented landscape with only small patches of forest older than 100 years. Multi-aged stands have gradually been converted to even-aged stands. The gap analysis indicates: a large deficit of multi-aged pine forest. Restoring this forest type requires large areas where Scots pine is allowed to naturally regenerate from seed trees on burned sites. Some trees need to grow to natural maturity (i.e. 200+ years) and die naturally. The restoration of deciduous forest should be directed towards mixed stands. Currently used models to describe the natural landscape are inadequate to use as basis for ecological landscape planning. We conclude that retrospective gap analysis can be used to refine goal setting in Swedish FSC-certification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intensive anthropogenic land use such as urbanization alters the hydrological cycle, water chemistry and physical habitat characteristics, thus impairing stream physicochemical and biological quality. Diatoms are widely used to assess stream water quality as they integrate water chemistry temporally and reflect the joint influence of multiple stressors on stream biota. However, knowledge of the major community patterns of diatoms in urban streams remains limited especially in boreal regions. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of water chemistry and catchment characteristics on stream diatom communities, and to test the performance of the Index of Pollution Sensitivity (IPS) as a stream water quality indicator across an urban-to-rural gradient in southern Finland. Diatom community structure and species richness were related to local-scale variables such as water temperature, aluminium concentration, and electrical conductivity, which were in turn influenced by patterns in catchment land use and land cover. Diatoms reflected the intensity of human activities as more intensive land use increased the occurrence of pollution-tolerant species. The change in community structure along the land use intensity gradient was accompanied by a distinct decline in species richness. On the contrary, the IPS index failed to indicate differences in water quality along the urban-to-rural gradient as no consistent differences in the IPS values were found. Our results highlight the joint influence of multifaceted factors that underlie diatom patterns, and show that diatom biodiversity can be used as cost-effective metric indicating urban stream conditions. However, the IPS index turned out to be an unsuitable tool for assessing water quality among these streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, spatial planning is expected to deliver climate adaptation and to manage, merge and balance various societal interests and priorities. To what extent proactive shaping of change is enabled by spatial planning practice is less explored. This paper illustrates how the ideals and ambitions of climate adaptation are manifested in waterfront spatial planning via a case study of Norrkoping, Sweden. Based on interviews with spatial planners and politicians responsible for strategic urban development planning, our study identifies a divergence in ambitions, approaches and positions. In local development plans, the position taken has less to do with climate risk severity than with an area's perceived political and economic attractiveness. When perceived attractiveness is low, precautionary climate adaptation serves as a pretext not to develop, whereas high perceived attractiveness leads to negotiated pragmatism allowing continued waterfront exploitation. We also identify a fragmentation in spatial planning, with weak interplay between municipal comprehensive planning and local development plans, resulting in ad hoc, case-by-case planning. Furthermore, different planning actors are organizationally compartmentalized, creating unfortunate intra-sectoral silos. We conclude that the integrative, proactive and reflexive potentials of spatial planning to deliver climate adaptation have yet to be realized.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve good status of aquatic habitats. Classification of ecological status and identifying the stressors impacting aquatic habitats is essential for achieving this aim. Here, we evaluate different methods and indices for assessing ecological status in a hydropower-regulated river in central Norway using kick-sampling and macroinvertebrate identification through morphology and DNA as well as using environmental DNA. In Norway, the ASPT index (Average Score Per Taxon) is commonly used to evaluate ecological condition in general, although the index only provides evidence for organic pollution. We observed lower than expected diversity in the regulated river, but this was not reflected in the ASPT index, which showed "Good" to "High" status for all samples and methods. An alternative index, the IBIBI (Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index), returned "Bad" to "Moderate" status using the same data. The DNA-based identification methods returned in general higher species richness and somewhat higher index values than morphological species identification did. Our study exemplifies the importance of including relevant biological quality indices in WFD compliant assessments, and we advocate inclusion of a pressure-independent index like IBIBI in Norwegian river management and DNA-based identification methods for future river management in general.

AB  - Ecosystem legacies, reflecting the management history traits, are visible in structural indicators of a forest stand. We assessed patterns of spatial forest structure by using individual tree indices based on the nearest-neighbourhood approach. Five different indices were quantified - species mingling, deadwood mingling, deadwood distribution, diameter differentiation and the uniform angle indices characterising the patterns that show the complexity and diversity of forests: the arrangement of tree dimensions, species and deadwood as well as tree positioning regularities. Managed Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands are remarkably more homogeneous in terms of occurrence and positioning of different tree species and dimensions when compared to unmanaged forests. Managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands rarely show co-occurrence of living and dead trees and demonstrate lower dimensional variability than unmanaged stands. Trees are often quite randomly positioned; slightly regular positionings became evident in managed Norway spruce stands. Structural analysis confirm that large trees are particularly important in maintaining the structural diversity of forests. Forest management needs to integrate maintenance of important structural components and patterns into timber production for biodiversity conservation and sustainable forestry. Natural forests are indispensable source for reference structures in forest ecosystems.

AB  - This article examines the challenges faced by Norway in implementing intergenerational equity in its offshore petroleum licensing regime. Norway has been considered by many to be a leader in the regulation of its offshore petroleum, with an emphasis on state control and encouraging a prudent approach by operators, but also emphasising rational and efficient solutions. Unlike some other countries, it has also enacted legislation to support its convention obligations in relation to matters like pollution and the protection of biodiversity. These obligations are also reflected in its constitution. But climate change and other challenges as it moves exploration into more sensitive northern areas are throwing a spotlight on the conflict between those matters and Norway's vital oil economy.

AB  - Recent research has recognised cycling and walking (active transport) as substantial elements contributing to sustainable mobility and public health challenges. There is less knowledge available on the integrated contributions of local-level governance processes and practical implementation of active transport promotion activities. To illustrate comprehensively the contributions of local-level activities, we defined a framework presenting transformative capacity towards active sustainable transport. The framework presents the essential elements and criteria in assessing the level of contributions towards active and sustainable mobility. Previous literature and a case study in six Finnish municipalities comprising interviews and documentary analysis were our primary research data. The Finnish experience shows that local actors can have different, yet successful, approaches in building transformative capacity towards active and sustainable transport.

AB  - Private nonindustrial forest owners' intention to safeguard biodiversity in their own forest was studied by applying the theory of planned behavior. The data were collected in a nationwide mail survey sent to 3,000 Finnish forest owners (response rate 35%). The impact of attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on the intention to safeguard biodiversity was empirically tested by estimating structural equation models (SEM). The empirical estimations supported the theoretical model. The influence of perceived behavioral control was inhibiting on the intention and slightly stronger than the explanatory power of attitude or the subjective norm. External factors had an impact on the explanatory pattern of the intention. The effect of subjective norm increased and the role of attitude decreased with age. Academic education increased the importance of attitudes and decreased the role of normative pressures. In the development of voluntary measures aimed at safeguarding biodiversity, special attention should be paid to the reduction of the obstacles for the implementation perceived by forest owners. Forest owners often perceive important to retain decision-making power for the next generation. Forest owners should be provided with information about the different measures for safeguarding biodiversity and the contract terms.Study Implications: Forest owners consider active timber production, compensation level, willingness to retain decision-making power for the next generation, and small forest ownership as factors that inhibit their intention to safeguard biodiversity in their own forests. Forest owners' attitude toward safeguarding forest biodiversity and the normative pressures the reference groups create have a slightly smaller effect on intention. It is important to take the views of forest owners into account when developing voluntary measures for safeguarding biodiversity. It is essential to distribute information to forest owners about the available measures, their requirements, and compensation.

AB  - Energy consumption of radio access networks is related to the speed and volume of mobile data traffic. Finland aims to achieve two conflicting targets by 2015, the one of 100 Mbps user data rate provision to nearly all citizens and the other of the reduction of Information and Communications Technology industry carbon footprint. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the energy consumption for several radio access networks deployment scenarios. Mobile operators can advance energy efficiency through (1) energy optimization of individual sites and (2) choice of energy efficient network deployment strategies. Models for the site power consumption, the average site traffic load factor and the average subscription mobile data traffic, are developed. The results show a reduction of energy consumption for mobile network based on LTE radio access technology which operates at 1800 MHz in urban region and 800 MHz in suburban and rural regions. In the dense urban region the LTE base stations are installed on the existing sites and in the less-dense urban region, wide-to-local area offloading is required.

AB  - Philippines sits on a global hotspot where the epicenter of marine biodiversity is found. To maintain ecological integrity of this seascape, community-based marine conservation projects like the Calatagan Mangrove Forest Conservation Park (CMFCP) have been introduced. However, in the years of implementing these projects, studies to determine the importance of gender roles in conservation were very few. This study was conducted to analyze gender role participation of the people who worked in the conservation site. Conducted through field interviews, observations, and focus group discussions, the research adapted the analytical gender and environment framework by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation. In managing CMFCP, gender complementation was observed where tasks perceived as heavy were dominated by men and management of resources were done by women. In addition, there has been an observed increase of women's participation to marine conservation in parallel to high number of women holding executive roles. Of the nineteen tasks identified, eight were participated by women. Productive work of women concentrated on wet season whereas their domestic roles were observed for both seasons. On the other hand, men's productive role was observed for both seasons where their domestic roles were seen only during dry season. Both genders were knowledgeable on the different marine resources present in the area. Women were able to identify more resources than men in terms of class. This may be linked to women's role as tour guides. In this program, the rise of women working in marine conservation was observed.

AB  - Wind power is rapidly growing in the Finnish grid, and Finland's electricity consumption is low in the summer compared to the winter. Hence, there is a need for storage that can absorb a large amount of energy during summer and discharge it during winter. This study examines one such storage technology, geological hydrogen storage, which has the potential to store energy on a GWh scale and also over longer periods of time. Finland's electricity generation system was modelled with and without hydrogen storage using the LEAP-NEMO modeling toolkit. The results showed about 69% decline in carbon dioxide emissions as well as a decline in the fossil fuel-based power accompanied with a higher capability to meet demand with less imports in both scenarios. Finally, a critical analysis of the Finnish electricity mix with and without hydrogen storage is presented.

AB  - Although biodiversity is considered to be one of today's greatest environmental challenges, its definition remains open to interpretation. How biodiversity is understood and managed depends on the environmental discourses within which it is articulated. This paper examines how the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC), one of the largest environmental NGOs in Sweden, describes biodiversity in its 2011 yearbook. The yearbook is aimed at a wide audience and is intended to improve the general public's understanding of biodiversity. Using discourse analysis, this study shows how the SSNC defines biodiversity by re-articulating three environmental discourses and integrating them into a single storyline. The analysis shows how these discourses offer different possibilities for different subject positions to speak about and act in relation to biodiversity. Finally, the study shows how normative implications for action are articulated as consequences of these definitions and who is responsible for performing these actions.

AB  - In this paper we show that the number of grass snake (Narrix natrix L.) specimens deposited in Swedish museum collections has declined in the last eighty years, and that this is correlated with a dramatic national decrease in the number of livestock holdings. These results support the hypothesis that Swedish grass snakes are declining and that this may be linked to a loss of important nesting-environments provided by open manure heaps in small-scale farming. Our study suggests that information obtained from museum databases potentially may be used to explore population trends for snakes and other reptiles.
