AB  - The rapid growth of cities requires effective management of transport demand and restructuring of transport systems to address the needs of growing urban populations in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable way. In recent years, car sharing has emerged as an alternative to owning cars in cities, which has potential to bring environmental gains and address social considerations. There is a sizeable academic inquiry about the social and environmental benefits of car sharing and the barriers to its introduction and provision in different empirical contexts. However, most research on the determinants of its uptake and the ease of provision remains limited to investigating consumer demand and how to realise the benefits of car sharing. Drawing on cases from the UK, Israel, Sweden and Finland, this paper focuses on the institutional and policy settings to understand the systemic barriers for car sharing services in diverse urban contexts to expand knowledge on the challenges to and the challenges that emerge from car sharing schemes.

AB  - We studied the effects of traditional forest management practices (i.e. forest exploitation activities such as burning, cutting and livestock grazing) on carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages in Pyrenean oak forests of NW Spain. A total of 11 370 carabid individuals representing 61 species were collected by pitfall trapping from May to October 2004 in four types of traditionally managed oak ecosystems: "dehesa", "mature open", "mature closed" and "young". These four management types experienced a variety of anthropogenic activities, resulting in differences in the structure and composition of the tree and understorey vegetation layers. We showed that the four management types were quite similar at the carabid assemblage level, mainly supporting open habitat and generalist species. The "dehesa" system was most distinct with a higher species richness (not significantly) and with several unique species, probably travelling from the adjacent grassland. However, many species responded significantly to the type of management, depending on the habitat associations of the species. We also found strong responses of some of the species to one type of management, either positive (exclusively collected from one management type) or negatively (completely absent). Shrub cover and soil organic matter content were the main environmental variables determining the carabid assemblage structure. At the regional scale, the four management types accounted for a high carabid beetle diversity. This diversity appears to be threatened by landscape homogenization, since traditional management practices are disappearing due to recent land-use changes in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The majority of previous cross-country studies of human factors relevant to traffic safety have not operationalized and measured culture. Also studies in this vein have mostly been carried out in Europe and the United States. The aim of the study was to examine country cluster differences, based on the Culture's Consequences framework, in road traffic risk perception, attitudes towards traffic safety and driver behaviour in samples from Norway, Russia, India, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Turkey and Iran. An additional aim was to examine cluster differences in road traffic culture as symbol use and to investigate whether this theoretical cultural framework predicts risk perception, attitudes towards traffic safety and driver behaviour in the country clusters. The sample consisted of a total of 2418 individuals who were obtained by convenience sampling in the different countries. The countries segmented into four Culture's Consequences clusters; Norway, Russia and India, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Near East countries. The findings showed that Norwegians reported overall safer attitudes towards traffic safety and driver behaviour than the remaining country clusters. Individuals in Africa reported the highest risk perception. The countries also differed substantially in road traffic culture as symbol use. Contrary to established cultural theory, prediction models revealed that cultural factors were stronger predictors of driver behaviour than of risk perception. Also, the social cognitive risk constructs (i.e. risk perception and attitudes) solely explained variance in driver behaviour in the Norwegian and Russia/India clusters. Previous empirical efforts, which aimed to demonstrate that culture is important for the risk perception criterion, may have focused on a criterion variable that is not strongly related to driver behaviour. Furthermore, countermeasures aimed to influence social cognition may have stronger applicability in countries with a more individualistic western cultural orientation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape-level alterations such as habitat fragmentation and long distance translocation of genetic material are currently altering the genetic connectivity and structure of forest tree populations globally. As the susceptibility of individual trees to dependent organisms is often genetically determined, it is possible that these genetic changes may extend beyond individuals to affect associated communities. To test this, we examined how variation in crossing distance among the progeny of 18 controlled crosses of Norway spruce (Picea abies) populations occurring across central Sweden affected chemical defense, and subsequently, a small community of galling Adelges aphids infecting planted trees at two common garden trails. Although crossing distance did not influence growth, vitality or reproduction in the studied population, it did influence the expression of one candidate defensive chemical compound, apigenin, which was found in higher concentrations within outcrossed trees. We also show that this variation in apigenin induced by crossing distance correlated with susceptibility to one member of the galling community but not the other. Furthermore, the effect of crossing distance on galling communities and the general susceptibility of Norway spruce to infection also varied with environment. Specifically, in the more benign environment, inbred trees suffered greater gall infection than outcrossed trees, which is contrary to general predictions that the effects of inbreeding should be more pronounced in harsher environments. These findings suggest that the effects of variation in crossing distance in forest trees can extend beyond the individual to influence whole communities.

AB  - Altered forest landscape structure has been suggested as a possible cause for the decline of some specialized forest species in Fennoscandia. Here, we present a time series of boreal landscape changes in 1954-2005 in 16 5x5 km sub-areas in Sweden, based on aerial photo interpretation. We explored how coniferous forest vegetation types, known to be important to some specialized forest species, have been fragmented and also declined in mean patch size and their proportion of the landscape. We divided the studied area into a western (inland) and eastern (coastal) part based on different timing of landscape changes. The mean patch area of forest >50 yrs declined from similar to 90 ha in 1954 to 10 ha in 2005 in the inland and from 30 ha to only similar to 5 ha patches in the coastal area. Common vegetation types, such as mesic and moist forest >50 yrs showed a similar declining trend. In our study area, the long-term decline 1971-2005 of the specialized forest species grey-sided vole (Myodes rufocanus) coincided with the decline of mean focal patch size of forest >50 yrs. The data presented here can be used in further analyses of species-landscape interactions along spatiotemporal gradients.

AB  - With the occurrence of urban densification, understanding the necessity of encouraging and promoting climate- and environment-friendly urban areas has gained ground with urban planners. Ensuring adequate and easily accessible green public spaces is essential for creating healthy environments. In this current study, we look closely at how heritage combined with urban gardening can function as a means to enhance areas that require regeneration. We ask how, in culturally mixed neighbourhoods, urban gardening can link visions of social and physical well-being with urban regeneration. This study is a comparative case study of two regeneration projects: 1) the Darwin Ecosystem Project, which promotes alternative eco-friendly lifestyles and innovative start-ups through the adaptive reuse of former military barracks in Bordeaux, France; and 2) Dr. Dedichen's Greenhouse, situated in a heritage environment of a former psychiatric hospital in the eastern part of Oslo, Norway. Conflicting economic, political and cultural views are likely to affect the heritage discourse in marginalised urban areas. When describing heritage in the two neighbourhoods, we used the 'ruinisation' approach to ensure an inclusive understanding of heritage. We describe how old buildings, fragments of larger structures adjacent to the remains of recent history, can be integrated into urban planning initiatives as part of larger, active place-remaking processes. Residents, artists and various citizen's groups, alongside planning authorities, are cooperating to transform neighbourhoods into healthy, climate- and environment-friendly places to live and work. Therefore, heritage combined with urban agriculture is a means to enhance areas that require regeneration.

AB  - Analysis of food consumption and agricultural production trends in Sweden has focused on domestic food production levels and yields, overlooking human dependence on ecosystem support. We estimate the ecosystem areas appropriated (ArEAs) for agricultural production (crop and animal feed production and grazing in arable land and marine production for fishmeal used in animal feed) to satisfy Swedish food consumption needs from 1962 to 1994. The total agroecosystem areas worldwide supporting Swedish food consumption (that is, domestic production less exports plus imports) have declined by almost one-third since the 1960s as a result of consumption changes and agricultural intensification. By 1994, Swedish consumption of domestic food crops was halved and consumers relied on agricultural areas outside Sweden to satisfy more than a third (35%) of food consumption needs. Surprisingly, 74% of manufactured animal feed ArEAs were from imported inputs. Moreover, marine ArEAs equal to 12% of the total appropriated areas were needed to support fishmeal usage in animal feed. The results show that domestic agricultural areas do not support Swedish food consumption and that the bulk of manufactured feed used in animal products' production in Sweden is supplied by ecosystems of other nations. These are hidden subsidies of nature, not explicit in Swedish national agricultural policy. Sweden must recognize its high level of dependence on the capacity of ecosystems of other nations to supply its food needs. Ignorance of ecosystem support may increase vulnerability.

AB  - Peatland forest management is an important source of human-induced additional nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon loads to surface waters in Finland. Ditch network maintenance (DNM) is typically used to ensure sufficient soil drainage for profitable timber production on peatland sites, but nutrient mobilization, particularly of phosphorus, and suspended sediment loads from ditches can cause harmful ecological effects on the quality of water courses. Various water protection structures have been developed to capture the loads released after treatments and to decrease the management impacts in forestry. Overland flow fields are efficient mechanisms for water purification, but they are rarely used in practice due to difficulties in finding suitable locations. In addition, leaving breaks between cleaned ditch sections is recommended wherever possible, as uncleaned sec-tions decrease flow velocity and enhance sediment deposition from runoff water. To plan the most adequate protection methods in DNM, new GIS-based tools are needed to propose e.g. appropriate locations for water protection structures. We developed a spatial analysis to suggest locations for overland flow fields and uncleaned ditch sections within the catchment of lake Kovesja center dot rvi (Parkano, Western Finland). Airborne lidar data consisting of 5 pulses m(-2) enabled detailed terrain analysis and finding strictly specified terrain properties that satisfied the conditions of the water protection structures. Half of the field-reviewed overland flow fields were evaluated as good suggestions by forest management professionals and researchers. The model for uncleaned ditch sections worked well on the relatively flat study area, as 77% of the field-reviewed suggestions were rated good by expert opinions. Overall, the approach was evaluated to be useful in peatland forest management. Model parameters can be modified for various topographies, but more studies are needed prior to wider use of the model.

AB  - Aim The aim of this work was to estimate on a regional scale the effects of nitrogen (N) deposition and harvest intensity on N-budgets in forest soils as a basis for strategies of emission reduction and sustainable forest management methods.
   Location The calculations were applied to Sweden, a country with a managed forest area of 23 x 10(6) ha.
   Methods Mass balance calculations, including N-deposition, N-fixation, N-loss through harvest, and N-leaching, were performed on a GIS platform using 5 x 5 km grids. Modelled deposition data together with spatial data obtained from the National Forest Inventory served as the basis for the calculations. Four different scenarios were run: a 'base scenario' involving present deposition and conventional forestry (stem harvest only); a 'whole-tree harvesting scenario' with present deposition and the harvesting of stems, branches and needles; a 'decreased deposition scenario'; and a 'whole-tree harvesting and decreased deposition scenario'.
   Results There was a sharp N-accumulation gradient with an increase in accumulation in the direction of the south-western part of Sweden. In the 'base scenario', N-accumulation appeared in the country as a whole, apart from certain small areas in the northern part. Whole-tree harvesting led to net losses in extensive areas located mainly in northern and central Sweden. In most parts of the country, whole-tree harvesting combined with decreased deposition was found to result in net losses.
   Main conclusions The intensity of the forestry has a strong impact on the N-budget. Conventional forestry in combination with the present deposition level results in a high net accumulation of N in the south-western parts of Sweden and accordingly, in a risk of unwanted environmental effects such as increased N-leaching. With whole-tree harvesting, the N-balance is negative in parts of Sweden, mainly in the northern and central parts. N-fertilization may become necessary there if the present level of forest production is to be maintained.

AB  - The increasing demand for sustainable development will have a profound impact on all types of urban infrastructures. However, there is a lack of knowledge of how sustainable development should be attained and how sustainability of various technical systems should be assessed. This paper describes the framework of a systems analysis project dealing with the above issues, which focuses on urban water and wastewater systems. The project is part of large national research program in Sweden entitled "Sustainable Urban Water Management." A set of sustainability criteria-covering health and hygiene, social and cultural aspects, environmental aspects, economy and technical considerations-are defined. To promote the practical use of a set of sustainability criteria it must be concise and related to quantifiable indicators that are easily measured. This paper suggests suitable indicators for the proposed criteria. It also contains a brief analysis of the contribution to various environmental effects and resource utilization of the Swedish urban water system in relation to the impact of Swedish society in total, to allow for a correct prioritization of the criteria.

AB  - National and international strategies and recommendations are intended to increase physical activity in the general population. Active transportation is included in interdisciplinary strategies to meet these recommendations. Cycling seems to be more health enhancing than walking for transportation since cycling seems to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. Furthermore, the health benefits of cycling are proven to outrun the risk of injuries and mortality. Politicians seem to approve costly infrastructure strategies to increase the amount of cycling in the population to improve public health and shift to more sustainable travel habits. A linear relationship between cycle-friendly infrastructure and the amount of commuter cycling has been demonstrated. However, in Norway and on a global level, there is a lack of robust evaluations of actions and sensitive monitoring systems to observe possible change. Therefore, we aimed to develop the Norwegian bike traffic index and describe the national, regional, and local trends in counted cycle trips. We used a transparent methodology so that the index can be used, developed, and adapted in other countries. We included 89 stationary counters from the whole country. Counters monitored cycling from 2018 onward. The index is organized at local, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, the index is adjusted for population density at the counter level and presented as ratio of counted cycle trips, comparing 2018 to subsequent years. The index is presented as a percentage change with 95% confidence intervals. In Norway, counted cycle trips increased by 11% from 2018 (100, 100-100) to 2020 (111.0, 106.2-115.1), with large geographical differences. In Southern Norway, there was a significant increase of 23%, and in Northern Norway, there was a nonsignificant decrease by 8% from 2018 to 2020. The indices may indicate possible related effects of local to national cycling strategies and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Norwegian travel habits in urban areas.

AB  - Apalus bimaculatus (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Meloidae) is a beetle currently managed for conservation in Sweden. The species inhabits at-risk ephemeral and patchily distributed sandy habitats. However, little is known about its ecology and the factors important for its distribution. We censused 158 discrete sand patches within 31 potential sites for A. bimaculatus and examined which environmental variables predicted the probability of finding the beetle. Apalus bimaculatus was found at 17 sites, its presence at sand-patch scale was positively correlated with sand-patch area, sand temperature, and medium-sized sand grains. Although the beetle is assumed to be a parasite on the solitary bee, Colletes cunicularius (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Colletidae), presence of the bee was a very weak predictor for A. bimaculatus, while other sand-living Hymenoptera were a strong predictor. At site-level scale, the beetle was positively correlated with total amount of sandy habitat and presence of sand-living Hymenoptera. Our study suggests that management strategies for this species should not consider sandy habitats equally. Rather, management efforts should focus on maintaining sites with larger total sandy areas, creating larger sand patches with medium-grained sand and a high degree of sun exposure. We also highlight that biotic interactions between the beetle and sand-living Hymenoptera are still poorly understood but potentially important for successful A. bimaculatus management.

AB  - Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usualNorway spruce with average soil water table of -40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at -20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at -10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.

AB  - The paper evaluates the institutional aspects that have supported or impeded the preparation of the substantive national forest programme and its implementation in Finland. Institutions analyzed here are key organisations involved in forest policy, their coalitions and distribution of power between them, and measures that have been provided to implement forest policy. The time span of the study covers the period from the Rio Declaration in 1992 to the present. The Environmental Programme for Forestry accepted in 1994 can be seen as a basic definition of Finnish forest policy towards sustainable forest management and it also paved the way for participation and intersectoral co-ordination. The commitment of the Government and parties in power into the preparation and implementation of the National Forest Programme has given better chance to incorporate expenses, e.g. indirect and direct public subsidies, into the State budget in order to enforce the programme. The close link between the national and regional forest programmes has helped the commitment of provincial actors to the National Forest Programme. However, the long corporatist tradition in forest policy planning, strong-organisations of key stakeholders and an inadequate conflict resolution scheme have hindered consensus, especially, on ecological issues.

AB  - Biodiversity informatics produces global biodiversity knowledge through the collection and analysis of biodiversity data using informatics techniques. To do so, biodiversity informatics relies upon data accrual, standardization, transferability, openness, and "invisible" infrastructure. What biodiversity informatics mean to society, however, cannot be adequately understood without recognizing what organizes biodiversity data. Using insights from science and technology studies, we story the organizing "visions" behind the growth of biodiversity informatics infrastructures in Sweden-an early adopter of digital technologies and significant contributor to global biodiversity data-through interviews, scientific literature, governmental reports and popular publications. This case story discloses the organizational formation of Swedish biodiversity informatics infrastructures from the 1970s to the present day, illustrating how situated perspectives or "visions" shaped the philosophies, directions and infrastructures of its biodiversity informatics communities. Specifically, visions related to scientific progress and species loss, their institutionalization, and the need to negotiate external interests from governmental organizations led to unequal development across multiple infrastructures that contribute differently to biodiversity knowledge. We argue that such difference highlights that the social and organizational hurdles for combining biodiversity data are just as significant as the technological challenges and that the seemingly inconsequential organizational aspects of its infrastructure shape what biodiversity data can be brought together, modelled and visualised.

AB  - The opening of new areas for offshore drilling in the Arctic is highly controversial. As ice cover in the region is melting at an alarming rate, new areas have been opened for petroleum industry in the Norwegian Barents Sea. Our qualitative analysis examines risks related to the petroleum operations in the newly opened areas and provides insight into the complex and socially constructed nature of the risks. With the use of visual influence diagram- based mental modelling approach, we demonstrate the multiple ways in which the risks are understood and defined. We also analyse the type of knowledge that the risk frames are based on. The influence diagrams present the risk frames in a clear, visual, form. The study indicates that the existing governance framework fails to treat the ambiguity around oil spill risks: the current risk assessments and risk management do not reflect on the multiple ways in which the participants in this study 1) frame the problem situation, 2) how they identify different measures to manage risks, and 3) what are considered as key knowledge needs and knowledge producers by the participants. We suggest that social learning and collaborative knowledge production are needed to move towards developing shared understanding of the problem situation. Finally, we suggest that the rigorous examination and the unveiling of ambiguity may help developing deliberative risk governance measures and moving towards sustainability transformations.

AB  - In many sustainable urban innovation projects, the efforts, endurance and enthusiasm of individuals at key positions are considered a crucial factor for success. This article studies the role of individual agency in sociotechnical niches by using Kingdon's agenda-setting model. Although strategic niche management is commonly used to study processes of urban innovation, the process of niche formation and the role of individual agency has been understudied. We will introduce the notion of the 'niche entrepreneur' as an actor who, analogous to Kingdon's policy entrepreneur, connects the elements that are needed to develop a successful niche that allows learning for sustainability transitions. We will study the process of niche formation and the role of individual entrepreneurship therein, and identify the strategies that have been used by individuals to create a successful niche. This will be done for three cases in urban systems integration: the development of Eva Lanxmeer, a residential district in a drinking water retention area in Culemborg, the Netherlands; the transformation of the waste management practices of Lille Metropole Urban Community, France; and the development of the urban district Hammarby Sjostad, Sweden. Our findings show that for the successful formation of niches, it is necessary to create ambitious, but clear goals and matching concrete operational plans; niche entrepreneurs may play the role of project champions that contribute significantly to the operationalization, monitoring and the effectuation of the original goals of the project; the strategies of niche entrepreneurs emphasize the building of coalitions and the securing of space for learning.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is one of the most eutrophied water bodies in northern Europe and more than 50% of its total anthropogenic waterborne phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) loads derive from agricultural sources. Sweden is the second largest contributor of waterborne N and the third largest contributor of waterborne P to the Baltic Sea. Horse farms now occupy almost 10% of Swedish agricultural land, but are not well investigated with regard to their environmental impact. In this study, potential P, N and carbon (C) leaching losses were measured from two representative horse paddock topsoils (0-20 cm; a clay and a loamy sand) following simulated rainfall events in the laboratory. Results showed that the leachate concentrations and net release of P, N and dissolved organic C (DOC) from paddock topsoils were highest in feeding and excretion areas and considerably higher from the loamy sand than the clay paddock topsoil. Leaching losses of dissolved reactive P (DRP) were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with concentrations of water-soluble P and ammonium acetate lactate-extractable P (P-AL) in the soil, while leaching losses of dissolved organic P and total organic N were significantly correlated with DOC concentration in leachate. Leaching loads of P and N from paddock topsoils greatly exceeded average figures for Swedish agricultural topsoils. It was concluded that: i) horse paddocks pose a potential threat to water quality via leaching of excess P and N, ii) feeding and excretion areas are potential hotspots for highly enhanced leaching losses, and iii) paddocks established on sandy soils are particularly susceptible to high N leaching losses.

AB  - Swedish donor support to forestry in Africa has reduced during the last 10-15 years in spite of an over-all increase in Swedish support to the region. Many forestry projects have encountered problems, but this experience has provided knowledge which can be used to improve projects. As a result narrow forestry projects have largely ceased and forestry is now considered part of broader natural resource management programmes.
   Changes in the aid administration such as decentralisation, budget support and harmonization are reducing the possibilities for support to forestry and it is therefore unlikely that Sida will support large bilateral programmes in Africa in the future. Instead most support to forestry will target regional and global programmes managed by international organizations. However, any aid specifically targeted for forestry will require that countries show commitment to sustainable forest management.

AB  - 1. Habitat heterogeneity has important repercussions for species abundance, demography and life-history patterns. While habitat effects have been more thoroughly studied in top-down situations (e.g. in association with predation), their role in bottom-up situations (e.g. in association with food abundance) has been less explored and the underlying mechanism(s) behind the ecological patterns have not commonly been identified.
   2. With material from 1993 to 2003, we test the hypothesis that the reproduction of Finnish northern goshawks Accipiter gentilis (L.) is bottom-up limited by habitat composition, especially in situations where the density of their main prey (grouse) is low. Special emphasis was placed on identifying the mechanism(s) behind potential habitat effects.
   3. While laying date and large-scale variation in the main prey density (but not habitat composition) were related to the number of eggs goshawks laid, small-scale differences in alternative prey density between different territories later influenced how many young were fledged via the mechanism of habitat-dependent partial-brood loss. As a result of this mechanism, a difference in nestling condition also arose between goshawk territories with differing habitat compositions.
   4. As the relative proportions of different landscape elements in a given landscape is a function of large-scale differences in geomorphology and land use, this means that the reproductive performance of goshawks as averaged over larger scales can be understood correctly only in respect to the fact that habitat gradients differ across landscapes.
   5. In addition to being one of the first papers identifying the mechanism of partial brood loss as being primarily responsible for the habitat-specific differences in the production of young, this study further illustrates the need to identify small-scale mechanisms to correctly understand the large-scale patterns of reproductive performance in territorial species. The repercussions of the observed habitat effect for local population development are discussed.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity in semi-natural pastures of Sweden is based mainly on management prescriptions to increase botanical values (i.e., species richness of vascular plants confined to pastures), assuming plants to be good indicators of overall biodiversity We compared species richness and abundance of 29 species of farmland birds breeding in 88 semi-natural pastures of different conservation value as evalutated by a nation-wide inventory of semi-natural pastures in Sweden. We tested whether there was an association Between existing measures of conservation value based mainly on the species richness and rarity of vascular plants, and three species richness subsets of farmland birds. Species richness of all farmland birds decreasing farmland birds, and dry pasture birds were not associated with the botanical conservation value of pastures. Pastures surrounded by open farmland contained significantly more farmland bird species and more decreasing farmland species than pastures located at forest-field edges within the same landscape. In addition, richness of all farmland bird species, decreasing farmland species, and decreasing dry pasture species increased significantly with increasing pasture area and increasing proportion of a short field layer (reflecting grazing intensity). The species richness of decreasing dry-pasture species of birds was also weakly positively correlated with the proportion of the field layer being artificially fertilized. Our results suggest that there are only weak relationships if any between species richness in birds and vascular plants at the local scale (2-15 ha), so using vascular plants as indicators of overall biodiversity may be unreliable. The present management prescription of intensive grazing to increase overall biodiversity is not supported by the literature on invertebrates, birds, and plants. We suggest that future management of semi-natural pastures should be revised to include a relaxed grazing intensity, which may increase heterogeneity of field layer height, allowing larger areas to be grazed with a given stock size, and may increase meat and milk production due to a higher quality of grazing.

AB  - A rapid loss of species and habitats is occurring globally. Amphibians and wetlands are important components of this overall decline. Wetlands in the boreal region are frequently constructed by damming activities of an ecosystem engineer, the beaver (Castor sp.). The authors investigated the anuran fauna in ten such 'beaver ponds', ten 'non-beaver ponds' and eight temporary ponds in Finland. All three anuran species present in the region occupied the beaver ponds, including a species absent (the Moor Frog Rana arvalis NILSSON, 1842) in natural waters (non-beaver ponds and temporary ponds). Moor Frogs obviously benefitted from pond construction and removal of trees by beavers leading to a plenitude of shallow water and a wide belt of emergent vegetation. The results show that beavers offer high-quality habitats for anurans and facilitate the occurrence of Moor Frogs. It is suggested that these ecosystem engineers could be used in ecosystem restoration. The beaver clearly represents a species that promotes amphibian conservation.

AB  - Cultural heritage is today considered to be an asset well-suited to opening up new possibilities in marginal rural areas in need of additional business sectors, of which tourism is one of the most flourishing. This article discusses some of the precautions that have to be taken if a relationship is to develop that is beneficial to all parties involved and in which both heritage management and tourism are going to be winners. Cultural heritage assets are often considered vulnerable resources, but at the same time they stimulate emotions and may represent experiences highly sought after by a particular niche of tourists. From a comparative study of two upper mountain areas in Norway where mountain summer farming still exists, the article discusses the particular type of adaptations found in these regions as part of the heritage tourism debate.

AB  - 1. In a landscape consisting primarily of intensive forestry interspersed with some protected areas, multifunctional forestry with retention trees can play a crucial role in nature conservation. Accurate mapping of retention trees is important for guiding landscape-level conservation and forest management and improving landscape connectivity. Sizeable dead and living retention trees play a particularly important ecological role but even their large-scale inventory is often intensive through field work and/or inaccurate. We aimed to detect and classify retention trees using the novel nationwide Finnish airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (similar to 5 pulses/m(2)) in conjunction with unrectified colour-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery.
   2. Applying photogrammetric principles, we added spectral information from the CIR imagery to the ALS-derived point cloud. For a training dataset of 160 retention trees from 19 stands and a geographically separate validation dataset of 79 trees from eight stands, we segmented trees via individual tree detection (ITD), removed most trees belonging to the regenerating vegetation layer, and classified trees into living conifers, living broadleaves and dead trees by linear discriminant analysis.
   3. The detection rate via ITD differed considerably for dead and living trees, with 41.7% of all dead and 83.8% of all living trees being detected with relatively low commission error rates. Dead trees with smaller diameters and heights were more likely missed, while grouping caused living tree omission. For classification into living conifers, living broadleaves and dead trees, an overall accuracy of 67.3% was achieved in training and 71.2% in validation using only ALS-derived metrics. When adding spectral metrics, the overall accuracies were 79.6% and 61.0% for training and validation respectively.
   4. Our findings imply that wall-to-wall large-scale high density ALS data can be used to detect retention trees rather accurately-even larger dead trees-and that metrics derived solely from ALS data can accurately classify detected retention trees into living conifers, living broadleaves and dead trees. Considering the ecological value of retention trees, our results are promising and indicate ALS data of the studied pulse density are a cost-effective option for large area mapping of retention trees in countries with such data available.

AB  - We studied metal contamination of streams in the forestry dominated and close-on pristine subcatchments in Finland and Russian Karelia. In this area, atmospheric deposition and point loading are insignificant as sources of metals, while geochemical Sources and silvicultural activities are important. Aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. was used as a sentinel organism measuring the metal contamination. Tufts of Fontinalis were collected at 10 Russian and 8 Finnish stream sites for the measurement of whole-plant Al, Fe, Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb and Ni concentrations. The average Al, Fe, Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni concentrations were statistically significantly higher in the Finnish moss samples than in the Russian ones. In particular, concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn in many Finnish streams clearly exceeded natural background concentrations and were comparable to the earlier results from streams affected by metal loading from point and non-point sources. The results suggest that silvicultural practices in combination with specific geochemical features may cause metal contamination of streams in areas considered otherwise unpolluted. We stress the importance of taking precautions against forestry-induced metal contamination.

AB  - In this paper an image of a sustainable transport system for Sweden in 2050 is outlined. The emissions per capita in this image may be generalized to a global population of 9 billions, and still be consistent with a stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration at 450ppm (parts per million). Swedish transport energy use per capita is 4.6MWh in the image, compared to 12.5MWh at present. The aim is, first, to widen the perspective of sustainable transport futures and, second, to provide a basis for present decisions in areas characterized by a high inertia, e.g. regarding infrastructure and the built-up environment. All transport generated by the lifestyles of Swedish residents are included. The reduction of energy use in the image is primarily achieved by an introduction of energy efficient vehicles and a conscious combination of IT-services and urban planning. The latter aims at increasing functional accessibility while reducing commuting. A prioritization of leisure travel to structurally-enforced travel gives the possibility to increase leisure travel per capita by one third. However, this is contingent on a 50% reduction of per capita car travel in cities. Given the set-up target, it may be concluded that the need for new arterial road capacity in cities often is negligible, even with a considerable population increase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Species may benefit from green infrastructure, i.e. the network of natural and anthropogenic habitat remnants in human-dominated landscapes, if it helps isolated populations in remaining habitat patches to be functionally connected. The importance of green infrastructure is therefore increasingly emphasized in conservation policy to counter biodiversity loss. However, there is limited evidence, particularly in plants, that green infrastructure promotes functional connectivity, i.e. supports the colonization of habitat patches across a landscape. We applied landscape genetics to test whether the green infrastructure supports structural and functional connectivity in the grassland perennial Galium verum, in 35 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden. We used multivariate genetic clustering techniques, nestedness analyses and conditional inference trees to examine landscape-scale patterns in genetic diversity and structure of plant populations in the green infrastructure surrounding semi-natural grasslands. Inferred functional connectivity explained genetic variation better than structural connectivity, yielding positive effects on genetic variation. The road verge network, a major structural component of the green infrastructure and its functional connectivity, most effectively explained genetic diversity and composition in G. verum. Galium verum ramets occupying the surrounding landscape proved to be genetic subsets of focal grassland populations, shaping a nested landscape population genetic structure with focal grasslands, particularly ancient ones, harbouring unique genetic diversity. This nested pattern weakened as road network density increased, suggesting road verge networks enable high landscape occupancy by increased habitat availability and facilitates gene flow into the surrounding landscape. Our study proposes that green infrastructure can promote functional connectivity, providing that a plant species can survive outside of core habitat patches. As this often excludes habitat specialist species, conservation practice and policy should primarily focus on ancient, managed semi-natural grasslands. These grasslands both harbour unique genetic diversity and act as primary gene and propagule sources for the surrounding landscape, highlighting their conservation value.

AB  - Seven dynamic aspects of sustainability-resources-were described and monitored thoroughly in a small model conununity-Hagaby-in west Uppsala, Sweden. The residents' use of local and distant physical resources, such as heat, electricity, fuel and clean water or production of solid waste and wastewater in the model project were lower than the Swedish average, while the utilisation of local material resources like soil and ground water was higher. Economic resources like houses, equipment. greenery and technical infrastructure were administered and used to minimise costs for construction, maintenance, rents and fees. Social and organisational resources were outlined and managed to facilitate relations between residents and between local professionals in the area. Other goals in the planning of Hagaby, were to facilitate an efficient local as well as distant mobility (transportation and communication) and to organise space for social contact as well as for privacy for individuals and households. Biological, cultural and aesthetic resources were important indirect factors affecting the inhabitants' feeling of rootedness and their sense of place. All seven resources were managed in its site context to optimise the sustainability of the unique local community.
   The results from Hagaby were also compared with preliminary data from a new research project investigating sustainability conditions in three common Swedish townscape types in four municipalities. Preliminary results showed that sustainability strengths and weaknesses in several cases indeed differ quantitatively and qualitatively between different typical parts of the city. The results support that the dynamic resource model presented in this paper, should be helpful in establishing place and situation adapted sustainability strategies in any type of Swedish local community.

AB  - The design of Jubileumsparken in Gothenburg, Sweden runs on two parallel tracks-a permanent park will be completed and opened in late 2021, and before that a series of temporary parks and installations had been set up during several public workshops since 2014. The gradual evolution of the site allows ecosystems to adapt and invites the public to leave their imprint on the park through not only directly building and planting, but even more importantly, indirectly voicing their interests and desires which impacts the final design of the permanent park. With a focus on the existing fragile ruderal and coastal ecosystems, as well as the socio-cultural heritage of the site, a 1:1 scale landscape laboratory-the Shoreline Park-was built up together with the public. It allowed for testing new materials, work methods, planting and maintenance techniques that would then be used in the permanent Play & Learn Park. The design process also highlights the need for a closer collaboration between landscape architects and maintenance staff to achieve the sustainability goals and the aesthetic value of the park over a longer period, as well as the importance of landscape architects' continuous involvement in park maintenance and the use of digital tools. The project also adopted geotechnic infrastructure to create a gently sloping wetland and proposed a mixed planting plan of indigenous species, natural succession and exotics to address climate change, and to create preconditions for high biodiversity even in the long term. Through such prototyping and testing, the wider public, maintenance staff, and experts got engaged in this project, which initiated a dialogue about the persistence in landscape between urban ecosystems, wildscapes, and aesthetics.

AB  - In this paper, the environmental impact of logging residue recovery (LRR) and nutrient compensation (NC) in Sweden is analysed and evaluated economically. Logging residue recovery and recirculation of wood ash can generate local environmental benefits, such as reduced soil acidification and, primarily in southern Sweden, also improved nitrogen balance and reduced nutrient leaching from forest land. Recovery of residues leads to a slight increase in net emissions of carbon dioxide, compared with on site decomposition, but this increase is small compared with the net emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel cycles. The impact of toxic compounds is estimated to be insignificant, as is that on biodiversity, when current guidelines for forestry management methods are followed. The total cost, including direct costs and environmental costs/benefits, of LRR and NC is estimated to be about 1.1, 3.3 and 4.6 US$/GJ in southern, central and northern Sweden, respectively. For comparison, the current direct cost of LRR, excluding NC, is, on average, about 4.0 US$/GJ in Sweden. Almost one-third of the Swedish forest fuel potential is estimated to be located in the south, but this potential varies from about 50 to over 100 PJ per year depending on the assumptions made. Thus, when local environmental benefits are also considered, the overall economic benefit derived from the utilisation of forest fuels could increase significantly in southern Sweden, where large quantities of logging residues are available.

AB  - This paper in a uniform manner examines temporal trends in phosphorus (P) concentrations and losses from small and well-monitored agricultural catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Thirty-four catchments (range 0.1-33 km(2)) in Norway (8), Denmark (5), Sweden (8), Finland (4), Estonia (3), Latvia (3) and Lithuania (3) were selected for the study. The time series ranged from 10 (2002-2011) to 21 years (1989-2009). The monthly P concentration and loss time series were tested for significant monotone trends (p < 0.05; two-sided test) using the partial Mann-Kendall test with stream discharge as an explanatory variable. The results show a large variation in concentrations and losses of total phosphorus (TP) among the 34 studied catchments, where the long-term mean annual losses varied from 0.09 to 7.5 kg TP ha(-1). In addition, a large interannual variability in losses within catchments was found with up to a factor of 23 between years within the same catchment. Six catchments showed downward temporal trends in the TP loss time series. One upward trend in TP losses was detected in a catchment in south-west Sweden. Eight downward trends were detected in the TP concentration time series. Overall, our results show (1) a huge variability in mean P losses and concentrations among catchments, (2) a huge temporal variability in losses within catchments and (3) few detectable changes in P losses and concentrations over the study period. The results showcase the need for implementation of mitigation strategies towards reduced P losses from agricultural landscapes in the Nordic/Baltic Sea region in order to improve P water quality and ecology in surface waters.

AB  - This study presents a practical harvest scheduling approach for multiple ownership planning. The approach has both spatial and non-spatial goals, namely, a spatial landscape-level goal to cluster ecologically valuable resources is considered simultaneously with timber production goals. Harvest scheduling is based on the location of the stand, on one hand, and on an economic variable depicting the cutting maturity of the stand, on the other hand. Proximity to valuable resources decreases the likelihood that the stand is cut. Therefore, harvests tend to be located outside potential resource clusters with small and isolated economically mature stands being cut first. In the application of the approach the landscape-level spatial objective was to cluster old forest stands (agegreater than or equal to80) and simultaneously maintain a predefined cutting volume. A stand's economic cutting maturity was measured with value increment percentage. In the top-down application of the approach the timber harvest target was specified only for the whole planning area. In the bottom-up application it was specified separately for individual holdings, aiming at promoting the acceptability of the plan. The presented approach was clearly able to cluster old forest patches. In the case study area, the mean size of old forest patches increased from 3.4 to 5.7 ha in 30 years in the top-down plan, and to 4.6 ha in the bottom-up plan. An application of the current planning practice (referred to as the reference plan) decreased the mean patch size to 2.9 ha. The presented approach is easy to apply in forest planning practice.

AB  - Any-aged forest management (AAF) is a means to reduce clear-felling without compromising profitability or timber production. The concept of AAF is to choose between clear-felling or thinning one harvest at a time based on what is better at that time in terms of the management objectives for the forest. No permanent choice is made between rotation forest management (RFM) and continuous cover forestry (CCF). Optimized AAF is never less profitable than RFM or CCF because all cutting types of both RMF and CCF are also allowed in AAF. This study developed a new set of guidelines for managing boreal forest stands under AAF when the forest landowner maximizes economic profitability. The first part of the guidelines indicates whether the stand should be cut or left to grow. This advice is based on stand basal area, mean tree diameter, minimum allowable post-thinning basal area, site productivity, and discount rate. If the optimal decision is harvesting, the second instruction determines whether the harvest should be clear-felling or thinning. In the case of thinning, the remaining two steps determine the optimal harvest rate in different diameter classes. The guidelines were developed using two different modeling approaches, regression analysis, and optimization, and applied to two Finnish forest holdings, one representing the southern boreal zone and the other the northern parts of the boreal zone. The results show that AAF improves profitability compared to current Finnish management instructions for RFM. The use of clear-felling also decreased the lower the minimum acceptable post-thinning basal area of the stand.

AB  - During March-August 1990, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania proclaimed independence from the Soviet Union. After independence, agriculture in the Baltic states changed from a state controlled economy with huge collective farms to a market economy with privately owned family farms. Due to the financial situation, the use of mineral fertilizers dropped to the 1950s level. During 1994, the yields of forage grass and fodder grain were only 40% and 50%, respectively, of Swedish yields. Due to the loss of export possibilities, the total production of meat, milk and eggs in the Baltic states declined by 40-50% between 1989 and 1994. The aim of this study is to demonstrate changes in nitrogen and phosphorus flows within agriculture in the Baltic states after independence and to make comparisons with the situation in Swedish agriculture during the same period of time. A special study was made of whether the changed nutrient flows have caused changes in nutrient runoff from the Baltic states to the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Introduction
   The future protection of marine biodiversity through good conservation planning requires both the identification of key habitats with unique ecological characteristics and detailed knowledge of their human utilization through fisheries. Demersal fisheries are important disturbers of benthic habitats. They often have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, pressurizing particular habitats with high abundances of target species. For the North Sea, we quantified the commonness/rarity of habitats in relation to the environmental determinants of so-called fishing hotspots, to support better-informed conservation planning of benthic habitats in this intensively used continental shelf.
   Methods
   We first distinguished 9 main seascapes in the study area based on seabed morphology. Secondly, we determined average fishing intensity and fishing hotspots using VMS-data for the three dominant Dutch fisheries from 2008 to 2015: beam-trawlers targeting sole Solea solea (Beam-Sole), beam-trawlers targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa (Beam-Plaice), and otter-trawlers targeting Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus and demersal fish (Otter-Mix). Within the seascapes subjected to >80% of the fishing activity, nineteen environmental factors (summarized by PCA) were used to ecologically characterize fishing hotspot locations using MaxEnt response modelling.
   Results
   We found that all three fisheries target highly specific, uncommon habitats. Beam-Sole fishers targeted warmer, shallow, dynamic, nearshore habitats, and within these specifically the depressions between sand ridges. Beam-Plaice fishers mainly targeted the exposed, non-muddy flanks of the Dogger Bank and similar large-scale elevations (50-75 km) where especially the ridges of smaller sand banks are used. Otter-Mix fisheries concentrated in areas with low bed shear stress, located in muddy, relatively deeper areas.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development continues to influence urban planning, and one of the strategies planners use to generate sustainable urban growth is the densification of urban districts. Because densification projects often take place in historic environments, however, this model might represent a challenge to the preservation of cultural heritage. With its emphasis on economic, social and environmental concerns, the popular tripartite sustainability model has achieved hegemony. This paper provides a discussion on what may be considered a fourth pillar of sustainability: cultural sustainability. By incorporating concepts from cultural economics, we will draw attention to how cultural heritage represents cultural value and can be considered alongside other sustainability concerns. The cultural value represented by heritage will be illustrated by referencing three ongoing Norwegian urban densification projects. The discussion leads to the conclusion that it is preferable in urban planning strategies to operate with a clear cultural component. This conclusion calls for adding a distinguishable fourth cultural pillar in the sustainability model.

AB  - In this paper we analyse past sociotechnical transitions, and based on that we discuss the prospects for the central state in promoting radical transitions towards improved sustainability today. The case studies include the sociotechnical systems in Sweden providing for: (a) urban housing; (b) passenger cars as a favoured mode of transport; and (c) piped water/wastewater, all fundamentally transformed over the first seven decades of the twentieth century and especially in the 1940s up until the 1960s. The core lesson from the case studies is that the central state, by taking an active role and by coordinating the roles of different stakeholders, values and knowledge as well as different policy areas and instruments, can accomplish a coherent and effective management of such transition processes. Also in contemporary network governance settings the central state is well suited to accomplish such an active and coordinative role based on its legitimate power to design and implement different public policy instruments.

AB  - The population sizes and the breeding success of Finnish tetraonids have been decreasing for decades. In this study, the presence of a grouse hen with a brood in a landscape was used to indicate habitat-related breeding success. We combined the locations of 938 black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), 388 capercaillie (T. urogallus), and 917 hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) broods after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data by employing Geographic Information System and grouse data derived from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1997-2004. Two large study areas with different landscape structures, northern forest-mire area and southern cultivated area, were selected for the investigation. The presence of grouse broods was positively related to the amount of old coniferous mixed forest. Grouse broods may prefer this forest habitat because of a rich understorey cover and a rich bilberry field layer offering a diversity of insects as food. Broods had a strong positive response to the amount of forest habitat. The effect of forest fragmentation on the broods' distribution did not increase even with decreasing forest habitat. We suggest that there are several ecological causes for the observed spatial correlations. Predation on nests and broods by generalist predators is presumably high in human-modified open and semi-open landscapes. Against our expectations, the effect of landscape composition on grouse broods was more marked in the northern than in the southern study area, most likely because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. This finding supports the alternative prey hypothesis. Further, large drained and reforested peatland mire areas had a negative impact on grouse broods in the north. In the drainage areas, decreased availability of vegetation cover and insect food, increased predation risk, and drowning of chicks in ditches may increase brood mortality.

Explorative in its nature, the paper uses in depth interviews with practitioners in eastern Sweden, several of whom are engaged in work to keep practices of the past alive, to discuss how the concept of revitalization can bear on sustainability. Traditional practices are revived as an alternative to industrialized agriculture, and as having a bearing on resilient cultivation systems as well as social relations. They are seen as means of increasing food security and reversing the negative biodiversity development caused by increased monoculture. We understand tradition as a process of negotiation and adaptation to the present, where revivals to some extent necessarily change the traditions that they attempt to revive. Tradition is thus a dynamic concept, always made in the present, never fixed but constantly evolving. In the challenges created by climate change and environmental degradation, it is increasingly voiced that true sustainability requires a transformation of the cultural system. In many cases, people are turning to tradition for sustainable alternatives to industrialized ways of life and to protect a diversity threatened by a dominant and unsustainable lifestyle.

AB  - Deadwood-associated species are increasingly targeted in forest biodiversity conservation. In order to improve structural biodiversity indicators and sustainable management guidelines, we need to elucidate ecological and anthropogenic drivers of saproxylic diversity. Herein we aim to disentangle the effects of local habitat attributes which presumably drive saproxylic beetle communities in temperate lowland deciduous forests. We collected data on saproxylic beetles in 104 oak and 49 beech stands in seven French lowland forests and used deadwood, microhabitat and stand features (large trees, openness) as predictor variables to describe local forest conditions. Deadwood diversity and stand openness were consistent key habitat features for species richness and composition in deciduous forests. Large downed deadwood volume was a significant predictor of beetle species richness in oak forests only. In addition, the density of cavity- and fungus-bearing trees had weak but significant effects. We recommend that forest managers favor the local diversification of deadwood types, especially the number of combinations of deadwood positions and tree species, the retention of large downed deadwood and microhabitat-bearing trees in order to maximize the saproxylic beetle diversity at the stand scale in deciduous forests. To improve our understanding of deadwood-biodiversity relationships, further research should be based on targeted surveys on species-microhabitat relationships and should investigate the role of landscape-scale deadwood resources and of historical gaps in continuity of key features availability at the local scale.

AB  - Housing architecture can be regarded as both a product of culture and a medium that can influence change in a society. The relationship between identity and identification can be a source of conflict between architects, planners, and designers and those who must live with the designs. The Skolt Sami have traditionally lived in the borderland area between Finland, Russia, and Norway. Some Skolt villages were remote from the interests of authorities until the early 20th century. They had retained their seminomadic way of life in which they changed dwelling places according to the yearly cycle. In this article, I focus on how Finnish housing ideology finally influenced Skolts' life and culture in Suenjel Village (after resettling, called Sevettijarvi).

AB  - Climate change will pose increasing challenges to forest managers working to achieve sustainable forest management in the boreal forest. To date, discussions around when, where and how to consider adaptation in forest management plans for the boreal forest have been limited. As a starting point, specific objectives for climate change adaptation need to be articulated, which we consider to be synonymous with the criteria for conservation and sustainable management of boreal forests as defined by the Montreal Process. Secondly, because forest management plans are hierarchal - there are higher level strategic plans and lower level operational plans - it is important to distinguish at which planning level adaptation options are most appropriately considered. The purpose of this paper is to put forward a range of alternative adaptation options that forest managers working in the boreal zone could consider during the development of strategic and operational forest management plans in order to achieve sustainability as defined by the Montreal Process.

AB  - Eutrophication in lakes, estuaries and rivers occur due to over-enrichment with nutrients. Amongst the various nutrients Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P) are the elements which are considered as the major pollutants. The present study looks into the problem of managing nutrient losses both from point sources and diffuse sources. The study was carried out in the River RonneAyen catchment in South of Sweden where N and P have been assessed by creation of a pollution inventory based on GIS technology. The nutrient loads from different land use types were estimated using export coefficients and evaluated using monitoring data. A comparative analysis is done on the measured and estimated N and P leaching from diffused sources and point sources. Protective zones were suggested to decrease the P export from agricultural land, and the distribution of construction cost was analyzed among administrative regions according to the proportion of catchments, cultivated land, nutrient leaching, protective zone and length of river section within each municipality. The estimated error of the nutrient amount from landuse using GIS is 9.75% and 12.71% for N and P, respectively. The diffused sources contribute 91.53% and 94.74% of the total N and total P respectively, so the creation of a protective zone could be an effective way to decrease the nutrient export. The study demonstrates the power of GIS as a tool to analyze problems related to environmental monitoring and planning at administrative level, which could help in decision making and support for better management of the water resources.

AB  - Environmental learning in architecture and planning has shifted dramatically within a few years, from being an individual choice to becoming a collective responsibility and inherent part of professional ethics. Researchers, policy makers and practitioners face the challenge of improving the built environment's resilience to climate change and resource scarcity. This chapter argues for a more pro-active contribution from academic institutions, based on collaborative experiential learning, and three crucial elements including laboratory settings for facilitating creative exploration; intensive interaction between students and teachers; critical reflection of own and other's work. Knowledge brokerage activities based on these principles can trigger better, faster and more widespread environmental learning and knowledge transfer, leading to a more resilient built environment.
   Using the Broset development in Trondheim, Norway as a case, this article investigates the different roles academic institutions can play in sustainable urban planning, from consulting to facilitating collective learning among actors engaged with these challenges. The Broset project consists of two parallel activities: firstly, an urban planning project led by the municipality, and secondly, an interdisciplinary research project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, funded by the Norwegian Research Council in cooperation with the Norwegian State Housing Bank and Trondheim Energy.

AB  - Integrative strategic management for urban regeneration involves reconciling conflicting demands and translating abstract concepts into concrete actions. This article examines how public-sector strategists address these dilemmas by developing a dynamic perspective that helps in understanding how they 'strategize'. This perspective was applied to two urban regeneration projects in Gothenburg (Sweden) and Antwerp (Belgium). Our findings illustrate how actors strategize at different locations and times, putting middle-management strategists, in particular, on the horns of a dilemma. Acting quickly through establishing experimentation spaces could result in innovative outcomes, but politicians and local residents may feel bypassed; however, waiting until strategic visions are translated into detailed actions may eventually result in no action at all. This article helps us understand the disconnect between planning, implementation and performance in strategic management. Points for practitioners Public-sector strategists have to overcome conflicting demands in urban regeneration projects and translate ambitious visions into actions. As strategists' actions can drift from the original goals, they have to regularly reflect on the contribution of actions to the vision. Middle managers, in particular, have to be careful: their leeway can lead to innovative actions but can also clash with initial goals. Finally, living labs - used to implement the strategy at a small scale - should not become detached from the broader urban regeneration project.

AB  - Here we analyze the cost, primary energy and CO2 implications of supplying district heat, considering different supply and return temperatures, to a new residential area in Vaxjo, Sweden. We explore four land exploitation alternatives consisting different types of buildings with various heated floor areas as well as occupancy densities and two levels of building energy efficiency, based on the Swedish building code and passive house criteria. The analysis shows that energy performance of the buildings and land exploitation alternatives strongly influence the annual heat demand and its profile, which steers the design of the local heat distribution network. Additionally, supply and return temperatures of district heat somewhat influence the design of the network. The distribution heat losses could be reduced by 25% and 50% if district heating systems of 65/30 degrees C and 50/20 degrees C, respectively, are used instead of a conventional 80/40 degrees C system. However, for the same land exploitation alternative, the local distribution heat losses are about the same whether or not the buildings are designed to meet the Swedish building code or passive house criteria, since the same pipe distance is required and the variation of pipe diameters is small. A 50/20 degrees C system increases electricity use to boost hot water temperature to avoid the risk of legionella bacteria, and this influences quantity of district heat supply, primary energy use and costs. Therefore, a 65/30 degrees C system appears to be more primary energy and cost efficient than a 50/20 degrees C system. Increased insulation of district heating network reduces heat losses but this is not cost effective due to increased investment cost. The results are similar whether or not the analysis is based on current energy supply or future renewable based energy supply. This study increases understanding of strategies for planning and designing new urban residential areas and their energy supply systems to reduce primary energy use as well as monetary costs, and to minimize the climate impacts of the built environment.

AB  - The bioeconomy has an increasing role to play in climate change mitigation and the sustainable development of national economies. In Finland, a forested country, over 50% of the current bioeconomy relies on the sustainable management and utilization of forest resources. Wind storms are a major risk that forests are exposed to and high-spatial-resolution analysis of the most vulnerable locations can produce risk assessment of forest management planning. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of the wind multiplier approach for down-scaling of maximum wind speed, using 20m spatial resolution CORINE land-use dataset and high-resolution digital elevation data. A coarse spatial resolution estimate of the 10-year return level of maximum wind speed was obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalyzed data. Using a geospatial re-mapping technique the data were downscaled to 26 meteorological station locations to represent very diverse environments. Applying a comparison, we find that the downscaled 10-year return levels represent 66% of the observed variation among the stations examined. In addition, the spatial variation in wind-multiplier-downscaled 10-year return level wind was compared with the WAsP model-simulated wind. The heterogeneous test area was situated in northern Finland, and it was found that the major features of the spatial variation were similar, but in some locations, there were relatively large differences. The results indicate that the wind multiplier method offers a pragmatic and computationally feasible tool for identifying at a high spatial resolution those locations with the highest forest wind damage risks. It can also be used to provide the necessary wind climate information for wind damage risk model calculations, thus making it possible to estimate the probability of predicted threshold wind speeds for wind damage and consequently the probability (and amount) of wind damage for certain forest stand configurations.

AB  - Postage stamp imagery reveals how humans see other animals in their society; how this relationship changes over time; and in particular political, economic, and cultural contexts; and what the stamp-issuing state wishes to communicate to its citizens. A qualitative mixed-methods exploration of this overlooked, easily accessible visual data identifies trends and representative examples of human-animal relations in Finnish society during the countryes independence (1917-2016). The empirical discussion strengthens method(olog)ical discussion on visual culture and data in animal studies. The examination shows the value of systematic longitudinal data, the inclusion of both consumer and producer perspectives in the analysis, and engagement with scholarly debates outside animal studies.

AB  - Sulfate (SO42-) affects the cycling of ecologically important substances, such as carbon, nutrients and metals, but the contribution of anthropogenic activities in sulfate load entering aquatic systems is poorly known. We calculate specific sulfate loads for land cover types, atmospheric deposition and point sources, and then estimate the source-specific flux of sulfate to Finnish surface waters. The largest sulfate flux, entering mostly the Baltic Sea, originates from agricultural fields on acid sulfate soil (24% of total flux). Forests on mineral soil, which cover 67% of the country's surface area, form the second largest source (21%). Additionally, agricultural fields on non-acid soil cause noticeable sulfate flux (16%). Pulp and paper mills were the key point sources (20%) for sulfate. We find that anthropogenic activities contribute to elevated sulfate levels in waters potentially affecting the cycling of nutrients, metals and formation of greenhouse gases in naturally sulfate-poor freshwaters. Based on these findings, sulfate should be systematically included in monitoring and pollution control measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The positive effects of reduced fishing pressure in marine protected areas (MPAs) are now well documented globally. Yet, evidence of MPA benefits from long-term replicated before-after control-impact (BACI) studies and their usefulness in protecting target species are still rare, especially in northern temperate areas. Scientific rigor in the monitoring of MPAs is considered important for obtaining trust and compliance and can increase interest and enthusiasm for the benefits of marine conservation. Off the coast of southern Norway, a MPA implementation process started up in 2002. Based on comprehensive consultations with local fishers and managers, four experimental lobster reserves were appointed in 2004. Two years later (2006), the reserves came into effect as the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries implemented regulations as a by-law of the Saltwater Fisheries Act that effectively banned all fixed gear. Long-term monitoring of the MPAs and adjacent control areas has enabled a rigorous scientific evaluation of the effects of these MPAs on lobster populations, including effects on density, growth, demography, behavior, and phenotypic diversity. As protection effects started to manifest, the lobster reserves attracted high public attention and were soon considered a credible supplement to traditional fisheries management. In the period from 2002 to 2021, more than 50 lobster reserves have been implemented in Norway. Here, we review the experiences since the lobster reserves were designated, implemented, and embraced by local communities in Norway, and over two decades have become an important tool for fishery management. Thoughts on the future of MPAs along the coast of Norway are discussed.

AB  - In this article, I examine cultural production as an avenue for mapping African diasporic identities and racialised experiences in Finland. Hip hop culture has long acted as a lingua franca for the African diaspora and has been central in the development of collective identities among second-generation European youth of colour. Prior to the 2010s, the landscape of Finnish hip hop was largely white with little engagement with race or hip hop's roots as a Black American cultural form. This status quo was disrupted by the rise of Afro-Finnish rappers. Since gaining mainstream visibility, they have catapulted into the national consciousness with music that reclaims the language of racial and ethnic identities, interrogates assumptions about national belonging, and represents the lived experiences of first-generation Black/Afro-Finnish men. Approaching hip hop as a resource for resisting normative Whiteness and carving out space for Black/African diasporic collectivities in the Finnish cultural and political imaginary, I show how Afro-Finnish rappers articulate and navigate Blackness in relation to identity, racism, and national belonging in Finland. In doing so, I emphasise the tensions between racial, ethnic, and cultural hybridity, on the one hand, and the rigidity of Finnish Whiteness and national exclusion, on the other.

AB  - Developments in national fisheries and marine environmental policies during the last 30 years have changed the relationship between coastal communities and the marine resources that people in these communities traditionally harvested. In Norway, for example, when the state authorities have made decisions to defend what they regard as national interests, the local level has been left with authority over minor issues related to area planning in the coastal zone. Although coastal planning until recently was about sharing fishing areas between different users, we now see a spatial dimension emerging in planning, giving it a much broader scope. The processes of defining spatial properties and creating coastal space as a governable object have the potential to empower local communities. These processes contribute to enhanced local control and improved local participation in the governance of natural resources. In Norway, the 2008 Planning and Building Act strengthened the role of municipalities in local planning. In addition, the application of a new three-dimensional, spatial approach to coastal planning may create opportunities for new control over local resources. In marine spatial planning (MSP) the natural resources are seen as part of coastal spatial properties; thus, governing of sea space implies resource governance. As our examples illustrate, considerable power is associated with the ability to identify and define the properties of coastal space. MSP could become an important tool for controlling local resources, rebuilding collapsed fisheries, and managing them sustainably at the level of municipalities.

AB  - Ecosystem based management (EBM) is an ocean management theory that examines an ecosystem holistically, accounting for both human uses and natural processes. EBM has gained popularity due to growing conflicts over ocean space, fueled by increasing demands for natural resources and a rising awareness for environmental values. EBM asserts that by scoping short-term natural resource exploitation to allow for the preservation of the ecosystem's core structure and function, sustainable long-term exploitation can be achieved. Therefore, determining the ecosystem's structure and function is a main tenet to EBM. To translate EBM theory to practice, important ecological areas, or "ecological hotspots," are identified to understand the core ecosystem spaces that drive overall function. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a process in which to operationalize EBM theory, including ecological hotspots. The literature has taken time to assess EBM from the theoretical perspective, however few studies exist that examine EBM-MSP interactions as EBM theory is translated into practice and secondly compare approaches across countries. This paper focuses on a comparative analysis of how ecological hotspots were (or are being) identified within two ecosystems, the Barents Sea and Gulf of Maine. The EBM ocean plans to be assessed are the Norwegian Barents Sea-Lofoten ocean management plan (BSMP) and the U.S. Northeast Ocean Plan (NEOP). It is found that the motivating factors that prompted the development of the BSMP and NEOP influenced when and how quickly ecological hotspots were determined. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion revolving around how EBM-MSP decision-making processes are operationalized.

AB  - Contradictory attitudes towards lynx Lynx lynx management in Finland have emerged as a consequence of rapid growth of the lynx population together with the strict protection and conservation objectives determined by the European Union. In this study, conducted during 2004-2005, we examined local people's and stakeholders opinions about lynx management through a nationwide survey.We also assessed local people's opinions through comments expressed at public meetings. which were recorded, transcribed and analysed. In gneral, lynx were seen as an important part of Finnish nature and its biodiersity, but it was also seen as a detriment to sustaining game populations. Hunters who manage roe deer capreolus capreolus or white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus or hare Lepus spp. populations were especially negative. Hunting and improved public awareness were considered the most effective methods to incease peopl's tolerance towards lynx and the damage they might cause. Stakeholders were interested in development of the existing damage compensation system and clear rules concerning management of problem inidividuals. In contrast to hunters, conservationists emphasised the conservation status of lynx and rejected the idea of population regulation through hunting. many aspectys of management were accepted by all stakeholders:other aspects were more controversial. To resolve the conflict betweeen stakeholders regarding lynx management. compromise and cooperation will be required from stakeholders holding conflicting views. This may aid lynx management and also the conservation of the species in Finland in the future.

AB  - The capacity consumption in the Swedish network is high. Banverket (Swedish Rail Administration) declared Stockholm congested in April 2007. In October 2007 the lines Olskroken-Savedalen and Iggesund-Sundsvall were declared congested due to conflicts between different traffic operators during the capacity allocation process. Each year since 2001 Banverket has been calculating the capacity consumption for the Swedish network. It has been done manually. For studying capacity measures timetable analysis with Trainplan or traffic simulations with Railsys are made. Capacity measures are normally infrastructure investments, timetable alternatives or punctuality. For traffic simulations with Railsys, Banverket and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) have established a Swedish Railsys user-group. This user-group is working with standardisation for using Railsys in Sweden. There is a small consultant market for traffic simulations in Sweden. In Trainplan the running times are produced by the software tools Tigris - PcGTP.

AB  - Compared to many other countries, Sweden has managed the COVID-19 pandemic with no lockdowns, less regulation and more voluntary action expected of citizens and organizations. In this article, the authors explore media representations of national preventative strategies and how they were anchored in broader discourses. The article aims to analyse the development of crisis narratives and struggles over legitimacy during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Employing a critical discourse analysis, the authors investigate the editorials and opinion articles in Sweden's largest morning newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, during the spring of 2020. The authors combine descriptive analyses of the development of the crisis narratives with discursive analyses of conflicting ideologies in the debate. The study indicates that three crisis narratives dominated the debates: health, the economy and democracy. Within and between these narratives, struggles over legitimacy in the handling of COVID-19 were captured in several conflicting perspectives or paradoxes: Swedish exceptionalism versus the world, centralization versus decentralization and herd immunity versus herd humanism.

AB  - A comparative case study in Naganobori Japan and Falun Sweden of runoff water from copper mines shows that the water and its particulates, filtered with a cutoff of 0.45 mu m, have different lead isotope ratios pointing to different origins for the lead. While the larger particles have a lead ratio indicative of the atmospheric anthropogenic pollution the soluble lead has that of the copper ores. The domestic atmospheric lead ratio in Japan is homogeneous and characteristic of emissions from the incineration of waste. Lead pollution transported from the Asian continent by westerly winds can be distinguished from the Japanese pollution by its more thorogenic lead ratios, in for example analyses of copper moss from Naganobori.

AB  - Intensification of agriculture has been proposed as one way of minimizing emissions per unit of product, apparently legitimizing the ongoing structural changes in agriculture. We have investigated the relationship between the farming intensity and the nitrogen (N) dissipation by calculating the overall N emission factor (E total N surplus per unit of N in the produce) from several studies of dairy farms, covering a wide range of environments and production intensities. Fundamental steps were 1) the distinction between trophic levels, mineral, plant and animal N; and 2) the inclusion of N losses related to bought feed. The results; show that E increases significantly with the production intensity of the dairy farm. The tradition for separate optimization of the animal and crop sectors may be a reason. We suggest that the N pollution can be mitigated by more extensive farming, both by re-coupling crop and animal production side by side, and by keeping land under cultivation when production is reduced.

AB  - Aquaculture in Norway is expected to grow radically in the years to come. From both the government and from the industry itself, there is a demand for developing policies that can accommodate this intensification in activity. However, the aquaculture industry in Norway is also met with considerable skepticism and resistance. Both NGOs and several researchers have voiced concerns in the media, expressing a need for more insight into this resistance. This article explores the attitudes of local residents and stakeholder groups towards aquaculture through a qualitative field study in a small coastal community. Data shows that attitudes are not necessarily a matter of being for or against aquaculture. The issue at stake is sustainability, as what residents and stakeholder groups want is sustainable aquaculture. However, how the different groups interpreted sustainability differed, both between groups and depending on the circumstances. Our analysis shows that interpretations are embedded in different world-views or orders of worth. In this article, we give empirical insight into the expressed attitudes of various stakeholder groups, discuss the underlying values and indicate possible implications these findings can have for policy-making in the Norwegian coastal zone.

AB  - Environmental benefits have become priority objectives for the management of forests, including for private forest owners in many countries. Understanding and promoting environmental-friendly private forest management requires a measure of environmental concern of forest owners and knowledge of factors that influence it. Such a measure allows to explore underlying motivations of forest owners to include environmental aspects in their forest management. This in turn helps in developing and implementing effective pro-environmental forestry policies. In this paper, we assess environmental concern in forest management of 226 non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners in Sweden. In particular, we sought to achieve a two-fold objective: a) to quantitatively explore the content and dimensionality of the environmental concern construct of forestry owners and b) to identify the association between environmental concern of forest owners and their personal values and personality traits. A principal factor analysis resulted in a two-dimensional environmental concern construct encompassing: environmental strategy and environmental orientation. Hierarchical seemingly unrelated regressions (SUREG) showed that personal values and personality traits help to explain environmental concern in forest management of NIPF owners. A better understanding of environmental concern of forest owners and its relation with individuals' attributes will help in better designing, framing and targeting of tailor-made interventions to promote environmental considerations in forest management.

AB  - We reintroduced the endangered Baton Blue butterfly (Pseudophilotes baton schiffermuelleri, Bergstrasser) from its last known Finnish population to a site where it had become extinct. The butterfly is associated with dry and open eskers, but because of drastic habitat degradation only one population is known to have survived in Finland. The main reason for habitat loss is succession of pine forests. The last verified records of the species at the site of reintroduction date from 1984. The habitat was managed by the selective logging of pines in 1992. In 1994, after vegetation followups, 10 female baron blues were translocated. The introduced population was studied with the mark-recapture method in 1995-1996. Its size increased during this period to ca. 50 butterflies in 1996. Reintroduction, accomplished in close cooperation with forest industry, administration authorities and environmentalists, has diminished the probability of extinction of the baton blue in Finland.

AB  - The ability to predict the patch occurrence of a deciduous forest bird guild through an indicator species was tested using published data. Except for the indicator, the Long-tailed Tit (LT), the guild consisted of the Marsh Tit (MT), the Blue Tit (BT) and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (LW). All single species, as well as the entire guild, occurred more often like LT than expected by chance. Over all, 86% of the guild occurred in concurrence with LT. When LT was present the mean number of guild species was 3.52 and when absent 0.79. The occurrence pattern of the guild did not change when one multi-sampled region in Sweden was compared with patches scattered throughout four countries, whereas concurrence was more significant in studies from the boreal zone than from the nemoral zone. The guild showed a nested structure in patch occupancy, where the occurrence of LW strongly predicted that of the entire guild. However, because of the better overall statistical agreement in relation to the guild, the Long-tailed Tit, or rather, its known thresholds regarding habitat fragmentation, are suggested as suitable indicators for the occurrence of this guild.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that organizational change depends on societal narratives - narratives about the character, history, or envisioned future of societies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study of a Swedish municipal waste management company serves as an illustration.
   Findings - Swedish waste governance is powered by two main narratives: "less landfilling" and "wasting less". Less landfilling has been the dominant narrative for several decades, but wasting less is gaining momentum, and a new narrative order is establishing itself. This new narrative order significantly redefines the socio-material status of waste and imposes major changes on waste management organizations.
   Research limitations/implications - Based on the case of waste governance in Sweden, the authors conclude that organizations should be aware that societal narrative affects the legitimacy and nature of their operations; therefore, they must integrate a watch for narrative change in their strategic reflections.
   Originality/value - This paper establishes the relevance of the notion of societal narrative to understand organizational change.

AB  - This paper investigates the factors associated with the (non)adoption of eco-certification among the nature-based tourism companies in the Scandinavian region. Previous research suggested that the popularity of tourism eco-certification schemes remained limited in the region due to socio-cultural, historical and other specifics. We revisit this query a decade later with the support of nation-wide data from two Scandinavian countries - Norway and Sweden. The quantitative results suggest that such factors as motivations for operating a nature-based tourism business, beliefs about eco-certification effects, economic and demographic characteristics, are associated with the eco-certification adoption. Qualitative insights shed more light on the existing barriers for this sustainability approach in the region. The results suggest that companies with strong beliefs in the positive context (i.e. beliefs that eco-certification is capable to generate higher income, more customers and provide marketing advantage), lifestyle and sustainability-oriented business goals together with favorable organizational context (larger size, higher income and having a female leader) are more likely to invest in an eco-certification scheme.

AB  - Cadmium accumulation in arable soils causes concern due to possible direct environmental effects and health risks associated with exposure of humans to cadmium through agricultural products. This paper discusses the problem of cadmium accumulation in Swedish arable land, and evaluates Salix (Salix vinimalis) cultivation as a tool for addressing the problem. It is found that Salix cultivation offers an effective option for addressing the cadmium accumulation, especially when the topsoil has high cadmium content due to anthropogenic inflows, and the subsoil naturally contains little cadmium. The estimated practical potential for Salix-based cadmium management (ca. 490 000 ha) is very large compared to the present Salix plantation area in Sweden (ca. 15 000 ha). However, the estimates of the net economic value of cadmium removal from arable land indicate that the economics of Salix production will not improve dramatically due to an induced cadmium removal. Salix-based cadmium management will therefore most likely take place in counties where Salix cultivation can be expected to expand as a response to an unfilled biomass demand in the energy sector.

AB  - Renewable sources of energy should become increasingly important for Sweden, unless policies change regarding reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and phasing out of nuclear power. Greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere may cause considerable climate change in northern latitudes. In the Nordic region, increases in temperature and precipitation, over the next several decades, could change the availability of renewable energy. Climate change scenarios suggest that both hydropower and biomass potentials would increase considerably in Sweden. Bioenergy from forestry could be adversely affected by rapid climate change, while short rotation biomass production would adapt more readily to changing environmental conditions. Impacts of climate change on wind and direct solar energy are difficult to assess, due to uncertainties in future changes of wind variability and cloudiness. Available information on the possible consequences of climate change provides arguments for further utilization of renewable resources in Sweden, provided that future climate uncertainties and climate-adaptive measures are considered in energy planning.

AB  - Assessments of river restoration outcomes are mostly based on taxonomic identities of species, which may not be optimal because a direct relationship to river functions remains obscure and results are hardly comparable across biogeographic borders. The use of ecological species trait information instead of taxonomic units may help to overcome these challenges.
   Abundance data for fish communities were gathered from 134 river restoration projects conducted in Switzerland, Germany and Finland, monitored for up to 15 years. These data were related to a dataset of 22 categories of ecological traits describing fish life-history strategies to assess the outcome of the restoration projects. Restoration increased trait functional diversity and evenness in projects that were situated in the potamal zone of rivers. Restoration effect increased with the length of the restored river reaches. In areas with low levels of anthropogenic land use, the peak of the restoration effect was reached already within one to five years after the restoration and effect receded thereafter, while communities responded later in areas with higher levels of anthropogenic land use.
   In the lower potamal zone, a shift towards opportunistic life-history strategists was observed. In the upper rhithral zone, in contrast, species with an opportunistic life-history strategy increased only in the first five years of restoration, followed by a shift towards equilibrium strategists at restorations older than 5 years. This pattern was more pronounced in rivers with higher level of anthropogenic land use and longer restored river reaches. Restoration reduced the variability in community trait composition between river reaches suggesting that community trait composition within these zones converges when rivers are restored.
   This study showed how ecological traits are suitable to analyse restoration outcomes and how such an approach can be used for the evaluation and comparison of environmental management actions across geographical regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study investigated cross-cultural differences in road traffic risk perception, risk sensitivity and risk willingness in Norway, Russia, India, Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda. Differences in driver attitudes and driver behaviour were also examined. An additional aim was to test whether the risk constructs and driver attitudes explained the variation in risky driver behaviour in these countries. To obtain these aims, a questionnaire survey was conducted among a randomly obtained representative sample of the Norwegian public (n = 247). Stratified samples were established in Russia (n = 245), India (n = 196), Ghana (n = 299), Tanzania (n = 559) and Uganda (n = 415). The respondents completed a questionnaire which consisted of validated self-reported measures of the risk constructs, and driver attitudes and behaviour. Norwegians reported safer attitudes regarding drinking and driving, and speeding in road traffic. These respondents also reported more seat belt use and lower frequencies of drinking and driving than the remaining subsamples. Respondents from Sub-Saharan Africa reported higher road traffic risk perceptions and risk sensitivity than respondents from Norway, Russia and India. Respondents from Tanzania reported the highest willingness to take risks both in traffic and in general. Participants from Sub-Saharan Africa and India reported safer attitudes in regard to speaking out to an unsafe driver, rule violations and sanctions, attitudes towards pedestrians, and traffic rules and knowledge. Respondents from Sub-Saharan Africa also reported more precautious behaviour and less speeding. The predictive model of driver behaviour explained a satisfactory amount of variance in Norway, Russia and India, but was poorly fitted in the African countries. The results are discussed in line with the general risk environments and the road traffic systems in high-and low-income countries. Challenges related to measuring road traffic attitudes and behaviour in low-income countries are also discussed.

AB  - Sustainable development is a global issue, but for many people it is most meaningful to discuss sustainability at the local level, where people live their daily lives. Civil and environmental engineers (CEE) most often are dealing with local level tasks, and their designs are influencing human behaviour and thereby having an impact on the local communities' sustainability outcome. This paper describes Norwegian CEE students' experiences, gained from guided study-tours to Copenhagen and Malmo during the past three years. An annual three-day study-tour is arranged as part of three simultaneously offered courses: 'Integrated Land Use and Transport Planning', 'Environmental Engineering' and 'Architecture Theory and History'. The purpose of this study is to investigate which learning outcomes our students had from the urban districts visited, and how they evaluate the sustainability measures witnessed. Auditing is based on the students' knowledge acquisition from these three courses and previous courses through their studies. From their case-studies in Orestad (Copenhagen) and Western Harbour (Malmo), the students' group reports are describing themes like local climate, human scale, traffic safety, urban drainage systems (SUDS), landscape and open spaces, green roofs, crime prevention (CPTED), and universal design. By walking around, students become aware of qualities that should be implemented in local planning and design processes. From the students' group reports we can see that students are able to reflect on local sustainability outcomes, recommend further improvements and discuss their results related to sustainability theories and planning history.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse how adventure is constructed and represented as an experience to purchase and to examine the particularities of a process of commodification of adventure transforming a theoretical concept into a range of activities labelled as adventure. Sweden and Switzerland are two countries that offer adventure tourism through similar activities but yet in a different geographical and cultural context. Written messages produced by the national tourism boards of Sweden and Switzerland are analysed using a reading grid that incorporates the main components of the concept of adventure tourism as identified in the literature. The theoretical foundations of adventure are compared with its empirical foundations once translated into experiences to purchase. The analysis reveals that the two sets of discourses mostly gravitate around the same themes: first, a strong emphasis on safety and comfort but paradoxically on thrill as well, second, an adventure represented as a unique, authentic and sometimes even spiritual experience that almost everyone can access, and third, surprisingly no reference made in the promotion material to two notions essential to the theoretical concept of adventure: risk and uncertainty.

AB  - Of the EU countries, Sweden utilizes the highest proportion (10%) of its total agricultural land for horses. Horse paddocks commonly hold horses on a limited space, in the present study at a rate of 5-14 livestock units ha(-1). Thus these paddocks receive significant amounts of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) through feed residues and deposition of faeces and urine, which can lead to nutrient build-up in the soil. This study examined soil P and N status in different parts of horse paddocks (feeding, grazing and excretion areas) and compared it with that in adjacent, unmanaged reference soils. The paddock areas were then categorized with respect to environmental risk using the threshold concentrations of plant-available P extracted with ammonium acetate lactate solution at pH 3.75 (P-AL) and total N set by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. In total, seven horse farms, covering different grazing densities and soil textures representative of Swedish horse paddocks, were examined. The results showed that concentrations of water-soluble P (WSP), P-AL, and total N were highest in feeding and excretion areas within the paddocks. Weighted concentrations of soil P for the whole paddocks amounted to 2.9-10.5 mg WSP (kg(-1)) and 35-224 mg P-AL (kg(-1)), and were higher than in the corresponding reference fields (0.8-4.9 mg WSP (kg(-1)) and 17-102 mg P-AL (kg(-1))). The WSP concentration in the paddocks was strongly correlated with horse density (R-2 = 0.80***(1), n = 13) and P-AL with years of paddock management (R-2 = 0.78***, n = 13). Total organic C was significantly correlated with P-AL, total P and total N in the feeding and excretion areas. The degree of soil P saturation (DPS) concentrations was important soil parameters determining WSP concentration in the paddocks (R-2 = 0.63***, n = 110), whereas total P concentration in soils was determining P-AL concentrations (R-2 = 0.82***, n = 112). According to Swedish environmental guidelines, two of the seven farms studied posed a high risk and three a moderate risk of extensive P leaching losses, but the risk of extensive N losses was moderate for all farms studied. As regards the specific sections of the paddock, the feeding and excretion areas had the highest risk of P leaching losses. Thus paddock soils can be high-risk areas for P leaching comprising about 3.85% of the total high-risk land area in Sweden. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim The diversity and composition of natural communities are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic disturbances. Magnitude of this compositional reorganization varies across the globe, but reasons behind the variation remain largely unknown. Disturbances induce temporal turnover by stimulating species colonizations, causing local extinctions, altering dominance structure, or all of these. We test which of these processes drive temporal community changes, and whether they are constrained by natural environmental gradients. Moreover, we assess to what degree identity shifts translate to changes in dominance structure.
   Location Finland.
   Time period Observations 1985-2006, disturbance history > 140 years.
   Major taxa studied Vascular plants.
   Methods We investigated temporal turnover of boreal forest understorey in response to disturbance, here forest management, along a soil fertility gradient. We disentangle the roles of species gains, losses and abundance changes in driving temporal turnover in response to and after disturbance by comparing turnover rates in different forest age categories along a fertility gradient. We quantify temporal turnover using richness-based complement of Jaccard's similarity index and proportional-abundance based dissimilarity index. We also test whether disturbance history or fertility influence the relationship between identity shifts and dominance structure.
   Results We found that the impact of disturbance on temporal turnover depends on soil fertility. The greatest turnover occurred in the most fertile forests immediately after disturbance. There, species gains and losses strongly altered dominance structure leading to high turnover, whereas undisturbed old forests and nutrient-poor habitats were characterized by stable dominant species even when the majority of species shifted their identity.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that human impacts on temporal biodiversity change vary along environmental gradients. In boreal forests, the fertile habitats have a higher probability than nutrient-poor sites of changing their composition in response to anthropogenic disturbances. Resource availability and disturbance history may thus influence consequences of temporal turnover for ecosystem functioning.

AB  - It is generally recognised that agricultural intensification has lead to simplification of landscape structure, but it has not been clarified if this is a ubiquitous relationship. That is, it has been an open question whether agricultural intensity and landscape simplicity should be regarded as one single or as two separate dimensions. To evaluate this we analysed landscape data in 136 different 1 km x 1 km study sites and within a buffer zone of 2 kill around each site (i.e. approximately 5 km x 5 km). The sites were distributed over a large part of the region of Scania, southernmost Sweden, an area dominated by agriculture but With large variation in both intensity and complexity. We used spatially explicit digital data on land use, digitised aerial photographs, field surveys of landscape elements and agricultural statistics. Two separate factor analyses, one for each scale of measurements (1 km and 5 km), suggest that there are five and three relevant factors for each scale respectively. At the 1 km scale, the first factor can be interpreted as describing the intensity of land use in the form of proportion arable land which is highly correlated to crop yield. The second and third factors are more connected to landscape structure and amount of small patches of semi-natural habitats. The fourth and fifth factors contain one major variable each: proportion pasture and leys respectively. The division of intensity and complexity related variables is less clear at a larger spatial scale. At the 5 km scale, factor I is defined almost identically as at the 1 km scale. However, factors 2 and 3 are interpreted as descriptors of dairy and livestock farming systems but also include structural variables. Our analyses suggest that land use intensity and structural complexity of landscapes are more or less separate landscape level factors, at least at smaller spatial scales. This is important to bear in mind, especially when trying to explain patterns of biodiversity change in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exergy is applied to the Swedish energy supply system for the period 1970-2013. Exergy flow diagrams for the systems of electricity and district heating as well as for the total supply system of energy and material resources for 2012 are presented. The share of renewable use has increased in both electricity and district heat production. The resource use is discussed in four sectors: residential and service, transportation, industry and agriculture. The resource use is also analyzed with respect to exergy efficiency and renewable share. The total exergy input of energy and material resources amounts to about 2700 PJ of which about 530 PJ was used for final consumption in 2012. The results are also compared with similar studies. Even though the share of renewable resource use has increased from 42% in 1980 to 47% in 2012, poor efficiency is still occurring in transportation, space heating, and food production. A strong dependence on fossil and nuclear fuels also implies a serious lack of sustainability. A more exergy efficient technology and a higher renewable energy share are needed in order to become a more sustainable society.

AB  - Municipal water sectors shift from building traditional grey stormwater infrastructure to ambitious plans for holistic blue-green infrastructure due to climate vulnerability. The shift requires new ways of thinking, working, and collaborating, and we need to understand and address the new planning challenges the shift creates. While existing stormwater literature explores a range of technical, institutional, and ?nancial barriers to alternative stormwater implementation, we hold the shift requires a deeper understanding of holistic and flexible stormwater management approaches. In this context, we investigate adaptive challenges like norms, practices, uncertainty, and new ways of collaborating across sectors in alternative stormwater planning in Norway. The studied planning processes exemplify how the need for making stormwater measures legally binding in municipal planning changes work practices in municipal water sectors. A novelty of the paper is that it shows how water departments take leadership of formal planning processes and adopt the planning department's language and working methods. We find that the studied municipalities promote cross-sectoral collaborative approaches that create space for professional negotiation and mediation and invite a deeper understanding of other's interests and views. We hold that such approaches could contribute to more holistic and flexible planning approaches, securing long-term sustainable stormwater management.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss implications of different resolution scales of both time and space in studies of past land use and past vegetation, both historical and palaeoecological. The paper gives examples of short term-variation, long-term changes, small spatial scale differences and regional differences in land use, studied through historical sources in four regions in south central Sweden. It also discusses the difficulty of interpretation of forest vegetation in old cadastral maps. Historical sources can show dynamics on the fine temporal and spatial scales that are difficult to capture with pollen analysis. On the other hand, pollen analysis has unique possibilities for the study of time periods where historical records are lacking. Therefore the combination of several disciplines is likely to be productive in aiding understanding past land use and vegetation. However, there are important limitations in using the information in cadastral maps and other historical sources to interpret and quantify past vegetation.

AB  - We studied tree regeneration, a key process for the existence of urban woodlands. We hypothesized that, besides the usual biological factors, anthropogenic ones (fragmentation, wear, pollution etc.) determine the regeneration success of tree species in urban woodlands. To test this hypothesis, within an observational setting, we collected data from 30 urban woodlands in the cities of Helsinki and Vantaa, Finland. We defined the number of living saplings (30-200 cm in height) as an indicator of regeneration success and used regression analysis to test different factors as independent variables. The results showed that different tree species responded differently to urban pressure. The regeneration of Picea abies decreased with increasing fragmentation of the forest landscape, whereas for the other most common (deciduous) species, regeneration increased. Wear, measured as total path area per study site, had a negative effect on regeneration success. An a posteriori examination of the data suggested that coarse woody debris might promote regeneration. We conclude that, although tree regeneration in general is not threatened in urban woodlands in the area we studied, the species composition may gradually change. We discuss some management implications for counteracting the urban pressures on tree regeneration.

AB  - Focusing on Danish comedian Jonatan Spang's spoof of the Nordic dramaThe Bridgevia his news parody seriesClose to the Truth, this article examines how satire simultaneously embodies and performs geopolitics. Through a close reading of Spang's send-up of contemporary Swedish culture as "pc-totalitarianism", we interrogate the comedian's satirical intervention in bilateral cultural relations between Denmark and Sweden. Our approach begins with a critical assessment of Danish national identity vis-a-vis the Swedish "other", followed by a brief history of Danish political satire, before shifting to an empirical analysis of Spang's controversialDramanskit across four spatio-cultural scales of engagement. In the concluding section, we integrate the various flows of satirical stereotyping, national identity production (and contestation), and geopolitics embedded in Spang's "humoristic Marshall Plan" for Sweden. Here, our goal is to provide a multi-tiered assessment of how comedy informs everyday understandings of International Relations (IR) between culturally-proximate nations.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the greatest threats for biodiversity. In Finland, two thirds of natural mires have been drained for silviculture, which transforms open wetlands into dense forests. However, vegetation management of power line rights-of-way (ROW) maintain the drained mires as open areas. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the power line ROW vegetation management on butterfly abundance, species richness and community structure by comparing the managed power line ROWs to unmanaged drained control sites and to natural mires. The species richness or abundance of mire butterflies did not differ between the power line ROWs and natural mires. In contrast, both species richness and abundance of butterflies was low on the unmanaged control sites. Tree canopy cover had a negative effect on mire butterflies and this is most likely related to changes in microclimate. The results indicate that the active vegetation removal in the power line ROWs maintain alternative habitats for mire butterflies; yet, the power line ROWs cannot substitute the natural mires.

AB  - Arctic freshwaters support biota adapted to the harsh conditions at these latitudes, but the climate is changing rapidly and so are the underlying environmental filters. Currently, we have limited understanding of broad-scale patterns of Arctic riverine biodiversity and the correlates of alpha- and beta-diversity. Using information from a database set up within the scope of the Arctic Council's Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Plan, we analysed patterns and correlates of alpha- and beta-diversity in benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate communities across northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We analysed variation in total beta-diversity and its replacement and richness difference components in relation to location of the river reach and its drainage basin (Baltic Sea in the south, the Barents Sea in the east and the north, and the Norwegian Sea in the west), in addition to climate and environmental variables. In both macroinvertebrates and diatoms, the replacement and richness difference components showed wide variation. For macroinvertebrates, the richness difference component was the more important, whereas for diatoms, the replacement component was the more important in contributing to variation in beta-diversity. There was no significant difference in beta-diversity between the three main drainage basins, but species composition differed among the drainage basins. Based on the richness difference component of beta-diversity, climate variables were most strongly associated with community variation in macroinvertebrates. In diatoms, both environmental and climate variables were strongly correlated with community compositional variation. In both groups, there were also significant differences in alpha-diversity among the three main drainage basins, and several taxa were significant indicators of one of these drainage basins. Alpha diversity was greater in areas with a continental climate, while the oceanic areas in the west harboured greatly reduced flora and fauna. The correlates of biodiversity were relatively similar in macroinvertebrates and diatoms. Climate variables, in particular temperature, were the most strongly associated with biodiversity patterns in the Arctic rivers of Fennoscandia. Sedimentary geology may be associated with increased productivity and, to a lesser extent, with sensitivity to acidification. There was considerable variation in community composition across Arctic Fennoscandia, indicating the necessity of protecting several stream reaches or even whole catchments within each region to conserve total riverine biodiversity. Furthermore, it is likely that the predicted changes in temperature in Arctic areas will influence riverine diversity patterns across Fennoscandia.

AB  - Seasonal variation in home-range size and habitat area requirement of lesser spotted woodpeckers (Dendrocopos minor) were studied by radio-tracking in southern Sweden for 6 years. Home-range size did not vary between age-groups or sexes, but varied with season and decreased successively from 742 ha in winter (n = 10), 355 ha in early spring (n = 15), 103 ha in late spring (n = 22) to 43 ha during nesting (n = 10). The home-range in late spring (i.e. the 3-5 weeks preceeding egg-laying) represents the defended breeding territory. This included on average 39 ha of forest utilised for foraging (range 31-46 ha, n = 15). Since food availability in late spring has a significant influence on reproductive success, and mortality is highest in this period, we regard this as an estimate of the habitat area requirement. This estimate is valid primarily for birds in southern Sweden, but circumstantial evidence indicate that the area requirement may not be grossly different in other areas with different forest types. For conservation of lesser spotted woodpeckers, management should focus on a minimum of 40 ha of forest dominated by deciduous trees, which may be fragmented over a maximum of 200 ha, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The Minister of the Environment honoured Kristiansand with "Prize for the best environmental city": "Kristiansand gets the prize for it's long-term effort of town development in a sustainable perspective. I hope this prize will inspire the towns to put even more emphasis on the environment. Kristiansand is the example of the best practise, I hope other towns can learn from Kristiansand." "Hardly any other town in Norway have such a breadth in the work to develop a good town environment as Kristiansand."
   Looking behind the rhetoric, it is difficult to see what merits this honour. The city of Kristiansand was appointed "Sustainable City" in a 7-year demonstration project, starting in 1993. But in retrospect and continuing the urban region is expanding, the journey to work is increasing and so is the use of the private car. The political attitudes seem to have become more environmentally friendly. Plans and programmes aiming at sustainability and better environment are prolific. True to say, there have been huge investments in repairing former sins but still, in comparison, the road investment was far greater. How can the divide between the Minister's rhetoric and substantive indicators be explained?
   In a case study looking at land-use and transport policy in Kristiansand from the mid-eighties to date, we are searching for answers along three lines. Firstly, the planners' ideology was Predict and Prevent (stop the car growth, increase public transport). The established institutions however, followed the paradigm Predict and Provide (car use increases, provide more road capacity), and the winner was? An interesting result of the study was that the decision makers contrary to the planners, fast moved on and focused upon the global economy and competition between cities. Their ideology may be called Predict and Promote.

AB  - Biofuels are introduced in the transportation sector as a means to reduce the sector's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. European and other national and global standardization schemes for biofuels also include certain minimum GHG emission reduction among the requirements to be met. Assessments of the GHG performance of biofuels are complex due to the complexities of physical, chemical, and biological conversion processes, feedstock diversity, and variability in site-specific environmental conditions. Differences may also arise in analytical approaches, including in how direct and indirect land use change is accounted for. Current production of first-generation ethanol in Sweden, based on wheat, causes relatively low GHG emissions, whereas a future expansion may cause increased emissions from changes in land use and less optimal utilization of by-products. Such negative impacts may be avoided by an introduction and expansion of second-generation ethanol based on lignocellulosic feedstock (e.g., straw, short rotation coppice, and forest residues), which eventually could become the major feedstock in ethanol production. This transition to low, indirect impact ethanol systems creates an opening for a significant expansion of ethanol in the transport sector without compromising the sizeable climate benefits and sustainable resource exploitation.

AB  - One of the corner stones of socially and culturally sustainable development in the context of tourist resorts is that the local population is able to participate to the development of the resort. Planning legislation also recognises the importance of participation. However, it is not easy to define the relevant parties who should be involved. This is especially the case in such unique and new entities as tourist resorts are in their rural environments. This study focused through group discussions on the points-of-view of different parties at the tourist resorts of Yllas and Levi in Finnish Lapland. These discussions revealed that lay citizens have a strong desire to participate in the planning processes, and they have huge expectations for the Land-use and Building Act 2000, which demands the hearing of all parties involved. The permanent residents at the ski resorts are concerned about the sustainability issues, but such groups as second homeowners and seasonal workers are also interested in participating. New channels and new modes for participation are needed, and face-to-face interaction seems to be more popular than communicating opinions through the Internet.

AB  - The last decades have shown a surge in studies focusing on the interplay between fragmented habitats, genetic variation, and conservation. In the present study, we consider the case of a temperate pond-breeding anuran (the common toad Bufo bufo) inhabiting a naturally strongly fragmented habitat at the Northern fringe of the species' range: islands offshore the Norwegian coast. A total of 475 individuals from 19 populations (three mainland populations and 16 populations on seven adjacent islands) were genetically characterized using nine microsatellite markers. As expected for a highly fragmented habitat, genetic distances between populations were high (pairwise F-st values ranging between 0.06 and 0.33), with however little differences between populations separated by ocean and populations separated by terrestrial habitat (mainland and on islands). Despite a distinct cline in genetic variation from mainland populations to peripheral islands, the study populations were characterized by overall high genetic variation, in line with effective population sizes derived from single-sample estimators which were on average about 20 individuals. Taken together, our results reinforce the notion that spatial and temporal scales of fragmentation need to be considered when studying the interplay between landscape fragmentation and genetic erosion.

AB  - The spatial variability in the mix of species making up Cold-water coral reef communities is not well known. In this study abundances of a selection of megafauna (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Paragorgia arborea, Primnoa resedaeformis, Mycale lingua, Geodia baretti, Acesta excavata and fish) were quantified throughout 9 manned submersible video transects from 3 reef complexes (Rost Reef, Sotbakken Reef and Traena Reef) on the Norwegian margin. Substrate type (coral structure, rubble, exposed hardground or soft sediment) was also recorded. Variations in the densities of these fauna (with respect to both reef complex and substrate type) were investigated, with spatial covariance between species assessed.
   For the majority of fauna investigated, densities varied by both reef and substrate. Spatial covariance indicated that some species may be utilising similar habitat niches, but that minor environmental differences may favour colonisation by one or other at a particular reef. Fish densities were generally higher in regions with biogenic substrate (coral structure and coral rubble substrates) than in areas of soft or hardground substrate. Further, fish were more abundant at the northerly Sotbakken Reef at time of study than elsewhere. Community structure varied by reef, and therefore management plans aimed at maintaining the biodiversity of reef ecosystems on the Norwegian margin should take this lack of homogeneity into account.

AB  - Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) covers extensive areas of the mountains of western Noah America. It has evolved into four subspecies, each adapted to slightly different environmental conditions. All are adapted to reproduce following fire. Subspecies latifolia is the most extensive and economically important in North America. Serotiny is common in this subspecies, but trees bearing nonserotinous cones can be found in most stands, sometimes constituting more that 70% of the trees. Cone crops are produced yearly and seed loss to seed predators, insects and diseases are minimal. Germination and establishment occurs across a broad range of conditions allowing lodgepole pine to grow on poor sites as well as highly productive sites. These characteristics give lodgepole pine the ability to be highly invasive in new areas of suitable habitat. Published by Elsevier Science.

AB  - Purpose - Recent climate scenarios indicate that Sweden's southern region, Gotaland, will experience significant climate change over the coming century. Swedish forestry policy guidelines emphasize the need for risk spreading to reduce the potential adverse impacts of these changes. Risk spreading is defined here as reducing the vulnerability of a social-ecological system by increasing the heterogeneity of its ecological components. Risk spreading may be achieved through the diversification of tree species currently relied upon by the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to consider the capacity of the socio-ecological forest system to adapt to climate change through the use of risk spreading.
   Design/methodology/approach - A variety of disciplines contribute to the understanding of the rate at which risk spreading is likely to take place in a system. A synthesis is conducted to unite these insights.
   Findings - Five key constraints on the rate at which risk spreading can take place are identified. These include constraints imposed by the silvicultural system itself, voluntary policy measures, forest-owner perceptions of climate change, motivation among forest owners to respond to risk, and forestry consultants. Potential future directions are discussed and include the need for specifying the goal of risk spreading policy, and the need to evaluate the motivations of those forest owners already altering adopting risk spreading approaches.
   Originality/value - Conceptual equivalents of the "risk spreading" approach are international, due to the need for many societies to adapt social-ecological systems to climate change. The issues raised from this case study/synthesis provide value insights regarding the breadth of systemic constraints which can thwart attempts at rapid adjustment to climate change, and where solutions to these constraints may be found.

AB  - This article aims to reveal the political positioning of 'mire nature' in Finnish peatland policy and law. The data analysed include the latest policy documents, laws and regulations related to mires and peat extraction. Analysis is based on frame analysis (i.e. how an object is defined and positioned) and ideas drawn from a political ecology approach. Two main frames can be identified within the Finnish legal and policy framework: peat as a natural resource to be utilised for national energy sufficiency and economic competitiveness, and peat as a valuable source of biodiversity and an integral element of global ecosecurity. Analysis reveals the degree to which the definition of issues or objects in legal and policy terms is important in determining outcomes. It also reveals that national policies have swung back and forth and are prone to economic power struggles. Furthermore, while laws and regulations have offered strong and longstanding support for the extractive use of peat, the latest regulatory developments show a break from this trend. However, the arguments and facts concerning climate change are poorly integrated with Finnish peatland policy and law.

AB  - The use of shared storage warehouses in Norwegian museums has emerged in recent years as an effective way of saving resources and ensuring that cultural assets are adequately protected.
   This article and case study describes the work carried out in one of the biggest shared storage warehouses in Norway, located in a former munitions store near Stavanger, in the Rogaland region. It describes the efforts of the Samlingsteam Rogaland (Rogaland Collections Team), a travelling support unit assisting museums with cataloguing, digitisation, storage and conservation, created expressly to support museums and establish best practices in collection and storage management.
   Both offer innovative examples of the efficient use of resources dedicated to collection management and storage, which have been used as models to set up similar working systems in other areas of Norway.
   The existing literature is sparse both in reference to the storage warehouse and its transformation process as described in this case study, and to the Samlingsteam. The data used to assemble this case study was drawn from the professionals directly involved in the project, and their first-hand experiences as part of the working team. As such, this article represents a unique way of discovering the project and its completed work.

AB  - Flows of plant nutrients in the food and the fodder cycle were quantified in a district in southern Sweden. In the agricultural system with a livestock density 30% higher than the Swedish average, the N-surplus was 100 kg N ha(-1) and P-surplus was 9 kg P ha(-1) There is a relation between nutrient surpluses in agriculture and livestock density. A large part of the N-surplus is emitted as nitrate-N and ammonia-N while the P-surplus accumulates in the soil. The nutrients in the organic waste from the food consumption in the district corresponded to 22 kg N ha(-1) and 4 kg P ha(-1), the population density related to arable land was 15% higher than the Swedish average. Due to the present system of treatment of the surplus products from food consumption, 11% of P and less than 3% of N in the food intake were recycled back to arable land.

AB  - To analyse human influences on rural landscapes in present-day central and northern Europe and also to investigate sustainable landscape development concepts, an IALE (International Association for Landscape Ecology) regional Conference on 'Perspectives of Rural Landscapes in Europe' was held in Parnu, Estonia on 20-27 June 1996. The conference was undertaken specifically to exchange information between planners, managers, decision makers and scientists in the region. In the last few years, rural landscapes in Europe have changed significantly. Due to restructuring of agriculture in the European Union (EU) countries and radical socio-economic changes in eastern and central Europe, landscape change will continue. This stimulates interest for landscape ecologists to study the processes connected with such rapid development and to analyse its socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Different conference findings that resulted from six keynote speeches, 33 oral presentations, 21 posters and organised excursions (I-day conference excursion and 4-day post-conference excursion) are presented here. Thirteen papers published as part of this special issue of Landscape and Urban Planning, and summarised here, deal with general and methodological principles of the analysis of land use changes and related landscape evaluation, and also present case studies on land use changes from Estonia, Germany and Sweden.

AB  - The article examines the relationship between festivals, landscapes, and aesthetics. Since the 1960s there has been considerable growth in the numbers and types of festivals in the Western world, and in the creative use of landscape and environment as contexts and frames for many of these festivals. The article addresses two central questions: What are the characteristics of the phenomenon of festivals? In what ways do festivals in a Norwegian context relate to the landscape that both surrounds them and is part of their constitution? Using a theatrical metaphor, festivals and landscape can be perceived as instant cultural and aesthetic encounters in a performance space. The authors find that festivals as cultural events are characterized by social, aesthetic, and symbolic value, as well as cohesion, joy, openness, expressive, play, and diversity, and that experience is not exclusively individual but rather rooted in social and material interaction with other people and the environment. The approach is based on body-oriented, phenomenological, multisensous (synaesthetic) perspectives on festivals and landscapes. The article provides examples from four festivals in Norway.

   MethodsData on 321,274 self-employed persons were obtained from population registers in Sweden. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality rate ratios by industrial sector and enterprise legal form, adjusted for confounders.
   ResultsAll-cause mortality was 10-32% higher in self-employed persons in Manufacturing and Mining, Trade and Communication, and Not Specified and Other sectors than in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing. Mortality from cardiovascular disease was 23% higher in Trade and Communication, and from neoplasms 17-51% higher in Manufacturing and Mining, Not Specified, and Other. Mortality from suicide was 45-60% lower in Personal and Cultural Services, and in Not Specified. Mortality was 8-16% higher in sole proprietorship than limited partnership.

AB  - The boreal forest floor vegetation is critical for ecosystem functioning and an important part of forest biodiversity. Given the ongoing global change, knowledge on broad-scale changes in the composition and abundance of different plant species and species groups is hence important for both forest conservation and management. Here, we analyse permanent plot data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) on changes in the vegetation over a 10-year period in four regions of Sweden. To limit the direct and relatively well-known effects of forest management and associated succession, we only included mature forest stands not influenced by forestry during the 10 years between inventories, and focused on vegetation change mainly related to other factors. Results show strong decrease among many species and species groups. This includes dominant species such as Vaccinimum myrtillus and Deschampsia flexuosa as well as several forest herbs. The only species increasing are some mosses in the southern regions. Our data do not allow for a causal interpretation of the observed patterns. However, the changes probably result from latent succession in combination with climate change and nitrogen deposition, and with time lags complicating the interpretation of their relative importance. Regardless of the cause, the observed changes are on a magnitude that suggest impacts on ecosystem functioning and hence highlight the need for more experimental work.

AB  - Contemporary problems of housing architecture focus mainly on saving the environment and sustainable spatial planning. An equally important aspect of the environment is its impact on people. One of the determinants of space is its aesthetics. The use of modern, energy-saving building materials often changes this aesthetics. The aim of the work is to analyse selected elements of architecture and space affecting this aesthetics. New objects and spaces located in Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Norway were selected for the research. The main elements of the research are: the size of buildings, construction of buildings and organization of space. The study was based on subject literature and photographic documentation. Examples of specific technological elements of renewable energy used to build facilities are discussed. Analysis of the examples showed the correlation between aesthetics and pro-ecological technologies and building materials. The technologies used have a large impact on people in the architectural space, affect the comfort of use and the quality of this space.

The sites are clustered near the Arctic Circle, two from the islands of HusOy (Traena) and Lovund in the Helgeland region, and a potential third wreck from the small lake Fiskvagvatn in Saltdal. Available information from the wrecks is presented to provide a basis for assessing their cultural contexts and relevance to medieval maritime activities, the dried-cod (stockfish) trade in particular. The circumstances surrounding their discovery and documentation also offer insights into the history of cultural heritage management and role of community engagement in northern Norwegian shipwreck archaeology.

AB  - Recent research has focused on the impacts of environmental change to tourism. In particular, the perceived costs of climate change have been increasingly studied. However, the relationship between costs and benefits resulting from the changing environmental conditions for the industry has been less examined. This paper identifies the locally observed changes in the natural and socio-economic environments and aims to analyse the financial costs and benefits to tourism businesses in two tourism-dependent communities in northern Finland. The specific focus is on adaptation and adaptive management in a tourist destination scale. Adaption is understood as an investment creating not only implementation costs, but potentially also benefits for tourism operations. Research materials were collected among tourism and tourism-related businesses through 41 semi-structured thematic interviews. Results indicate that the evaluated benefits of environmental change seem to exceed those of costs. This conforms to the on-going discourse of climate change-tourism relations associated with the Arctic region where both awareness and vulnerability to change are considered relatively high but the level of responses, i.e. adaptation, low. These results can help to further identify the most vulnerable sectors in tourism and assist entrepreneurs preparing for environmental and climate change. However, the paper concludes that while global environmental change, with specific adaptive management strategies, may create local short-term direct benefits for the industry, a long-term sustainability of tourism in the Arctic calls for mitigation responses to climate change.

AB  - Pulses are important components in sustainable diets and cropping systems. This study evaluated the environmental impact of cultivation of five Swedish pulses (yellow peas, grey peas, faba beans, common beans and lentils) in a life-cycle perspective. The impact of selected Swedish pulses (conventional or organic) was then compared with that of imported pulses in Sweden, including contributions from processing, packaging and transport. The influence of origin and transportation mode and differences between home cooking and canned pulses (Tetra Recart) were considered.
   The impact of cultivation differed considerably between the Swedish pulses, ranging between 1.6-3.3 MJ, 0.18-0.44 kg CO2 e and 3.1-5.9 m(2) land use per kg dry product. In general, pulses with higher yield had lower cultivation impact. However, intercropping pulses and cereals showed potential to reduce environmental pressures, despite low per-hectare yield of the pulse crop. When processing, packaging and transport were included, the variation in impact was even greater, illustrating the importance of including post-farm activities in the assessment when comparing pulses. Emissions of greenhouse gases per kg cooked product ranged from 0.1 kg CO2 e for Swedish pulses purchased dry to 0.8 kg CO2 e for canned beans.
   Long transport distances contributed considerably to energy use and climate impact, particularly when the pulses were processed and packaged far from the final destination, due to high moisture content of the product. Origin affected also biodiversity impact, since the risk of species losses differs widely between ecoregions. Pesticide use is reported to be high in many countries, and residues are commonly found in many pulses. However, lack of data prevented comparisons of ecotoxicity or pesticide use for different imported pulses. The important role of origin and post-farm activities, in particular transport, for the environmental impact of pulses calls for increasing awareness and action amongst purchasers, food industries, and consumers to achieve more sustainable sourcing of pulses.

AB  - Implementing sustainable forest management (SFM) policy on the ground is not straightforward, and depends on the social-ecological context. To meet the need for place-based stakeholder collaboration towards regionally adapted knowledge production and learning in support of SFM an integrated landscape approach can assist. Hosting most of the circumboreal forest Russia is a key global player. To transition boreal forestry in the Russian Federation from wood mining towards SFM after the collapse of USSR several initiatives were initiated. Our aim is to review the outcomes and consequences of the initiatives employing the international Model Forest concepts' six principles in Russia. To identify candidates for the study we identified 12 local initiatives using this term, all in Russia's boreal forest biome. However, while seven demonstration forests focused on improving wood production practices, five were long-term stakeholder-driven development processes aimed at SFM, and were approved members of the International Model Forest Network. The five latter were selected for a detailed study to understand their temporal dynamic in the circumboreal Model Forest context, and the extent to which they complied with the six principles of the Model Forest concept as an example of a landscape approach. The sources, amounts and durations of these initiatives' funding affected both outcomes and consequences on the ground. All five had developed a partnership that formally shared a commitment to SFM. However, not all areas were large enough to represent all dimensions of SFM. Not all Model Forests developed a representative, participative, transparent, and accountable governance structure, which affected the programs of their activities. Finally, knowledge-sharing, capacity-building and networking at multiple levels was variable. In spite of Russia hosting most of the circumboreal forest the Model Forest concept was not sustained in Russia due to ending of foreign project funding, to limited continuity of committed local capacity, and poor support from national-level decision makers. The exception is the Komi Model Forest's transition to a successful consulting company focusing on SFM. To develop regionally adapted approaches to implement SFM policy we stress the importance of sharing experiences from Model Forests as well as other landscape approach concepts among countries and regions with different landscape histories and governance arrangements. To enhance this, we propose a general analytic framework for learning through evaluation about place-based long-term initiatives that integrate evidence-based knowledge about states and trends of sustainability and cross-sector multi-level governance.

AB  - Aim The dominant forces behind the expansion of Fagus sylvatica (beech) in northern Europe during the late Holocene have been much debated. Palaeoecological analyses were performed for a biodiversity hotspot reserve in order to study the processes behind the local establishment of Fagus, as well as the historical vegetational development in relation to present-day biodiversity and conservation.
   Location Biskopstorp Forest Reserve in south-west Sweden.
   Methods Pollen and charcoal were analysed from three small-hollow sites in the reserve. Two of the investigated wetlands were located adjacent to old-growth stands of Fagus, and the third was located near a stand of old Quercus.
   Results The 2500-year record shows that Fagus was first established around the two Fagus old-growth sites, c. AD 900 and 1200, respectively, and that this was followed by an expansion around AD 1600. During the establishment phase, and more so in the expansion phase, there were simultaneous increases in types of pollen indicative of human activity. These indicators are also frequent throughout the record from the Quercus site, but here Fagus never became common.
   Main conclusions The dynamics behind the establishment and expansion of Fagus in the reserve seems to have been influenced to a large degree by human activity, for example selective cutting, human-induced fires, and agriculture. Fagus became established in the reserve more than 1000 years after it became established regionally, making climate less probable as the dominant force behind the species' stand-scale establishment. The spreading of Fagus across southern Scandinavia has previously been shown to be a patchy process in time and space. Our study suggests that this patchiness is evident also at a small spatial scale (a few kilometres). At the Quercus site, relatively high amounts of pollen from the field layer throughout the record indicate open conditions that probably favoured Quercus. The degree of human impact at this site was probably too high to allow the expansion of Fagus. With the long-term perspective provided by our study it was possible to identify the last 200-300 years as an unrepresentative period with respect to tree species composition and forest dynamics. The large increase of Picea locally and regionally over the last several hundred years, combined with dramatic levels of human impact, have altered the tree composition and forest dynamics to such an extent that active management is necessary in order to maintain biodiversity in the reserve.

AB  - Based on a mixed-methods study of Norwegian second home users, this paper addresses travel distances, modes and carbon dioxide emissions from second home mobility, with a particular focus on reasons for choosing relevant modes of transportation to second home areas and while staying there. The questionnaire data show that the climate impacts are particularly high for trips to second homes located abroad, but due to their higher number, mobility when visiting domestic Norwegian second homes is also a sizeable source of CO2 emissions. Qualitative interviews with 18 participants illustrate important reasons why the car is often considered the default mode of travel when going to Norwegian second homes. These findings provide foundations for proposing land use and transport policies to reduce the climate impact of second home mobility.

AB  - The large biomass resource in the Norwegian woods may contribute considerably to the development of a more sustainable energy system. A more complete tree harvest is being promoted, where harvest residues are utilised to provide bioenergy. Little research has addressed the intentions of forest owners towards harvesting forest residues.
   A survey of non-industrial private forest owners in two municipalities located in the south east of Norway was conducted in order to understand their attitudes and intentions to provide harvest residues for bioenergy production. The results showed that forest owners would be willing to supply harvest residues: about 40% of the respondents were highly in favour and almost 70% expressed a positive opinion.
   A factor analysis of the attitudinal statements resulted in four main factors of which three were found to significantly affect the intention in a regression analysis. The first factor was related to the beneficial effects of harvest residues, the second covered negative (mainly environmental) effects, and the third covered the positive effects upon forest management.
   The social influences seemed to have two distinct dimensions: personal relationships (e.g., other forest owners, neighbours and family) and professional interactions (e.g., governmental authorities). While the former had a significant effect on intentions, the latter did not. Finally, socioeconomic variables (gender, age, and municipality) did not influence the intention to deliver harvest residues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - National and provincial policy changes during the 1820s usurped the land and resource use rights of the Jokkmokk Saami to protect the rapidly growing settler population in northern Sweden. Ethnohistorical sources suggest that changes took place in Saami socioeconomic structures as a result of that loss of access to resources. Under pressure from the Swedish authorities, traditional communal groups such as the siida (the cooperative hunting/herding village) were replaced by independent households, which competed with each other for resources. While some families became wealthy, other households lost their herds and dropped out of the nomadic society, continuing the process begun with the initial shift to pastoralism two centuries before. Historical demographic data reveal a decrease in the number of Saami households and total population at both the parish and village levels after 1830. Conversely, family size grew slightly, reflecting the need for independent and competing households to provide their own sources of labor.

AB  - Foreign drivers are considered to be a greater risk than domestic drivers in most countries in the world. Few empirical findings have been reported, though. This paper contributes some evidence of the risk of foreign drivers in south-eastern Finland during 1992-1995. Most of the foreign drivers are Russian. Based on accident statistics collected by the police and origin-destination studies carried out on the Finnish-Russian border stations. accident rates were calculated for both Finnish and foreign drivers. The results show that accident rates of foreign drivers are higher than rates of domestic drivers. The winter season is especially risky for foreign drivers. It is argued that the traffic culture of different countries largely explain the differences rather than some specific, technical risk parameters. Some probable risk parameters can be identified in this study, such as a lack of knowledge concerning traffic rules, insufficient winter-time driving skills and winter-time equipment, as well as the general attitude towards traffic safety which is reflected in the driving behavior.

AB  - Spatial planning has been earmarked as an important tool for achieving sustainable development. In Sweden the important task of planning for sustainable spatial development and land use falls largely to the local authorities, since there is no official institute for spatial planning at a national or regional level. This article investigates local planning for sustainable development by analysing recent municipal comprehensive plans, which it is argued are a major instrument for this purpose. Although comprehensive plans are statutory, their design and content is very much at local discretion, and for the most part, not a rigid process governed from above. For this reason, a template analysis was used, where the template was built from the contents of the comprehensive plans, and not from a predefined understanding of what sustainability is or how planning for sustainable development should be done. What the findings reveal, however, is that there is not much deliberation concerning the meaning(s) of sustainable development, and, further, that the planning principles considered necessary to bring about sustainable development were not exclusively regarded as sustainable as such, but rather as part of a general 'belief system' about prudent planning-sustainable or not. It is suggested that, rather than rethinking planning, planners have internalized the concept of sustainable planning into the existing 'belief system,' and thus, the planning principles have become 'sustainable' by default.

AB  - Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity will play an important role in deep decarbonisation of industry. However, adding large electrolyser capacities to a low-carbon electricity system also increases the need for additional electricity generation from variable renewable energies. This will require hydrogen production to be variable unless other sources provide sufficient flexibility. Existing sources of flexibility in hydro-thermal systems are hydropower and thermal generation, which are both associated with sustainability concerns. In this work, we use a dispatch model for the case of Sweden to assess the power system operation with large-scale electrolysers, assuming that additional wind power generation matches the electricity demand of hydrogen production on average. We evaluate different scenarios for restricting the flexibility of hydropower and thermal generation and include 29 different weather years to test the impact of variable weather regimes. We show that (a) in all scenarios electrolyser utilisation is above 60% on average, (b) the inter-annual variability of hydrogen production is substantial if thermal power is not dispatched for electrolysis, and (c) this problem is aggravated if hydropower flexibility is also restricted. Therefore, either long-term storage of hydrogen or backup hydrogen sources may be necessary to guarantee continuous hydrogen flows. Large-scale dispatch of electrolysis capacity supported by wind power makes the system more stable, if electrolysers ramp down in rare hours of extreme events with low renewable generation. The need for additional backup capacities in a fully renewable electricity system will thus be reduced if wind power and electrolyser operation are combined in the system.

AB  - Spatial variation in wintering bird communities in different types of urban residential areas is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to find out which bird species from the regional species pool are able to inhabit residential areas, whether bird communities in different types of residential area differ from one another, and what are the factors affecting birds. We conducted our study in five apartment-building areas, five family-house areas, and five villages in northern Finland by using the single-visit study plot method during five winters, i.e. 1998/1999-2003/2004. Old-growth-forest-specialist species, in particular, avoided residential areas, whereas the other species appeared to benefit from residential development. The species richness, the total number of individuals, and the abundance of most of the species were higher in the family-house areas and in villages than in apartment-building areas. The proportion of individuals belonging to resident species was higher in the apartment-building areas than in the other habitats, whereas the proportion of individuals belonging to feeding-table species was higher in the villages than in the other habitats. The species richness and the total number of individuals increased with the increasing number of feeding tables and decreased with increasingly larger proportions of apartment buildings within the study plot. Parus montanus, P. major, P. caeruleus, Passer domesticus, and Carduelis flammea benefitted from feeding tables. Our study demonstrated that carefully planned winter feeding programmes can enhance the wintering possibilities for birds, and thus promote the biodiversity in urban ecosystems at northern latitudes.

AB  - The study of a herd marks the point where ethnography and ethology meet. In the midst of this shared phenomenon, versions of 'the social' hinge on relations between herders and herd. In this paper I consider how our understanding of a herd might be extended by an awareness of its diverse geographies. This is achieved by reconstructing the entwined biographies of human and animal subjects dating from the reintroduction of reindeer to Scotland in 1952. The first transportation of reindeer from Scandinavia to the Cairngorm mountains was orchestrated by Mikel Utsi, a Lappish emigre from northernmost Sweden, and Ethel John Lindgren, a social anthropologist from Cambridge, of American-Swedish descent. What began as an ecological-economic experiment would occupy the couple until their deaths: Utsi's in 1979 and Lindgren's in 1988. I draw on a 'make-do' methodology undertaken in collaboration with past herders and the scattered company of the present herd: walking a sentient topography of traditional grazing grounds; renewing encounters with charismatic animals through photographic portraits; consulting an archive of herding diaries; and mapping a hidden ecology of landscape relics. These different registers of memory are used to explore how day-to-day engagements between herders and herd were rooted in unconventional systems of ecological and cultural knowledge. By reanimating a local landscape, the resulting narrative works at an intimate scale, while simultaneously gathering momentum from transnational movements of humans, animals, and traditions. Here, salvage and exchange are possible between geography's heritage of landscape and folk study and the sculpting of contemporary research.

AB  - Future climate conditions need to be considered in planning for urban areas. As well as considering how new structures would best endure in the future, it is important to take into account factors that contribute to the degradation of cultural heritage buildings in the urban setting. Climate change can cause an increase in structural degradation. In this paper, a review of both what these factors are and how they are addressed by urban planners is presented. A series of inquiries into the topic was carried out on town planning personnel and those involved in cultural heritage preservation in several towns and cities in Finland and in a small number of other European countries. The target group members were asked about observed climate change impacts on cultural heritage, about present steps being taken to protect urban cultural heritage, and also their views were obtained on how climate change impacts will be emphasised in the future in this regard. The results of the inquiry demonstrate that climate change is still considered only in a limited way in urban planning, and more interaction between different bodies, both planning and heritage authorities, as well as current research on climate change impacts, is needed in the field.

AB  - pH trends from the last deglaciation to present day are assessed for acid clear-water lakes in South Sweden in relation to natural development, land use, and acid deposition. A general model for pH development is presented, based on diatom analysis of sediment cores from about 20 lakes, providing, in part, a new view of acidification history. Four periods are identified: (I) the natural long-term acidification period (12000 B.P.-2300 B.P. or later), with gradually decreasing pH values from about 7 to 5.5 resulting from soil acidification and declining fluxes of base cations from catchment soils; (II) the anthropogenic alkalization period (2300B.P.-1900A.D.), when pH increased to above 6 due to land use; (III) the recent acidification period (about 1900 A.D.-present), when pH decreased to about 4.5 due to acid deposition and possibly altered land use; and (IV) the liming period (1970s - present), when pH often increases to values above 7 following liming to counteract acidification. The implications of past pH changes are discussed in the context of contemporary lake acidification and liming policy.

AB  - Finland's Natura network is now virtually complete. The EU has approved the Alpine zone in the very north of the country, and a decision on the boreal zone is expected later this year (article on pages 138-139).
   Finland began work on its network of Natura sites in 1995, immediately after the country joined the EU. "We have a long tradition in nature conservation, and the Natura programme is basically a cross-section of what was already in place", says Heikki Korpelainen of the Ministry of the Environment. "The exemplary way in which Finland has established its Natura network also shows that we have acted to promote the interests of sustainable forestry", he continues. Finland's Natura sites cover a total area of almost five million hectares.

AB  - We studied the effects of habitat fragmentation, measured as forest stand size and isolation, on the distribution of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). Squirrel density was surveyed during four years in 46 forest stands (0.1-500 ha) in a forest landscape in south-central Sweden. The only factor that significantly influenced a density index was the proportion of spruce within a habitat fragment. Neither fragment size nor degree of isolation were significant. Furthermore, none of the interactions with year were significant, suggesting the same pattern in all four years. Thus, the effect of habitat fragmentation in this study seems to be only pure habitat loss, i.e. halving the proportion of preferred habitat in the landscape should result in a halving of the red squirrel population. Therefore, the landscape can be viewed as functionally continuous for the squirrels, although the preferred habitat was divided into fragments. The most likely explanation for the difference between this study and other studies on squirrels that found effects due to habitat fragmentation is a combination of shorter distances and less hostile surroundings in our study area. To identify landscape effects requires multiple studies because single studies usually consider only one landscape.

AB  - A core challenge in environmental planning is the gap between a strong participatory ethos and top-down defined nature protection policies. Nature protection policies for large areas are concerned with securing ecological biodiversity and wildlife habitats against increasing societal claims. Such planning objectives also affect the socio-economic and cultural relations between the local community and the area they live in, and raise conflicts between local and national protection objectives and steering levels. Despite attempts to facilitate participatory planning approaches as a means of reducing conflict, nature protection continues to be contested in local communities. This paper explores the different understandings of nature at play between citizens and planning authorities throughout a habitat protection planning process in Norway. The paper discusses whether environmental planning of large spatial areas could develop communication arenas designed to deliberate different understandings of an area as a matter of commons between institutional planning perspectives of nature protection and ( local) understandings of the area as part of everyday life. The paper sheds light on how large spatial areas are understood at different government levels and from everyday life orientations, and how these could be used to develop mutual understandings of the area as a common.

AB  - An examination of how land-use planning can proceed while emphasising sustainability in transport objectives is presented in the authors' view. It is vital that citizen preferences are assessed, and the 'area development negotiation' method for obtaining such preferences is detailed within a case study framework. The method permits evaluations by various stakeholder groups of future urban mobility scenarios by means of multiattribute utility analyses. In order to illustrate the method, key results from a Swedish case study are presented, demonstrating that all interest groups-with the exception of business representatives-were aware of the importance of environmental factors and gave these factors greater weight than economic factors. Discussion focuses upon issues relevant to policy analysis, strategic planning including stakeholders, and upon issues relevant to the policy process, such as how the method can support and meaningfully engage the citizen in strategic planning.

AB  - The topic investigated is the social-ecological system of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) fishing and aquaculture as a tourism product in an era of climate change. Arctic charr is a resilient salmonid species that was traditionally an important part of the sustenance economy in Arctic and Subarctic communities as a source of fresh food throughout the year. Arctic charr populations have declined in recent years, in part due to climate change. These changes in the freshwater ecosystems in turn affect the cultural and economic traditions of freshwater fishing and consumption. This development has consequences for the tourism industry as hunting, fishing and consuming local and traditional food is important in branding tourism destinations. Fisheries are no longer the source of this important ingredient in the Nordic culinary tradition, instead aquaculture production supplies nearly all the Arctic charr consumed. In this paper, we pool the resources of an interdisciplinary team of scholars researching climate change, freshwater ecology, aquaculture and tourism. We integrate knowledge from these fields to discuss likely future scenarios for Arctic charr, their implications for transdisciplinary social ecosystem approaches to sustainable production, marketing and management, particularly how this relates to the growing industry of tourism in the Nordic Arctic and Subarctic region. We pose the questions whether Arctic Charr will be on the menu in 20 years and if so, where will it come from, and what consequences does that have for local food in tourism of the region? Our discussion starts with climate change and the question of how warm it is likely to get in the Nordic Arctic, particularly focusing on Iceland and Norway. To address the implications of the warming of lakes and rivers of the global north for Arctic charr we move on to a discussion of physiological and ecological factors that are important for the distribution of the species. We present the state of the art of Arctic charr aquaculture before articulating the importance of the species for marketing of local and regional food, particularly in the tourism market. Finally, we discuss the need for further elaboration of future scenarios for the interaction of the Arctic charr ecosystem and the economic trade in the species and draw conclusions about sustainable future development.

AB  - Local strategies and policies are key in climate adaptation, although research shows significant barriers to progress. Sweden, often seen as progressive in climate change issues, has struggled in adopting a sufficient local climate adaptation organization. This article aimed to describe and analyze the climate adaptation organization in 13 Swedish municipalities from five perspectives: Problem framing, administrative and political agency, administrative and political structures, measures and solutions, and the role of learning. The mapping of these perspectives provides an opportunity to analyze barriers to local climate adaptation. Key policy documents have been studied including climate adaptation plans, crisis management plans, and regulatory documents, as well as documents from private consultants. This study showed that few municipalities have a formal organization for climate adaptation, clear structures, political support, and specific climate adaptation plans. At the same time, many of the municipalities are planning for transformation, due to a push from the county board, a lead agency in climate adaptation. There are also ample networks providing opportunities for learning among municipalities and regions. This study concluded that one key barrier is the lack of focus and prioritization in a majority of the municipalities, leaving the administrators, often planners, in a more activist position. The need for organizational mainstreaming and resources is emphasized.

AB  - Sweden has a housing shortage, which the Swedish authorities expect to continue until 2025. Producers of wooden multi-family buildings have a relatively small market share in comparison to traditional building materials. The limited capacity to fulfil the increased building demand also restricts the possibilities for development towards innovation, bio-economy and sustainability. The municipalities in Sweden have responsibility for the planning of the building development in their region based on their projected requirements and strategies. Combining this with a desire to develop sustainable building solutions based on wood increases the complexity. Currently, public building developments are achieved through the public procurement act or the land allocation activity, dependent on their development strategy. This normally involves the development of local strategies regarding, for example, design, material choice and geographical development. This study aims to identify drivers that will enable improved market activities related to actions in public building initiatives using wood-based solutions, which is conducted by studying a specific building project managed by the Vaxjo Municipality in Sweden. The result indicates that improved transparency in the land allocation activity generates possibilities for developers to respond successfully to the requests submitted by the municipalities, and thus, increase the possible use of sustainable building methods using wood. This knowledge improves the understanding of the required strategic development for the companies, the government and the municipalities, to increase the use of sustainable building materials in Swedish multi-family housing projects.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx occupies a variety of environmental and climatic conditions, and the majority of present-day European populations have either recovered from severe demographic bottlenecks, or are living in fragmented habitat. These factors may have affected the genetic variability of lynx populations. We summarize available data on genetics, population status and ecology of these felids to shed light on the pattern and mechanisms behind their genetic variability and population differentiation in Europe.
   Genetic studies conducted so far, based on mtDNA and microsatellites, have shown that the Eurasian lynx has low to moderate genetic variability. Variability is lowest in the north (Scandinavian bottlenecked population), but is also low in the Carpathian region. A trend towards loss of genetic variation has been noted in fragmented and reintroduced populations. Genetically, the populations are highly differentiated from each other.
   There are clear relationships between the pattern of lynx genetic variability, differentiation between the populations, and such factors as population history (demographic bottlenecks), social interactions and habitat fragmentation. The genetic divergence between lynx populations is also strongly correlated with the depth and duration of snow cover.
   Our review provides evidence that the lynx is undergoing significant genetic differentiation, due to several factors. To enable better planning of conservation programmes for the Eurasian lynx, researchers should identify the Evolutionarily Significant Units among its populations, using different classes of molecular markers.

AB  - Based on a survey of civil servants in the Norwegian central government, this article describes perceptions of coordination capacity and examines to what degree the variations in perceived coordinating capacity can be explained by structural and cultural features. In particular, it focuses on the significance of wicked policy areas. Overall the coordination capacity is weaker in wicked policy areas than in other policy areas. Controlling for other features the coordination capacity is primarily related to cultural factors, such as mutual trust, level of conflict, and identification with the central government. Some structural features, such as administrative level, also have an effect.

AB  - Three polar bear populations (Ursus maritimus) occur in the Russian Arctic: Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya, Laptevskaya, and Chukchi-Alaska. The status and local condition of each population differs and requires different conservation and management approaches. The Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya population in the early 1980s had approximately 3,000-6,700 animals. About 1,700-2,000 bears of this population inhabit the Svalbard, Norway, region and are considered by Norwegian specialists as a separate sub-population. No survey data are available to detect changes in population size, although Barents Sea resources were over-harvested during the 1980s. Because of these uncertainties, it has been recommended that this population be placed in the fourth category (undetermined status) in the Red Data Book of Animals of the Russian Federation (Eliseev 1983) when the next issue is published. This status allows use of the population for recreational viewing purposes and for capturing cubs for zoological gardens. The Frans-Josef Land Archipelago has been designated a federal refuge, which protects the polar bear population in the region. Additional protected territories and marine areas in the Novaya Zemlya region are planned and would provide additional protection for the Spitsbergen-Novozemelskaya polar bear population. The Laptevskaya population of approximately 1,000 bears has been stable for decades. The comparatively small size and low density of this population justifies retaining it in the third category (rare status) of the Red Data Book of Animals of the Russian Federation (Eliseev 1983), which provides greater protection than other designations. In the denning areas of this population, the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago and the Novosibirsk Islands, establishing natural protection territories has been recommended. Only recreational use (viewing) of this population is allowed. The Chukchi-Alaskan population numbers several thousand bears and is harvested only by Alaskan native people. A proposal is pending to move this population to the fifth category (restored or rehabilitated status) of the Red Data Book of Animals of the Russian Federation (Eliseev 1983). In Russia, hunting polar bears in this population for subsistence purposes by indigenous peoples is being considered. However, experts propose that legalized hunting be contingent upon elimination of the current illegal hunting that occurs in this region in Russia. For more effective protection of polar bears, it has been recommended that marine areas in the East-Siberian and Chukchi seas be added to the Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve and that an international protected marine area be established in the southern Chukchi Sea.

AB  - As transport automation technology continues to emerge, there is a need to engage in the questions of its governing-to find a balance between unreflective enablement and rigid control. An increasing body of literature has begun to address the topic, but only a few studies have examined discourse and culture as central components of the related governance processes. This article aims to analyse the discourse surrounding self-driving vehicles in the Finnish context by drawing from the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. The critical discourse analysis framework is applied to study a comprehensive set of documents published by Finnish national-level governmental bodies from 2013 to 2020. The analysis identifies four imagined ways of implementing self-driving vehicles into the Finnish transport system and a large set of mostly positive anticipated implications. Moreover, the analysis illustrates the transport automation imaginary's cultural and spatial detachment, most obvious in the lack of detail and the disconnection between the imagined implementations and the anticipated implications. The findings are convergent with findings from other governance contexts, where discourse has been largely characterised by an unjustified optimism and strong determinism related to the wedlock with the automobility regime. If left unaddressed, such lack of reflectivity will not just lead to a plethora of undesired implications for Finnish society at large but will also signify a failure in developing an adaptive governance culture needed to face challenges of the 21st century.

AB  - Sweden's mountain areas are sensitive ecosystems that are used by a wide range of stakeholders, and this raises multiple sustainability concerns. Collaborative governance solutions are becoming increasingly common in such situations to promote more sustainable practices. While the Swedish mountain area is indeed a hot spot for different forms of public-private partnerships (PPPs) related to natural resources management, as yet, little is known about the shaping of participation, leadership, and implementation of these processes. What are the drivers for implementing collaborative environmental partnerships, do the drivers differ, and if so, how? What role does the specific context play in the design of these PPPs? Are the PPPs useful, and if so, for what? To analyze those issues, we conducted 38 semi-structured interviews with project leaders from a sample randomly selected from a database of 245 public-private collaborative projects in the Swedish mountains. Our results indicate that consequential incentives in the form of funding and previous successful collaborations seem to be the major drivers for such partnerships. A critical discussion of the possibilities and limitations of public-private forms of governance in rural mountain areas adds to the ongoing debate on the performance of environmental PPPs in a regional context.

AB  - To study whether, why, and how forestry decision-makers in Southeastern Norway adapt to climate change, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews in focus groups consisting of non-industrial private forest owners, forest managers, and forest advisors. Our results show that a majority of the participants believed in climate change as a phenomenon, and had experienced events or observed changes that they attributed to climate change. However, we found little evidence of concern regarding climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and forestry among the participants. Instead, the majority regarded climate change more as an opportunity for the Norwegian forest-based sector than a threat. A minority had implemented proactive practices motivated by climate change but in all but one case, the adjustments were adaptation of forest infrastructure. In general, the participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with the effects of climate change and the (economical) uncertainty associated with adaptation of forest ecosystems were too large to change forest management practices at present. However, many participants, in particular the managers, are already adapting in response to experienced problems, such as increased frequency and duration of periods with low carrying capacity of the ground implying reduced or no accessibility within and to stands.

AB  - Conserving soil carbon is one of many actions to take in limiting global warming. However, carbon dense peatlands are still being drained or excavated. Infrastructure development is one of the major current threats to boral peatlands in Fennoscandia, but few tools are available for calculations of carbon stocks in peatland areas, necessary for decision makers planning development projects. Thus, we compiled a reference database of key peat characteristics from main boreal peatland types sampled in Norway and tested "best practice" peat depth sampling methods and peat volume interpolations. We implemented our findings in CarbonViewer, a tool and easy-to-use app that reliably calculates carbon stocks of delimited peatlands. Tool and method presented, estimates carbon stocks to assess potential soil carbon loss in planned infrastructure development on peatlands and will give decision makers the necessary knowledge base to limit emissions from soil carbon.

AB  - Populations along the northern boundary of a marine species' distributional range in the NE Atlantic are expected to harbor lower standing genetic variation as a consequence of post-glacial expansion following the last glacial maximum. Founder events and marginal habitat availability may render the edge populations more vulnerable to anthropogenic stress and less cap able of rapid adaptation to global climate change, a concern for conservation and management. We analyzed meadow architecture, persistence and connectivity within and among 15 locations (600 samples genotyped with 8 microsatellite loci) in 3 fjords in Troms County, Norway (69 degrees N). Whereas global mean allelic diversity (standardized for sample size) was in accordance with previous studies using the same markers, more extensive sampling revealed a broader range of allelic richness (mean = 2.85; range = 1.84 to 4.21) in the regional pool. Genotypic diversity was typically high, whereas large genets were rare (2 out of 15 locations). Population differentiation (F-ST) was 2 to 6 times higher between fjords than within fjords. A Bayesian (STRUCTURE) analysis also strongly supported the genetic distinctness of each fjord. Although 9 locations within the 60 km long Balsfjord were connected by gene flow, demographic connectivity may actually be low, as fixed differences were observed at 6 of the 9 locations, along with significantly positive inbreeding coefficients and strong substructure. Overall, our results suggest that these northern, leading-edge meadows are healthy, but vigilance is required to avoid further losses. Fjord-level management, especially of the larger fjords, will be sufficient to capture the range of variation.

AB  - Policy makers often find their leeway restricted when it comes to shaping sustainable urban planning practice. Within each professional sector, there are limited opportunities for creative exploration in the cross-fire between minimum state regulations and relentless pressure from private developers. In face of the environmental challenges society is up against, a more extensive focus on the potential repertoire of design methods, solutions and experiences is needed.
   Broset is a 35 hectare site located 4 kilometers outside the center of Trondheim. Despite this moderate distance to the center, the area's character is of suburban nature. Broset has been chosen as a location for a new neighborhood that combines low energy demand with a socially sustainable living environment [1]. Sustainability is defined in a holistic way, including low energy demand and healthy materials, as well as social and economic issues. According to existing regulations approximately 1050-1750 housing can be constructed at Broset. Designing a settlement that enables people to lower their carbon-footprint is not only a matter of technology, material and energy use, but also includes lifestyle, housing patterns, and transport.
   The development of the Broset area also forms a major component of the participation of Trondheim city in the Norwegian Cities of the Future project, a strategic government-run program with focus on land use and transportation, energy use in buildings, consumption and waste, and climate change [2].
   This paper describes experiences from the capacity building activities developed around the Broset project initiated in 2007 in Trondheim as a framework for new knowledge and new recognition regarding sustainable resource use in local architecture and planning.

AB  - The concept of critical load is now widely used in the management of acidified waters. In southern Norway, acidification due to long-range transported air pollutants is one of the most serious environmental problems, affecting an area of 80,000 km(2). To preserve and restore biodiversity, Norwegian authorities have chosen liming as a temporary mitigation measure. Critical load estimates were used to estimate the material and financial needs for this large-scale program. In 1995, more than 2000 localities ranging from small lakes to large salmon rivers were limed. Liming costs in 1996 were $18 million (U.S.). Critical load estimates also formed the basis for international negotiations on sulfur emission reductions, resulting in the second sulfur protocol for Europe and North America in 1994. The critical load estimates indicated that acidified areas in Norway would be reduced to 35,000 km(2) after the year 2010, after the commitments of the sulfur protocols are met. By that time, estimated liming costs would be reduced by almost 40%. Lime treatment of River Tovdalselva, with a catchment area of 1885 km(2), is probably the largest integrated liming project in the world. In 1990 the critical load was exceeded in 98% of the Tovdalselva catchment. After the year 2010 the exceeded area may be reduced to 44% and the liming cost by two-thirds.

AB  - This research delineates the perceptions of tourism in the Arctic. It deploys a qualitative study to disentangle the complicity of perceived impacts amongst three types of tourism stakeholders: (1) residents, (2) tourists, and (3) tourism professionals working in hotels, tour operations, restaurants, tourist information centers, and tourism planning agencies within the study region. This study transpires in Finnmark, which is one of the most visited Arctic destinations. Sixty-eight personal interviews are conducted in six towns and cruise ships sailing through the study region. Consequently, the study presents six thematic views entailing (1) monetary contribution, (2) cultural proliferation, (3) community vitality, (4) personal enhancement, (5) environmental degradation, and (6) social disturbance surface as the perceived impacts of tourism among the stakeholders. Unlike most impact studies in the existing literature, this research shows that monetary contribution is not necessarily the key perceived benefit of tourism. Instead, social factors, such as achieving a vibrant community life, could also be a valuable contribution of tourism in the case of this region in northern Norway. Lastly, discussions from theoretical and practice perspectives are rendered along with suggestions for future research.

AB  - Building the adaptive capacity of interlinked social and ecological systems is assumed to improve implementation of sustainable forest management (SFM) policies. One mechanism is collaborative learning by continuous evaluation, communication, and transdisciplinary knowledge production. The Model Forest (MF) concept, developed in Canada, is intended to encourage all dimensions of sustainable development through collaboration among stakeholders of forest resources in a geographical area. Because the MF approach encompasses both social and ecological systems, it can be seen as a process aimed at improving adaptive capacity to deal with uncertainty and change. We analyzed multi-stakeholder approaches used in four MF initiatives representing social-ecological systems with different governance legacies and economic histories in the northwest of the Russian Federation (Komi MF and Pskov MF) and in Sweden (Vilhelmina MF and the Foundation Safsen Forests in the Bergslagen region). To describe the motivations behind development of the initiative and the governance systems, we used qualitative open-ended interviews and analyzed reports and official documents. The initial driving forces for establishing new local governance arrangements were different in all four cases. All MFs were characterized by multilevel and multi-sector collaboration. However, the distribution of power among stakeholders ranged from clearly top down in the Russian Federation to largely bottom up in Sweden. All MF initiatives shared three main challenges: (a) to develop governance arrangements that include representative actors and stakeholders, (b) to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to governance, and (c) to coordinate different sectors' modes of landscape governance. We conclude that, in principle, the MF concept is a promising approach to multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, to understand the local and regional dimensions of sustainability, and the level of adaptability of such multi-stakeholder collaboration initiatives, empirical studies of outcomes are needed. To assess the adaptive capacity, the states and trends of economic, ecological, social, and cultural dimensions in actual landscapes need to be linked to how the multistakeholder collaboration develops and performs over the long term.

AB  - Up until recent years, all agricultural production in Norway was strictly regulated through spatial policy (location), production quotas and other price and market regulations. Prices and products were handled by the farmers' cooperatives. International (e.g. WTO agreements) and domestic pressure has gradually loosened the governmental regulation of chicken and eggs. Economic (e.g. new ownerships), technological (innovations throughout the whole chain), political and institutional (liberalization) and cultural (e.g. in consumption and farming) changes have reconfigured the landscapes of chicken meat production, opening up new opportunities for the chicken industry. Chicken therefore makes a particularly good case for exploring recent major changes in the agri-food system. In this chapter, we investigate evolving rules, risks, challenges and opportunities in and around chicken meat value chains. Empirically. ire build on interviews, document studies and statistics on the structural development of the chicken industry and we discuss how these changes are developing in other parts of the Norwegian agri-food system.

AB  - Patterns of 10-year variation (1993-2002) in a bird species community were studied in a managed southern boreal forest in Finland using yearly repeated bird censuses. Specifically, effects of logging on cavity-nesting bird species of coniferous and mixed woods were examined. Logging was based on the recommendations of new forestry practices, which have been designed to maintain biodiversity in Finnish forests. Repeated measures ANOVA with polynomial contrasts was adopted when studying temporal variation of bird abundance. Short-distance and partial migrants showed significant year-to-year variation, whereas the temporal variation in resident birds and long-distance migrants did not vary significantly. Numbers of short-distance migrants declined during the study period, whereas partial migrants had significant non-linear (third-order) variation between years. The temporal variation of partial migrants was largely due to variation in spruce seed eaters, the siskin Carduelis spinus and the crossbill Loxia curvirostra, the numbers of which varied according to the spruce cone crop. New logging practices had a negative effect on the numbers of cavity-nesters of coniferous and mixed woods. However, winter temperatures correlated positively with the numbers of resident cavity-nesting tit guild species (Parus montanus, P. cristatus, P. ater, Certhia familiaris), so that mild winters may ameliorate the adverse effects of forestry practices on resident forest species.

AB  - Recreational fisheries hold immense ecological, social, and economic value. The management of these fisheries is increasingly important as we move forward in the Anthropocene. Recreational fisheries managers face several challenges as fisheries often involve diverse social and ecological systems comprised of complex feedback and stakeholder motivations and needs. Here, we used a horizon scanning exercise to yield 100 research questions related to recreational fisheries science and management in the Anthropocene. Initial research questions (n = 205) were collected from recreational fisheries experts (i.e., stakeholders, managers, researchers) from various sectors (i.e., industry, government, NGOs) and geographic locations (14 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA). These questions were subsequently categorized, thematized, and refined by our authorship team, eventually yielding what we considered to be the top 100 research questions of relevance to management of recreational fisheries. The key themes include: human dimensions; bioeconomics; resource monitoring and data acquisition; governance; management-regulatory actions; management-stock and habitat enhancement; catch-and-release; impacts of recreational fisheries on populations, communities and ecosystems; threats and sustainability; and angler outreach, education and engagement. It is our intention that this comprehensive and forward-looking list will create a framework to guide future research within this field, and contribute to evidence-based recreational fisheries management and policy.

AB  - Forests long subjected to management for timber production contain only a fraction of the volumes of coarse woody debris (CWD) found in pristine forests. This is a threat to many organisms that depend on CWD. Forest management practices have been altered to achieve an increase in the amounts of CWD. Few studies have attempted to analyze the occurrence of CWD at the landscape level. We studied the occurrence of CWD in stands of different ages and management background in a boreal forest landscape in central Sweden. Volume of CWD in unmanaged stands (nature reserves and set-asides) was twice that in managed stands. The composition of CWD was influenced by stand age and management regime. Standing CWD was more common in unmanaged stands than in managed stands. Pine CWD was particularly prevalent in young forest stands (859 years of age). Bark-covered CWD was most common on deciduous and spruce wood and uncommon on pine. Bark area in young forest stands was almost 10 times lower than that in other managed stands. Using the age distribution of stands, we estimated the volume and bark area of CWD in the landscape. Recent clear-cuts harvested in accordance with new management guidelines contained more early decay CWD per ha than old managed stands. Young forests covered over half the landscape and had significantly lower volumes of spruce and deciduous CWD compared with other stands. The consequences of these results for biodiversity-oriented forest management are discussed.(c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the context of enhancing sustainable and livable urban environments, one aim is to establish multifunctional green infrastructure (GI). We argue that in order to successfully plan and manage the development of GI, an inclusive and future-oriented stance concerning the needs and expectations of urbanites is required. By using green roofs as an example, the aim of this paper was to offer insights into how people envisage novel GI in urban environments and to reveal the scope of meanings and values people attach to these kinds of green infrastructure. We present results based on 149 stories collected with the method of empathy-based stories. Respondents were asked to use their imagination to produce mental images of not-yet-existing green roofs in different urban situations. Our results reflect a rich set of dimensions of green roofs that the respondents vividly imagined. Green roofs may contribute to the livability of urban areas in multiple ways, such as strengthening social cohesion, providing space for everyday renewal and restoration, offering interesting sceneries and multisensory experiences, softening the hard cityscape, showing ephemeral events and making experiences of "height" possible, as well as increasing the "contact with nature" experiences for residents, e.g. through biodiverse nature in the middle of built environments. Furthermore, the need for local, customized solutions that offer different benefits and experiences was expressed. Using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we idealized four green roof meta-types for understanding the diverse expectations people may have for green roofs in urban area: Urban farm, Oasis, Urban hill and Meadow. Based on our results we suggest that comprehensive experiences and needs of people should be taken into account when designing urban green roofs or urban green in general not only, e.g. visual pleasure. Also, site- and user-specific solutions should be considered instead of generally applied ones. Our results offer tools for, e.g. urban planners to understand the value of diverse green roof solutions to the user. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Buffer strips have recently become the main management practice for reducing logging impact on stream habitats in boreal and temperate regions. The habitat value of buffer strips, however, has not received much attention, although riparian forests belong to the systems with the highest biodiversity in these regions. We used plants as indicators of the ability of buffer strips to maintain an environment similar to intact riparian forests in a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. We measured the growth of three common bryophyte species (Hylocomiastrum umbratum, Calypogeia integristipula, and Tritomaria quinquedentata) transplanted to riparian habitat close to a stream in clear-cut logged sites 10-15 m wide buffer strips on each side of the stream, and intact (reference) sites. Each of the three site categories included six wet and six tnoist-mesic sites and the experiment was followed over three months in 1999.
   The species remained vital in the reference sites and grew substantially during the 3-mo-long experiment, but in the logged sites almost no growth was registered, and many shoots died (except for T. qninquedentata). The pattern was consistent irrespective of the ground moisture class. The performance of bryophytes in the moist-mesic buffer strips was almost as bad as in the logged sites, whereas in the wet buffer strips it was either intermediate between that in logged and reference sites (H. umbratum) or very similar to that in reference sites (C. integristipula and T. quinquedentata). The edge effect has previously been shown to vary depending on edge orientation, edge physiognomy, and weather conditions. We found that ground moisture can be of major importance as well. Although many buffer strips function better than no strips, 20-30 m wide strips (with a stream in the middle) through a logged area consist entirely of edge habitat. Increasing the buffer width and avoiding clear-cut logging on both sides of a watercourse would be the first steps to take for improving biodiversity conservation in riparian habitats. Our results also show that bryophytes are good indicators of habitat quality and efficient tools for assessing the ecological function of buffer strips.

AB  - The consequences of reallocating fishing effort from trawling to creels in an area off the West coast of Portugal for the operation of the trawl fleet, as well as on the population dynamics and the global catch value for a high valued species, the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) are evaluated. The results suggest that only small portions of the area of interest are used by the trawl fleet, opening the possibility for a trawl ban without major disruption of the trawling activity. Economic benefits are expected, since predictions two scenarios tested, heavy and moderate exploitation, indicate no loss of catch value with much lower operational costs. Social benefits to local communities can also be expected since a much lower investment is needed for creel fishing, making this fishery attractive to small local companies already operating in the region. The proposed ban is consistent with the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) where the transition towards more responsible fishing practices is encouraged.

AB  - Purpose Departing from a study of a heritage-led economic development project of a Swedish historic church, the purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss how professional roles within the heritage field are negotiated through a development-centered heritage discourse, focusing on the implications for religious heritage sites. Design/methodology/approach A synchronic discourse analysis was conducted on a number of documents originating from the case study project, as well as five semi-structured interviews with key actors from the heritage field and the Church of Sweden. Findings The findings of the paper show that professional heritage discourses and practice limit and prevent nonstate heritage actors to engage in heritage-led development schemes of historic churches. Additionally, the professional roles and skills of nonheritage actors are perceived as ambiguous within the current governance system. Practical implications Examining emerging forms of management of religious heritage sites can provide inspiration and indicate possible conflicts that need to be addressed by heritage professionals in order to achieve successful management. Originality/value While studies of heritage-led economic development projects have previously focused on impact assessment and community engagement, this paper sheds light on how the discourses of these projects affect the conception of professional roles and practices.

AB  - This study presents a quantitative partitioning of the variance in floristic data from grazed semi-natural vegetation of summer farms in Roldal, western Norway. The data consist of 189 taxa recorded in 107 4-m(2) sample plots within 10 summer farms with different land-use histories. Thirty-five environmental variables were recorded, including altitude, slope, radiation, geology, soil chemistry, and past and present land-use. A series of (partial) canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) were used to partition the total variation into within-farm and between-farm components, and to investigate the explanatory power of different groups of environmental and land-use variables at the two scales. The results show that: (1) although local gradients are of overriding importance for floristic composition, landscape-scale processes also contribute significantly to the observed patterns; (2) the measured land-use and environmental factors account for comparable amounts of compositional variance at the two scales; and (3) even if the relative contributions of the two classes of explanatory variables are comparable, details differ, showing that broad-scale environmental and land-use patterns are not just scaled-up versions of the fine-scale patterns or vice versa. These results support a multi-process view of vegetation patterns.

AB  - Planning management activities for a long-term sustainable forestry requires predictive tools designed for this kind of management. Many tools available today are either designed for planning periods that are too short to consider long-term sustainability, omit important parts of the forest ecosystem or are not capable of considering environmental changes. A long-term potential growth-limiting factor is the supply of available base cations as was demonstrated in an earlier study for a research area in southern Sweden. This paper presents the ForSAFE model, a computer implemented model system where four robust and well evaluated stand-alone models are combined to a dynamic model that considers vegetation and soil as well as the links between them. The system dynamics approach with causal loop diagrams (CLD) and feedback loop analysis (FLA) is presented as a useful tool for conceptualizing and constructing ecosystem models.

AB  - This paper analyses urban waste systems to explore how local authorities can resolve challenges related to climate change, urbanization and resource depletion. The paper investigates how different public governance regimes affect local authorities' ability to move upwards in the waste hierarchy. It identifies three different governance regimes traditional bureaucracy, new public management and networked governance and uses the insights from innovation in urban waste in three Norwegian city regions Oslo, Drammen and Bergen to illuminate how these regimes possess both strengths and weaknesses in how they affect system optimization and system change. The observed working practices signal that the issue of urban waste systems is perceived as a challenge of system optimization rather than system change. Viewing this as a challenge requiring system change would probably have ensured a stronger directionality and a broader anchoring of actors. Such an approach is likely to have arrived at a waste prevention mode earlier than the step-by-step-solutions implemented so far. The paper concludes that there is not one best governance regime, but a need to acknowledge their coexistence and carefully consider the characteristics of the respective regimes in order to arrange urban waste systems for long-term dynamic and sustainable city regions.

AB  - Empirical relationships between catchment properties and nutrient losses are often derived from spatially restricted data, which hampers the ability to more widely generalize the results. In this study, we regressed the catchment characteristics and the losses of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for all monitored catchments in Finland with adequate data (n=59, from the year 2000 to 2011). TN loss was found to increase with the percentage of arable land and amount of point source loading and to decrease with increasing lake percentage. TP loss also increased not only with the percentage of arable land but also with fine-grained soils (Cambisols) in the catchment and decreased with the percentage of lakes. Urban areas, scattered settlements, and N deposition were not significant explanatory variables, possibly due to their spatial covariation with arable land in Finland. Despite the fact that only a few significant explanatory variables were identified, the models explained the TN and TP losses by up to 91% and 92%, respectively.

AB  - 1] Peatland drainage and peat extraction changes natural peatlands from a net carbon sink to that of a large net source due to increased respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide ( CO2) fixing vegetation. Restoration of these altered peatland ecosystems is being applied to reduce these carbon emissions. As peatland restoration is a new and emerging land-use management practice, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of restoration on the methane ( CH4) component of the carbon cycle at the Bois-des-Bel peatland located near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from early May to mid October for several years. The seasonal CH4 fluxes prior to restoration at an extracted ( cutover) and a restored peatland were not significantly different from each other or zero. However, three years postrestoration the seasonal CH4 emissions at the restored site were 4.2 g m(-2) CH4 season(-1), 4.6 times greater than the cutover site. Ponds and ditches at the restored site were seasonal CH4 emission hot spots ( 0.3 and 2.9 g m(-2) CH4 season(-1), respectively); however, emissions from herbaceous vegetation ( 1.0 g m(-2) CH4 season(-1)) were the dominant source of CH4 from the restored peatland due to its large areal extent. CH4 fluxes from the Bois-des-Bel peatland represented 14% of the total CO2-equivalent losses from the site. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation succession on peatland-atmosphere flux of CH4.

T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
LA  - English
CP  - International Conference of Marketing and Management Sciences
AB  - Public relations constitute one of the core tools of place marketing. The aim of this paper is to analyse a proposed Public Relations Plan (PRP) for the region of Kainuu, Finland. This plan is strategic and focuses on the effective communication with all the actors that are active in Kainuu, aiming also to contribute to its sustainable tourism development.
   The PRP is separated in two sub-PRPs. The first one is related to the internal environment of Kainuu focusing on the planning and implementation of particular actions that strengthen the active participation of the internal groups (enterprises, public organisations, citizens etc) in the promotion of the region's image and, consequently, in the region's tourism marketing. The second one has the same logic but is more complicated, since it is related to the external environment of Kainuu.
   The data are derived from the INTERREG IIIC project CultMark (Cultural Heritage, Local Identity and Place Marketing for Sustainable Development) that has been in operation in five European places (Nea Ionia, Magnesia-Greece - which was the lead partner - Chester-UK, Rostocic/TLM-Germany, Kainuu-Finland, Pafos-Cyprus) from the beginning of 2004 till the end of 2006.

AB  - . 1. Intensive forestry has drastically reduced the volume of standing deadwood, even more than total deadwood volume. It has been demonstrated in boreal forests that snags have a high conservation value for many saproxylic species and that the lying or standing aspect of the deadwood makes a difference. The conservation of saproxylic beetles in the changing deadwood landscape of temperate managed forests depends on a deeper understanding of the ecological value of forest stand legacies. 2. Our study questioned whether the retention of oak snags is an important conservation concern in European temperate forests. We analysed the differences in saproxylic beetle fauna between oak snags and logs and explored the diameter effect on logsnag differences. We compared the species composition and richness of saproxylic beetle assemblages in a temperate deciduous forest. Emergence traps were set in a balanced sampling design of 22 ground-lying logs and 22 oak snags with a range of intermediate decay stages and 2 diameter classes. 3. Oak snags yielded more individuals per volume unit and supported more species than logs, and exhibited significantly dissimilar assemblages from logs and hosted original species. Snags, especially large snags, were more interesting for rare beetle species conservation than logs. The feeding guild structure slightly differed between snags and logs. Overall, logsnag differences depended on the diameter class. 4. We confirm that saproxylic biodiversity would significantly benefit from forestry measures favouring oak snag retention (especially large snags), even though further multi-scale studies are necessary to develop quantitative retention guidelines.

AB  - An overall societal aim is to ensure a sustainable use and management of a country's land resources. This requires continuous delivery of reliable and up-to-date information to decision-makers. To be able to deliver this information the Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute (Skog og landskap) produces, among others, land resource statistics for all municipalities in Norway. The statistics are also produced on a county level and for the whole country. The acreage numbers are retrieved from a combination of different national datasets in various scales together with interpretation of satellite images. Through a reclassification, statistics are calculated for certain land resource classes like arable land, pasture, forest based on productivity class, fresh water, snow and glacier, mountainous/scarcely vegetated area and built up area. Skog og landskap has for the last couple of years been using open source software. The whole statistics production line is carried out by the means of such software. The results are stored in XML-files that are published on the internet. The production requires processing of several databases with national coverage, and needs to handle geometric operations efficiently and without error. The open software solution is reliable, stable and fast.

AB  - Sheep grazing is an important part of agriculture in the North Atlantic region, defined here as the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Scotland. This process has played a key role in shaping the landscape and biodiversity of the region, sometimes with major environmental consequences, and has also been instrumental in the development of its rural economy and culture. In this review, we present results of the first interdisciplinary study taking a long-term perspective on sheep management, resource economy and the ecological impacts of sheep grazing, showing that sustainability boundaries are most likely to be exceeded in fragile environments where financial support is linked to the number of sheep produced. The sustainability of sheep grazing can be enhanced by a management regime that promotes grazing densities appropriate to the site and supported by area-based subsidy systems, thus minimizing environmental degradation, encouraging biodiversity and preserving the integrity of ecosystem processes.

AB  - This explorative study aims to gain more insight into Swedish-Iranians' purchase of second homes in Turkey. The study is based on 22 questionnaires (19 of them from owners and buyers), field observation, and participant observation. Motives behind owners' and buyers' purchases are: other Swedish-Iranian friends/relatives bought there; cultural proximity; absence of visa restriction for Iranian citizens; geographical proximity to Iran and relatives living in Iran; economic factors, including the low prices and costs and investment for retirement; and the climate. The respondents are well-integrated into Swedish society and have access to different types of resources which facilitate the purchase, but they also show the potential to partially become integrated socioculturally into their Turkish communities. A meaningful proportion of them are seriously planning to live permanently in Turkey after retirement, but the majority stay there for longer periods or semi-permanently. Despite some limitations, this study makes an important contribution to the area of diaspora second-home tourism and to the field of diaspora studies.

AB  - Dead wood is a typical feature and a key factor of biodiversity in the sense of species richness in natural forests. Late development phases are characterised by a high amount and diversity of dead wood. Because European forests have been intensively managed over long periods of time, the late development phases are scarce or completely missing. Such shortage of the dead wood component has led to a severe loss of habitats for saproxylic species. This has been recognised at the political level by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE). Within the Pan-European Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management, nine improved indicators under the criterion 4: "Maintenance, Conservation and Appropriate Enhancement of Biological Diversity in Forest Ecosystems" have been adopted at the 411 Ministerial Conference in 2003 One of these indicators addresses dead wood. In this paper habitat requirements are identified for saproxylic species groups and their sensitivity towards key criteria of dead wood assessment. The different functional types of dead wood are then defined, categorised and compared to existing assessments within monitoring schemes (national and international). Finally the identified attributes are investigated on their applicability for operational use of monitoring dead wood within monitoring schemes. On this basis, a method of dead wood assessment on the scale of natural and biogeographic regions is suggested.

AB  - The main contribution of this paper is to challenge the current understanding in Swedish spatial planning of power systems being, inherently, alternating current (AC) systems. We propose two areas for piloting local direct current (DC) systems as a way of introducing the concept of mixed AC/DC power systems with the aim of supporting more (self-)sustainable local communities. One is local recreational areas, so called 'green spaces' in urban planning. The other is eHealth, when it involves spatial planning and building, or rebuilding existing living space, for supporting healthcare provision in the patient's own home. The paper discusses how mixed AC/DC power systems might be introduced into the current planning discourse and practice in Sweden as part of the necessary reconceptualization of what sustainability means in spatial planning. The paper is based on the authors' previous and on-going research, in spatial planning and eHealth respectively, and has been inspired by the on-going research and development at IIT-M on robust and affordable local DC solutions for Indian households. It is an early-stage exploratory paper based on a recently initiated interdisciplinary dialogue between computer scientists and spatial planning researchers at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, about green infrastructuring for a more sustainable society.

FX  - Within the framework of the three year Health in Hand project, an Indo-Swedish research and development project jointly funded by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) at the Indian Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA, we have had the excellent opportunity to share knowledge and experiences of developing innovative mobile health technologies for health promotion and disease prevention, in Sweden and India respectively, with our colleagues at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) and the IIT-M Rural Technology and Business Incubator (RTBI). During successive exchange visits to IIT-M and IIT-M Research Park, we were impressed and inspired by the on-going research and rapid development we witnessed of simple, affordable and robust DC solutions for Indian households. These visits were an eye-opener for the participating Swedish researchers. We began to question why mixed AC/DC power systems and local DC power systems were not being discussed and tested in Sweden. This in turn led to interdisciplinary discussions with spatial planning researchers at Blekinge Insitute of Technology, the first concrete result of which is this exploratory paper.

AB  - Understanding the risk of extinction of a single population is an important problem in both theoretical and applied ecology. Local extinction risk depends on several factors, including population size, demographic or environmental stochasticity, natural catastrophe, or the loss of genetic diversity. The probability of local extinction may also be higher in low-quality sink habitats than in high-quality source habitats. We tested this hypothesis by comparing local extinction rates of 15 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) between 1930-1975 and 1995-2003 in central Finland. Local extinction rates were higher in low-quality than in high-quality habitats. Nevertheless, for the three most common species there were no differences in extinction rates between low-and high-quality habitats. Our results suggest that a good understanding of habitat quality is crucial for the conservation of species in heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - The disturbance regime of boreal forests has been substantially altered by human influence in northern Europe. In this context, emulations of natural disturbance have become increasingly common as management tools to minimize negative effects of forestry on biodiversity. In a large-scale habitat-restoration experiment conducted in Norway spruce stands in southern Finland, we tested the effects of controlled burning, partial harvesting, and increasing the amount of downed wood on ground beetles (carabids). We also evaluated the effects of moisture gradients within harvested sites. We collected beetles seven years after the treatments. The moisture gradient was the strongest determinant of carabid assemblages and even after the most intense disturbances, the moist patches within sites still supported fauna characteristic of mire habitats. The species richness of carabids and the number of open-habitat associated species peaked on burned and harvested sites but we did not observe a typical pattern in beetle assemblages whereby numbers of rare species and species unique to post-disturbance habitats were elevated. Our findings suggest that (a) the influx of disturbance-associated species was apparently ephemeral and difficult to observe seven years post disturbance, and (b) moist patches within disturbed sites can serve as refugia for many closed-forest associated carabids over the early phases of post-disturbance succession.

AB  - Information about forest cover is needed by all of the nine societal benefit areas identified by the Group of Earth Observation (GEO). In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This is a study about cultivated and 'wild' plants as components of the material heritage of crofters, an overlooked group of people in former agrarian landscapes. Despite abundant remains of crofts in Sweden, inhabited during the period from the eighteenth century until the 1940s, crofters have been subject to few studies. We used a survey conducted 1967 of botanical remains at abandoned croft as a basis for a re-survey in 2019. As with all biological traces of former human activities, cultivated plants and wild species favoured by former management ultimately disappear, but with long delays. We describe the patterns of this decline. In general, about a third of the species were gone after 52 years. The rate of disappearance of single species occurrences was about 1% annually. We discuss the interpretation of botanical remains from since long abandoned crofts in the context of heritage. In some cases, the botanical remains were the only material evidence left. We conclude that the material heritage of crofters deserves further studies and that botanical remains at abandoned crofts should be documented and at least at some sites protected.

AB  - The Budyko framework characterizes landscape water cycles as a function of climate. We used this framework to identify regions with contrasting hydroclimatic change during the past 50years in Sweden. This analysis revealed three distinct regions: the mountains, the forests, and the areas with agriculture. Each region responded markedly different to recent climate and anthropogenic changes, and within each region, we identified the most sensitive subregions. These results highlight the need for regional differentiation in climate change adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable ecosystems and freshwater resources. Further, the Budyko curve moved systematically towards its water and energy limits, indicating augmentation of the water cycle driven by changing vegetation, climate and human interactions. This finding challenges the steady state assumption of the Budyko curve and therefore its ability to predict future water cycles. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS FLUXES FROM FINNISH AGRICULTURAL AREAS TO THE BALTIC SEA
T2  - NORDIC HYDROLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Nutrient losses from small drainage basins were compared to the nutrient fluxes in small coastal rivers in order to study the representativeness of the Finnish monitoring network of small basins, especially as regards agricultural loading to the Baltic Sea. Additionally flux estimates from the period 1986-1990 were compared to those of the period 1981-1985 in order detect possible trends. The results suggest that in coastal regions with high proportions of agricultural land and with low lake percentage, the nutrient losses from agricultural areas mostly enter coastal waters with negligible retention in river channels. The net effect of the various processes in the rivers is small because most of the nutrient losses occur in spring, fall or early winter in connection with high water flows and current velocities, short residence times of water and low intensities of biogeochemical processes. Nitrogen losses from agriculture has probably increased during the 1980s due to increased winter flows and increased use of nitrogen fertilizers. The results indicate that nitrogen loading of the southern and south-western coastal waters of Finland has increased as well.

AB  - Mire degradation due to drainage for forestry results in the loss of mire specialist species. To halt the loss in biodiversity, ecological restoration is needed and already implemented. However, a major challenge in ecological restoration is whether actions taken have the desired outcome. Key abiotic and biotic conditions for the successful restoration of invertebrate communities can be identified by testing the "Field of Dreams" hypothesis, which postulates that if a habitat is successfully restored, species will return. This study was conducted in nine boreal mires located in Eastern Finland, 1-3 years after restoration. Parts of each mire were drained for forestry during the 1960s and 1970s, and restored in 2003-2006. Two 250m transects were established in each of three treatments (pristine, drained, restored) per mire. We used pitfall trapping to sample carabid beetles and spiders, sweep netting to sample micromoths and crane flies and counts along the transects to sample macromoths. Vegetation cover, water table level, and climatic variables were measured along all transects. Mire specialist species and invertebrate communities responded positively to restoration and negatively to drainage, whereas generalists showed varied responses. In addition, mire specialists were associated with high cover of Sphagnum mosses and with low numbers of tall trees (>3 m). Therefore, to successfully restore populations and communities of mire specialist invertebrates, maintaining environmental conditions that favor the growth of Sphagnum mosses, rewetting the sites and removing larger trees are necessary measures.

AB  - Metapopulation theory predicts that species richness and total population density of habitat specialists increase with increasing area and regional connectivity of the habitat. To test these predictions, we examined the relative contributions of habitat patch area, connectivity of the regional habitat network and local habitat quality to species richness and total density of butterflies and day-active moths inhabiting semi-natural grasslands. We studied butterflies and moths in 48 replicate landscapes situated in southwest Finland, including a focal patch and the surrounding network of other semi-natural grasslands within a radius of 1.5 km from the focal patch. By applying the method of hierarchical partitioning, which can distinguish between independent and joint contributions of individual explanatory variables, we observed that variables of the local habitat quality (e.g. mean vegetation height and nectar plant abundance) generally showed the highest independent effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. Habitat area did not show a significant independent contribution to species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. The effect of habitat connectivity was observed only for total density of the declining butterflies and moths. These observations indicate that the local habitat quality is of foremost importance in explaining variation in species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. In addition, declining butterflies and moths have larger populations in well-connected networks of semi-natural grasslands. Our results suggest that, while it is crucial to maintain high-quality habitats by management, with limited resources it would be appropriate to concentrate grassland management and restoration to areas with well-connected grassland networks in which the declining species currently have their strongest populations.

AB  - Sheep farmers in areas with large carnivores experience economic loss, psychological stress, and perceived alienation from political processes. This can result in decisions that differ from those made by farmers in areas without large carnivores, possibly influencing the whole farming system. We used applications for farming subsidies to examine changes in sheep farming in Norway 1999 to 2017. Along the urban-rural dimension, we found a stronger decline in increasingly rural areas. The decline was furthermore larger inside regions used for the reintroduction of large carnivores than outside these regions. The observed decline in some regions was compensated by growth in central regions, outside carnivore prone areas, and on managed land where the sheep was protected from carnivores. The result complements studies of mental dispositions and decision processes aiming to explain how large carnivores and the carnivore management policy influence the farmers' attitudes and decisions, resulting in behaviors that effect larger social systems.

AB  - Nutrient leaching from agricultural production is still recognised as a major environmental problem in Finland. To estimate agricultural nitrogen loading under changing land-use and climate conditions, the Integrated Nitrogen Model for Catchments (INCA) was applied in Savijoki, a small (15.4 km(2)) agricultural catchment, which represents the intensively cultivated areas in south-western Finland. Hydrological calibration and testing of the INCA model was first carried out in Savjoki during 1981-2000. In spite of heterogeneous soil and land-use conditions, INCA was able to reproduce the overall hydrological regime in the stream. The model was calibrated further in respect of nitrogen processes during 1995-2000. The model was able, reasonably well, to simulate the overall annual dynamics of the inorganic N concentrations in the stream water and the annual N export from the catchment. The average simulated NO3-N export was 550 k- N km(-2) yr(-1) and the observed one (constituting more than half of the annual total N export) was 592 kg N km(-2) yr(-1). For NH4-N, the simulated export was somewhat higher than that measured but NH4-N was only 4% of the total N export. In spite of some underestimation of flow and N concentration during extreme hydrological conditions, the INCA model proved to be a useful too for analysing flow pattern and inorganic nitrogen leaching in a small agricultural catchment, characterised by a rapid response to rainfall.

AB  - This paper presents a methodological synthesis of two congruent approaches into a common landscape change trajectory analysis and the assessment of landscape dynamics and sustainability. The emphasis of the analysis is on the retrospective relationship between the past and the present-day landscape patterns and associated key biotopes. The example key biotopes, oak woodlands and grasslands, represent valuable habitats in the hermboreal landscapes of Finland and Sweden. The paper presents a conceptual stepwise approach for change trajectory analysis utilising multiple spatio-temporal data and techniques available in image processing and geographical information systems (GIS) including the following steps: (I) specification of spatio-temporal data and their representation of target objects, (II) the choice of direct or indirect change trajectory analysis, (III) hierarchical structuring of landscape information, (IV) compilation of landscape information into a GIS database, and (V) identification of paths for landscape change trajectory analysis. In this case study, we have focused on three interlinked trajectory analysis approaches, and their role in the assessment of landscape sustainability from a potential biodiversity perspective. We conclude that proposed landscape change trajectory analysis can improve the assessment of the key biotopes as well as present-day landscape characteristics, in maintaining biodiversity and related ecological values by providing information on landscape stability, continuity, change processes and boundary dynamics. This approach can be useful in the assessment of natural capital, but requires data-specific and context sensitive data processing and analysis solutions. The results should be interpreted as an approximation and generalisation of the spatio-temporal complexity of landscape reality and therefore be used in conjunction with additional habitat function measures.

AB  - This study investigated public preferences for natural boreal forests, including their perceptions of important structural elements for biodiversity like dead and downed wood. We designed an experimental internet survey using nine versions of a questionnaire with each version featuring a unique combination of original photographs, additional text and digitally edited photographs. Survey participants (N=2701) rated photographs of forest settings with dead wood digitally removed substantially higher than the corresponding original non -edited photographs. However, respondents' familiarity with the ecological role dead wood provides for forest biodiversity and natural forest dynamics increased their perception of its appearance. Additional text containing information about dead wood's ecological benefits, either alone or combined with information about its influence on economic benefits, had almost the same effect as pure ecological text. Additional text with information about either economic or socioeconomic aspects of forests including dead wood had no effect on the participants' ratings. We also observed a learning effect of additional ecological text: text provided in a previous section of the questionnaire affected participants' ratings of photographs shown later without text. We conclude that well formulated, trusted and targeted information about the ecological role of dead wood can positively influence public support for multi -goal forest policies. Our results may also imply that in cases where the capacity to inform the public about dead wood's importance is limited, managers might consider removing dead wood from the most frequently visited areas in forests where recreation is the primary management goal.

AB  - Tourism industry and government demand for knowledge of the impacts of climate change on ski tourism is growing. Despite the more than 70-year history and large cultural significance of alpine skiing in Sweden, little is known about the industry's future under a changing climate. This study applies the SkiSim2 model with low to high emission scenarios (RCP2.6 to 8.5) to analyse the implications of climate change for ski operations (season length, snowmaking requirements) at 23 alpine ski areas across Sweden for the early, mid and late twenty-first century. Northern areas of Sweden show much less reduction in average season length compared to central and southern Sweden under the high emission mid- (13% versus 58% and 81%) and late-century scenarios (27% versus 72% and 99%). To limit season losses in these scenarios, snow production increases of over 250% are required in all regions. Such increases will create additional financial and environmental stressors, which may lead to the closure of the most at-risk resorts. With greater impacts projected for much of the European Alps ski market, northern Sweden may represent a 'last resort' for the European ski industry under higher emission scenarios by the mid-late twenty-first century.

AB  - Land-use and environmental planning typically involves diverse actors such as representatives of government authorities and administrations, special interest organisations, scientific experts, lawyers, stakeholders and concerned citizens. During the course of the planning process, communication is not limited to written documents. The Swedish Environmental Code also calls for public meetings and consultation efforts with stakeholders. Considering that public meetings have a prominent role in environmental planning, there is surprisingly little research on the form, content and development over time of face-to-face communication and social interaction taking place. This article addresses communication and interaction at public meetings concerning a facility siting project of considerable longevity - the building of a railway tunnel through the Hallandsas in southern Sweden. Using data from participant observation of local public consultation meetings regarding the Hallandsas railway tunnel through a period of several years, this paper analyses and discusses communication about environmental risk. The theoretical foundation derives from pragmatic communication theory, Niklas Luhmann's distinction between risk and hazard, and social anthropological theory on agency and conflict generation in communication.

AB  - Reliable estimates of past land cover are critical for assessing potential effects of anthropogenic land-cover changes on past earth surface-climate feedbacks and landscape complexity. Fossil pollen records from lakes and bogs have provided important information on past natural and human-induced vegetation cover. However, those records provide only point estimates of past land cover, and not the spatially continuous maps at regional and sub-continental scales needed for climate modelling.
   We propose a set of statistical models that create spatially continuous maps of past land cover by combining two data sets: 1) pollen-based point estimates of past land cover (from the REVEALS model) and 2) spatially continuous estimates of past land cover, obtained by combining simulated potential vegetation (from LPJ-GUESS) with an anthropogenic land-cover change scenario (KK10). The proposed models rely on statistical methodology for compositional data and use Gaussian Markov Random Fields to model spatial dependencies in the data.
   Land-cover reconstructions are presented for three time windows in Europe: 0.05, 0.2, and 6 ka years before present (BP). The models are evaluated through cross-validation, deviance information criteria and by comparing the reconstruction of the 0.05 ka time window to the present-day land-cover data compiled by the European Forest Institute (EFI). For 0.05 ka, the proposed models provide reconstructions that are closer to the EFI data than either the REVEALS- or LPJ-GUESS/KK10-based estimates; thus the statistical combination of the two estimates improves the reconstruction. The reconstruction by the proposed models for 0.2 ka is also good. For 6 ka, however, the large differences between the REVEALS- and LPJ-GUESS/KK10-based estimates reduce the reliability of the proposed models. Possible reasons for the increased differences between REVEALS and LPJ-GUESS/KK10 for older time periods and further improvement of the proposed models are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent studies and literature suggest that negative attitudes towards large carnivores may to a large extent be explained by ignorance and lack of certain aspects of cultural capital. Fear and resistance, it has been argued, can be overcome through spreading information and knowledge about carnivores and how to interact with them. This argument has, on the other hand, been interpreted as an example of inherent arrogance among urban elites, undermining the economic foundation and quality of life in rural areas. The article aims to analyse acceptance of bears in Norway among a representative sample of the population, to describe attitudes towards large carnivores, economic and cultural capital, the importance of physical and geographical closeness, and the extent to which and how these factors are interlinked. The analysis is based on two national quantitative surveys, carried out in 2005 and 2007. The findings show a clear, although small, increase in resistance to the existence of bears in Norway. The increase appears to be most marked among young people who have grown up in rural areas. The authors conclude that there is an increasing urban-rural divide on the issue of conservation policies and carnivore stock management.

AB  - Denmark, Germany, and Finland are countries that have emerged as technology leaders in key renewable energy fields-wind energy, solar power, and bioenergy. In this article, we dig into the policy trajectories of these countries and concentrate particularly on a phenomenon that is common for them all-the long-term commitment to promoting particular renewable energy (RE) technologies. Analyzing commitment, its causes and its consequences, can be considered important, as earlier findings show that long-term, consistent policy signals are a key for policy success. In this article, we point out that this 'sticking' to a RE technology has emerged and manifested in multiple ways in the case countries. Examples include relying on existing cultural capacities when navigating energy policy direction, strategically promoting scaling of technology markets to root new energy practices in society and developing energy policies as an extension of existing socio-technical structures. In order to understand these dynamics in more depth, we utilize literature on policy robustness and resilience. While all the case countries, Denmark, Germany, and Finland, have generated robust RE policy goals, Finland has failed to foster resilience simultaneously. We conclude that analysing stickiness of policy elements can be fruitful when seeking to understand and design transformative policies. Further, it can be taken as a complementary analytical perspective in the policy mix studies.

AB  - This study explores the impact of seasonality on hotel firms' financial performance and whether this impact depends on tourism destinations and the variations of the tourism demand distinguished by domestic market and international market. Financial performance is measured by the most commonly-applied indicator, Return on Assets (ROA), which is further decomposed to profit margin and asset turnover. The present study contributes to the literature by evaluating the importance of pricing strategies and marketing efforts in alleviating the negative effect of seasonal demand. Dynamic panel models at both the national and regional levels are applied to a sample, including the accounting data of all Norwegian hotel firms between 2008 and 2017. Our empirical findings suggest that the impact of seasonality on financial performance depends on market segments and varies across tourism destinations. Additionally, seasonality has a stronger impact on profit margin than on asset turnover, indicating that marketing strategies and pricing and revenue management techniques can effectively alleviate the negative impact of seasonality.

AB  - Global demand for food, including rising consumption of meat and dairy products, is increasing pressure on the environment and natural resources, often in locations distant from points of consumption. To identify and quantify consumer driven impacts and the components of the supply chain where sustainability interventions will be most effective, spatially explicit consumption-linked indicators that encompass environmental risks are required. Large amounts of phosphorus fertilizers are used in Brazilian soybean cultivation, which potentially cause eutrophication and impact freshwater species. We use a sub-national trade model to develop a spatially explicit approach for assessing commodity-driven phosphorus fertilizer use and its potential impact on biodi-versity linked to four key consumers. The use of phosphorus for embedded consumption per capita of Brazilian soybean in China, the EU, the UK, and Sweden are estimated at municipal level and combined with metrics that influence losses of phosphorus to create a normalised relative risk index. The relative risk index is presented in geospatial visualisations to explore geographical patterns of risk to freshwater biodiversity and make the link between consumer and producer countries less obscure. The results indicate high phosphorus-linked species risk in municipalities within Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul, Paran ' a, and Goi ' as. Sweden and the UK generate the highest relative risk and the geographical patterns of risk differ between the investigated consuming countries, showing that smaller countries can have relatively large impacts at a spatially explicit scale. In the Amazon biome, risk of nutrient losses and biodiversity are relatively high, creating concerns as soybean production is expanding into the area. The results and methodological approach can contribute to understanding of accountability, agency, and increased transparency for the governance of global supply chains, necessary for enabling transformations towards sustainable food systems.

AB  - The effects, in terms of economic value and harvest potential, of adopting restricted timber management practices promoting the preservation of biodiversity are analysed in a 5620 ha boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. A forest management model based on ecological principles aiming at preservation of biodiversity, e.g. by adopting restricted silvicultural treatments imitating the effects of natural processes, such as forest fires, is applied. The forest area is divided into four separate classes reflecting the probabilities of forest fires, and different treatment options are assigned to each of the classes. These options comprise extended rotation periods and treatments such as clear-cutting with retention of seed trees and shelterwood cutting. A management problem specified as maximization of net present value subject to a requirement to preserve (medium term) about 10% of the forest area for a period of 70 yrs is solved by means of linear programming. Compared with current timber management practices, the net present value of the restricted management problem is reduced by 14% (15%) for a real rate of discount of 3% (4%) pro anno. The annual harvest flow is reduced by 11-33%. For a management problem comprising even-flow harvesting constraints in addition to biodiversity constraints, the net present value is reduced by 16% (19%).

AB  - Pre-crop values are used to indicate the benefits of a previous crop for a subsequent crop in crop sequencing. A better understanding and research on pre-crop values has the potential to facilitate the diversification of crop production. Despite the various benefits of diversification, the limited knowledge and incentives concerning the pre-crop values in the market conditions have contributed to the persistence of cereal-dominated land use. The present study evaluated the benefits of utilizing pre-crop values in a Finnish context. Results based on dynamic optimization modelling showed that incorporating more information on pre-crop values into farmers' decision-making contributes to increased net present values (NPV). The adoption of pre-crop values was analysed under five different scenarios: Removal of the Common Agricultural Policy land constraints, 30% increase in labour costs, +/-10% change in crop prices, and 30% increase in N fertilizer price. Under each scenario, the response of the baseline model (without pre-crop values) was compared to the response of the model with pre-crop values. In all scenarios, the results of the model with pre-crop values showed higher NPVs, higher yields and slightly lower GHG emissions. Hence, increasing knowledge and utilization of pre-crop values may significantly promote shifts towards more sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Increased mortality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and spreading of deciduous trees are observed in the Swiss Rhone valley. Previous research identified climate change effects as main drivers of this trend. On the local scale, we hypothesize that legacies from past anthropogenic disturbances are superimposed on climate effects.
   We reconstructed land-use history and quantified changes in tree species composition from 1930 to 1994 on 9468 ha of forested land. The aim was to analyze the contribution of anthropogenic disturbances to the observed changes and to disentangle human impact from climate change effects.
   At altitudes below 1 200 m a.s.l. we found a shift from pine (-11.4%) to deciduous trees (+11%) with significantly lower increase of deciduous trees in stands formerly used for grazing and/or litter collecting. Conversely, pine decrease was not correlated with former anthropogenic disturbances. We interpret pine mortality as an effect of increased drought stress due to climate change while spread of deciduous trees is driven by land-use change. Grazing and litter collecting hindered deciduous tree regeneration and it was not until their abandonment a few decades ago that forest composition started to change. At higher elevations the shift from Norway spruce (Picea abies; -8.5%) to European larch (Larix decidua; +8.2%) corresponds to silvicultural management schemes, aimed at promoting larch recruitment.
   Our study illustrates the importance of disentangling climate from land-use change effects for understanding shifts in forest composition. The findings are relevant for other regions in the European Alps where forests undergo comparable environmental changes.

AB  - Bioeconomy is portrayed by the EU and several national governments as a central element contributing to sustainability strategies and a post-fossil transformation. This paper critically engages with extractivist patterns and tendencies in the forest sector as one of the main bio-based sectors. It argues that despite the official endorsement of circularity and renewability in the forest-based bioeconomy, current developments of modern bioeconomy might threaten sustainability prospects. The Finnish forest-based bioeconomy and one of its well-known showcase projects, the bioproduct mill (BPM) in the municipality of aanekoski, serve as a case study in this paper. The forest-based bioeconomy in Finland is scrutinized as a potential continuation or consolidation of extractivist patterns, rather than an alternative to these tendencies. The lens of extractivism is applied to identify possible extractivist and unsustainable characteristics of the case study which are discussed along the following dimensions: (A) degree of export orientation and processing, (B) the scale, scope, and speed of extraction, (C) socio-economic and environmental impacts, and (D) subjective relations to nature. The extractivist lens provides analytical value to scrutinizing practices, principles, and dynamics of the contested political field and vision of bioeconomy in the Finnish forest sector. The analysis results in a discussion of latent and manifest social, political, and ecological contradictions within the forest-based bioeconomy in Finland. Based on its analytical lens and the empirical case of the BPM in aanekoski, it can be concluded that extractivist patterns and tendencies are perpetuated within the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy.

AB  - Wildlife species living in proximity with humans often suffer from various anthropogenic factors. Here, we focus on the endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis), which lives in close connection with humans in Lake Saimaa, Finland. This unique endemic population has remained landlocked since the last glacial period, and it currently consists of only similar to 400 individuals. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the Saimaa ringed seal, identify the main risk factors and discuss the efficacy of conservation actions put in place to ensure its long-term survival. The main threats for this rare subspecies are bycatch mortality, habitat destruction and increasingly mild winters. Climate change, together with small population size and an extremely impoverished gene pool, forms a new severe threat. The main conservation actions and priorities for the Saimaa ringed seal are implementation of fishing closures, land-use planning, protected areas, and reduction of pup mortality. Novel innovations, such as provisioning of artificial nest structures, may become increasingly important in the future. Although the Saimaa ringed seal still faces the risk of extinction, the current positive trend in the number of seals shows that endangered wildlife populations can recover even in regions with considerable human inhabitation, when legislative protection is combined with intensive research, engagement of local inhabitants, and innovative conservation actions. Such multifaceted conservation approaches are needed in a world with a growing human population and a rapidly changing climate.

AB  - Salmon lice infestation is a challenge for wild post-smolt salmon during migration from their natal river to the sea in several regions of Norway. The traffic-light management system regulates growth in the aquaculture industry, where growth in production (6 %) is only allowed if the impact of salmon lice on wild fish can be kept at a minimum and up to 10% mortality of wild salmonids are considered within the sustainability goal. We used a numerical ocean model, combined with an individual-based model for salmon lice, to evaluate the interannual variability in salmon lice concentrations in Production Zone 7, which was granted permission for production growth in 2017. Salmon lice releases were kept constant for 3 yr, while the physical conditions, e.g. wind and ocean circulation, varied. The total area of elevated lice infestations varied between 3.2 and 8.4 % of the area within 5 km from the coast, due only to interannual physical variability mainly caused by variable wind patterns. Modeled post-smolts migrating out from the Namsen River (64.5 degrees N, central Norway) towards the open ocean experienced mortality between 5 and 9%. Since Production Zone 7 was granted growth, we have simulated increased production and corresponding increases in lice releases. After 5 to 8 increments of 6% increase in production, the increase in salmon post-smolt mortality was of the same order of magnitude as the interannual variability. Information regarding migration route and time is crucial input to the model calculating post-smolt mortality, and inadequate information can affect the results significantly. These 2 methods (determining area of elevated lice infestations and estimating post-smolt mortality) provide complementary information and should be used in combination when the overall assessment of a production zone is made.

AB  - It is only relatively recently that national adaptation strategies have begun to develop measures by which forestry can adapt to climate change; often those measures opt to use a relatively general strategy for coping under conditions of disturbance. Particularly in states using intensive forest management, such as Sweden, this approach marks a departure from current strategies for achieving maximum yield. In other countries, however, where the economic output from forestry is less significant and interests such as biodiversity, local use and tourism, may figure more prominently, the conditions for developing risk-based forest management may be more manifest. This study reviews literature on adaptations in forest management, and analyzes country reports submitted as part of an EU27 project. The study concludes that the diverse prerequisites and policies of states have seldom been reflected in the design of adaptation management actions to date.

AB  - The aim of the reformed EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2014-2020 is to enhance greening via an ecological focus area, arable crop diversification, and the maintenance of permanent grasslands. This study tests the greening process in the case of agricultural landscape in southwestern Finland by projecting land use between 2005 and 2017. The study method integrates the quantitative results of Markov chains and spatial features of a cellular automata model. Initially, land use change was recognized by appropriate metrics. The trend of greening following the CAP policy indicated that permanent grassland patches were more persistent with forest patches than agricultural land that lost its vegetated strips to neighboring land use patches. The modeling approach was demonstrated to provide acceptable performance when used as a spatial assessment tool for observing critical patch level changes reflecting the greening agricultural policy.

AB  - 1. Habitat use by colour-marked lapwing Vanellus vanellus broods was studied at three coastal farmland sites in S.W. Sweden from 1987 to 1990.
   2. Initial brood movements between nest sites and home ranges used for chick-rearing varied between 7 and 332 m. At all sites, the proportions of habitats within lapwing home ranges differed from availability. Sea shore pasture was relatively the most used habitat. Lapwings selected home ranges with lower proportions of arable fields and moist pasture relative to sea shore pasture, and at two sites also to the shore, than expected if choice was due to availability.
   3. Lapwing broods did not select feeding habitats in relation to availability, Feeding on sea shore pasture, and at one site also on the shore, occurred more frequently than expected relative to the use of arable fields and moist pasture. Foraging on the short was constrained by variation in sea water level. Broods from nests on arable fields left the nest site habitat, and used the same feeding habitats as broods hatched on pastures.
   4. Chicks fed on a wide variety of prey organisms, representing terrestrial, marine and freshwater invertebrates, Sampling of potential food supply suggested that numbers and biomass of invertebrates included in the chick diet were greater on a sea shore pasture than on an adjacent moist pasture.
   5. Loss of important chick foraging habitats and isolation of nest sites and chick-rearing habitats, caused by changes in agricultural land use, have probably contributed to the decline of lapwings breeding on farmland in Europe, The results are related to conservation of this and other waders breeding on farmland.

AB  - This article presents research carried out in Norway, among the population of livestock farmers. It analyses farmers' understanding of animal welfare, and how their different concerns about animal welfare varies across farmers' considerations about the role of the agricultural sector in Norwegian society and animal welfare reg-ulations, material conditions at the farm level, farmers' opinion about animal rights activist groups, and in several individual characteristics. The empirical material was derived from a postal survey conducted in 2020 (n = 745); the analyses were conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM) which has its advantage in iden-tifying latent attitudes. Informed by convention theory, the study shows that two conventions of animal welfare were most prominent among Norwegian livestock farmers. One emphasizing animals' basic health and feelings and a second animals'natural needs. These two conventions point to a potential split within the livestock farming population. Support for the convention basic health and feelings coincides with efficiency and effectiveness in Norwegian food production and farmers' contribution to feeding the Norwegian population. Support of the convention natural needs coincides with support for enhancing biodiversity and attractive landscapes as important additional values in Norwegian agriculture. The support for the convention of animals' needs to behave naturally was found to be lower than the basic health and feelings and this might slow down or hinder implementation of practices and future regulations aimed at enhancing the natural needs of farm animals, ac-commodation to public expectations of good animal welfare, and is potentially challenging the farmers' social license to farm animals.

AB  - The boreal forest is in transition. Large areas in remote regions are still in a pristine state, but extensive exploitation or intensive management for wood production dominates in Russia, Canada and the Nordic countries. The broadened view that forests are sources of other products than wood as well as of biodiversity is gradually becoming internationally accepted. To sustain the boreal forest for the future it must be realised that the forest has to be sustained as a system rather than as a number of utilities that can be considered separately. In northern Europe the situation is particularly striking with a strong contrast between the adjacent boreal forests in Scotland, Sweden and Finland on the one hand, and the north-west of Russia on the other. The two regions differ by history, type of land use and economic system but they are basically biologically similar. Combining sustainable wood production and maintenance of biodiversity and other values means setting limits to the intensity and extent of forest management. If the impact has been large, it is also necessary to build more natural features into managed systems. Developing a sustained boreal forest system by management of forests and forests reserves can be more efficient if research, education and management are well integrated. Scientists, teachers and managers must meet frequently and interact. In this way the time-lag between the advent of new knowledge and its implementation in the field can be reduced. We argue that co-operation among contrasting regions like the east and the west provides a unique opportunity for such integration, We review the problems and requirements in the west and the east, respectively, by contrasting Scotland, Sweden and the Komi Republic in Russia. The experiences are different and therefore complementary to each other. This assures long-term benefits of joint action.

AB  - This article analyses the consequences of institutional and organisational arrangements for the legitimacy of the governance of Finnish public forests. It focuses on normative legitimacy, which comprises input legitimacy (accountability), throughput legitimacy (power relationships, transparency and inclusiveness) and output legitimacy (problem-solving capacity). These components, and the challenges involved in them, are analysed in relation to the governance of the Finnish Forest and Park Service. It is a hybrid agency which combines business economic tasks with broader societal duties related to public forests. The article draws on the relevant laws, parliamentary reports and comments, policy and planning documents, as well as interviews with MPs, government officials and agency staff. The discrepancy between written regulations and policies on the one hand, and the actual governance practices and rationalities that guide informants' interpretations and implementation of the regulations on the other, constitutes (in addition to the regulatory vagueness) the key challenge to the system's legitimacy. The Finnish case shows that assigning to Parliament a central formal role in the governance of public forests may serve more as window-dressing than providing genuine legitimacy to the decisions being made, as its actual role is dependent on how - and by whom - such decisions are prepared. The results highlight the importance of inclusiveness and transparency in the governance process; and of concrete, measurable criteria and indicators for each policy goal, against which performance may be assessed on a regular basis.

AB  - Plant species of semi-natural grasslands are threatened by several simultaneous global change drivers, most notably land-use and climate change. In this study, we explore spatiotemporal variation and changes in deterministic (lambda) and stochastic population growth rates (lambda(s)), and the underlying vital rates of eight populations of Arnica montana at the species' north-western range margin in Norway. We assess to what extent variation in the demographic rates could be attributed to environmental correlates of the key global change drivers likely to operate at the range edge, including population size, surrogates of habitat quality, temperature and precipitation. We found no relationship between lambda and population size or habitat quality, but lambda declined in response to both increasing precipitation and increasing temperature. Life-table response experiments revealed that the temporal variability was driven by survival and clonality, whereas the spatial variation was driven by clonality. Our results suggest that A. montana has a threshold response to increasing precipitation, likely due to adaptations to local climatic conditions. Growth and flowering were both negatively affected by increasing temperature, but these effects had a low influence on the spatiotemporal variability in lambda. In contrast, the stochastic growth rate was negatively influenced by climate change, indicating an increased extinction risk for marginal populations, possibly leading to range contraction of A. montana as climate change proceeds. Altogether, our study illustrates how the fates of peripheral populations, which are critically important in species range dynamics, may be affected by both deterministic and stochastic effects of multiple coinciding global change drivers.

AB  - Context Structural and functional connectivity, as subconcepts of landscape connectivity, are key factors in biodiversity conservation and management. Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms. Objectives As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape. Methods We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity. Results We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape. Conclusions Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages. Even clustered ponds need dispersal from other habitats to ensure their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse how Finnish customers at the pop-up restaurant event Trip to Province, which took place in South Ostrobothnia, Finland, make sense of the locality.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data consist of 3 group interviews and 18 respondents, whose responses were analysed using a frame analysis.
   Findings - Locality is discussed in the context of three frames: the immediate surroundings, the Finnish national ethos and the global discourses of food enthusiasts. The results show that, in terms of local food events, locality comprises not only food, but also place, people and cultural context conveying national and global elements.
   Research limitations/implications - The data of this study are limited in size, and limited to the Finnish context.
   Practical implications - Local food events could be promoted to locals and nearby residents, not just to tourists. With the design of the eating environment (music and visuals), the local food experience can be enhanced.
   Social implications - Local food events strengthen the residents' regional identity.
   Originality/value - The research setting for this paper is original; the study takes part in the scarce discussion about gastronomic tourism in Finland. The study broadens the view that local food is just about food; regarding local food events, locality also entails place, people, nationality and globality.

AB  - Hydropower production is a key electricity generation technology in many parts of the world which can play a significant role in the transition towards a green and clean energy system. Hydropower can mobilize flexible energy on demand (hydropeaking) to balance out intermittent electricity from wind and photovoltaics. Adoption of hydropower as a peaking power source could lead to increased frequency of flow ramping in rivers downstream hydropower tailraces, which is one of the main stressors for riverine biota in alpine rivers. Both planned and accidental shutdowns of hydropower turbines need ecological mitigation. Our survey revealed that >3000 km of rivers downstream ca 800 hydropower plants in Norway may be ecologically impacted by non-natural flow fluctuations, and few have appropriate mitigation thresholds. A considerable eco-friendly peaking service may come from the Norwegian hydropower portfolio of over 19 GW installed capacity, with outlets into fjords, reservoirs or other large water bodies which normally dampen the ecological impacts of flow ramping. Intensive flow ramping occurs with irregular intervals from most types of hydropower. Although the highest frequency of stops were revealed in hydropower turbines not impacting river flow from storage hydropower, a significant number of turbine flow stops lasting over half a day in most types and categories of diversion hydropower.

AB  - Land use is likely to be a key driver of population dynamics of species inhabiting anthropogenic landscapes, such as farmlands. Understanding the relationships between land use and variation in population growth rates is therefore critical for the management of many farmland species. Using 24 years of data of a declining farmland bird in an integrated population model, we examined how spatiotemporal variation in land use (defined as habitats with Short and Tall ground vegetation during the breeding season) and habitat-specific demographic parameters relates to variation in population growth taking into account individual movements between habitats. We also evaluated contributions to population growth using transient life table response experiments which gives information on contribution of past variation of parameters and real-time elasticities which suggests future scenarios to change growth rates. LTRE analyses revealed a clear contribution of Short habitats to the annual variation in population growth rate that was mostly due to fledgling recruitment, whereas there was no evidence for a contribution of Tall habitats. Only 18% of the variation in population growth was explained by the modeled local demography, the remaining variation being explained by apparent immigration (i.e., the residual variation). We discuss potential biological and methodological reasons for high contributions of apparent immigration in open populations. In line with LTRE analysis, real-time elasticity analysis revealed that demographic parameters linked to Short habitats had a stronger potential to influence population growth rate than those of Tall habitats. Most particularly, an increase of the proportion of Short sites occupied by Old breeders could have a distinct positive impact on population growth. High-quality Short habitats such as grazed pastures have been declining in southern Sweden. Converting low-quality to high-quality habitats could therefore change the present negative population trend of this, and other species with similar habitat requirements.

AB  - In order to decrease the amount of accidents or mitigate the consequences of them, today's vehicles are being equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. The functionality and design of these systems is almost entirely based on research related to the driving concerns in Western countries. However, with the rapid motorization in developing countries such as China, there is an increasing need to investigate how these systems should be designed for new and growing markets. In order to address this need, research was conducted to discover the most common traffic problems facing Chinese drivers, how those problems differ from those for drivers in a country with a more developed driving culture (Sweden), and what consequences these differences will have for the design of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. Results show that, even though Swedish and Chinese traffic rules and regulations are similar, driver behavior is highly culturally mediated. Results also indicate that the type of assistance drivers need in different traffic situations depends a great deal on driver behavior. The observed differences between Swedish and Chinese drivers suggest that Advanced Driver Assistance Systems designed for roads in Sweden may not necessarily be optimal in other markets.

AB  - Long forest continuity has often been linked with high conservation value in western European Quercus and Fagus woodlands, but this assumption of long continuity has rarely been tested. Birks discussed the antiquity of bryophyte-rich Quercus woodland in western United Kingdom, presenting evidence that the modern plant communities developed during the late Holocene influenced by human activities. We use pollen data from forest hollows to show that the modern communities within ancient woodlands are all significantly influenced by recent human disturbance. A short period of deforestation in Johnny's Wood, Cumbria, UK dates from the late 19th century and is not of Viking age as previously thought. The brief opening of the forest is associated with the local loss of Tilia cordata and Taxus baccata, but a rich bryophyte community exists today. Rich lichen floras of high conservation interest growing on Fagus sylvatica in south-western Sweden occur despite a recent history of human disturbance and local immigration of Fagus as recently as the 9th century ad. Wistman's Wood, Cornwall, UK had a diverse tree flora until the 11th century ad and then experienced heavy browsing and grazing until ad 1850, after which time the present Quercus woodland developed with its associated flora of high conservation value. Most western European forests today have long and diverse histories of anthropogenic disturbance and current conservation values incorporate both natural and cultural features. Pollen studies with high spatial resolution demonstrate that simple temporal concepts like natural baselines' and the continuity of forest cover underestimate the complexity of the past. Long forest continuity may be of importance for the local survival of higher plants, but for the insects, fungi, lichens and bryophytes that are so valued in contemporary European temperate and boreal forests, habitat diversity maintained by dynamic processes would appear to be of greater significance.

AB  - Mine developments in Indigenous territories risk disrupting Indigenous cultures and their economies, including spiraling already high levels of conflict. This is the situation in Canada, Sweden, and Norway, as elsewhere, and is fostered by current state legal framework that reflect historical trajectories, although circumstances are gradually changing. Promising institutional changes have taken place in British Columbia (BC), Canada, with respect to new legislative reforms. Notably, new legislation from 2019 intends to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in the province, by promoting consent-based and collaborative decision-making mechanisms. New environmental assessment legislation is another example; this legislation includes early engagement, collaborative decision-making, and Indigenous-led assessments. The article's aim is, first, to analyze how Indigenous communities can influence and engage in the mining permitting system of BC, and, secondly, to highlight the positive features of the BC system using a comparative lens to identify opportunities for Sweden and Norway regarding mining permitting and Indigenous rights. Applying a legal-scientific and comparative analysis, the article analyzes traditional legal sources. The article concludes that the strong points that the BC regime could offer the two Nordic countries are: the concept of reconciliation, incorporation of UNDRIP, the spectrum of consultation and engagement approaches, and the structure of environmental assessments. All three jurisdictions, however, struggle with balancing mine developments and securing Indigenous authority and influence over land uses in their traditional territories.

AB  - Collaborative planning has become an increasingly popular approach in environmental decision-making, particularly in situations where there are multiple actors with conflicting interests. In this paper, collaborative environmental planning is perceived as being embedded in an institutional environment that has an impact on the processes and outcomes of planning. Building on the theory of new institutionalism, the paper combines legal analysis of forest regulation with interviews and policy document data from two case studies on collaborative Natural Resource Planning in state-owned forests in Finland. These approaches will be used to analyse how formal regulations and informal norms are interpreted and implemented in the planning processes. The paper highlights the important role institutions can play in promoting or hindering successful collaborative planning, and makes recommendations for developing a forest governance system that is equipped to deal with the identified challenges.

Part I, Competence Management and Development in Finnish logistics Centers describes the process and the methods of competence management and development carried out in the ESLogC project as well as the results of competence identification, competence assessment and competence acquisition carried out in the project. Part II, Finnish Logistics Education is a study of the present state of logistics education at Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland and its development needs based on the results of the competence assessment survey.
   The competence demands in the future logistics centers include following five main competence areas: 1) supply chain management, 2) operations planning, competence management, 3) IT operated operations measurement, follow-up and assessment, 4) competence management, 5) cooperation.
   Based on future competence demands, the clearest weaknesses of current logistics center personnel are related the tasks dealing with sustainable development. Other weaknesses are related to reclamations, language skills, shipment process control, customer and stakeholder relations, competence management and unit operations as well as economics. The competencies that can be ensured through university level education are the development of logistics solutions according to the company strategy, competence management and ensuring the customer and stakeholder interests whereas the operative tasks are best assimilated through work-based learning.

AB  - The effects of landscape composition on species and populations have become increasingly important due to large and rapid habitat changes worldwide. In particular, concern is raised for several forest-dwelling species such as capercaillie and black grouse, because their habitats are continuously changing and deteriorating from human development. Conservation of these species is linked to sustainable forest management that seeks to benefit multiple species, which demands knowledge about demographic rates in relation to forest composition and structure. We related the spatial variation in adult density and chick production of capercaillie and black grouse to landscape characteristics from 13 areas within the boreal forest of Norway. Linear mixed effects models showed that black grouse and capercaillie had similar associations to landscape characteristics. Adult density of both species was positively related to the proportion of old forest (> 80 years), but only if the area had large proportions of mid to high productive forests. Chick production was negatively related to the proportion of old forest, but positively to habitat diversity and more so for black grouse compared to capercaillie. However, the result for chick production suggest that other forest types also are important, and that forest grouse needs a variety of habitats during their life history stages. Management that seeks to simultaneously conserve populations of black grouse and capercaillie needs to ensure a matrix of various forest types. A special focus must be on the critical life history of local populations to successfully preserve viable populations, for black grouse and capercaillie this implies protection of old and mid to high productive forest while keeping a heterogeneous landscape.

AB  - Several methods to reconstruct past land cover are available which can be roughly divided into ap-proaches based on pollen data and approaches based on (estimates of) historical human population. In this study, the REVEALS model and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) are applied to pollen sequences obtained from multiple alluvial floodplains located in the sandy and loamy regions of northeastern Belgium, thereby obtaining the first regional (semi-)quantitative estimates of Holocene landscape openness for this area. These estimates are subsequently compared to the two most widely -used scenarios for anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC): KK10 and HYDE. In contrast with the two population-based ALCC scenarios, the pollen-based reconstructions are well in agreement and indicate considerable variability in past land cover, not only between the two regions but even between the individual catchments. This agreement implies that NMDS could serve as an alternative approach to provide insight in large amounts of pollen data in case not all required model parameters are available to run the REVEALS model. Moreover, NMDS can provide a better understanding of which taxa are related to a particular type of landscape. Taking into account such insights in the interpretation of the REVEALS model output might help to pinpoint the onset of significant human impact on the landscape more precisely. Given that alluvial sites often experienced early anthropogenic impact, including pollen data obtained from alluvial sites could not only improve the spatial coverage and accuracy of current pollen-based land cover reconstructions but could also improve our under-standing of human transformation of the landscape, which can in turn contribute to an improvement of the ALCC scenarios.

AB  - Mitigation measures, especially municipal energy infrastructure transformation, have been the focus of Sweden's climate change responses. Recently, adaptation measures have grown in priority and planners are challenged to integrate mitigation and adaptation. In our study, we observe how synergies and conflicts in adaptation, mitigation, and other social and economic dimensions of spatial planning are grappled with in municipalities. We draw primarily from interviews with municipal planners and regional agencies as well as a review of policy documents. Our conclusion is that municipalities could be assisted in their climate change planning by stronger regional and national involvement.

AB  - The Arctic is one of the few corners of the Earth where the unique nature has been preserved almost in its original form as well as the traditional way of life of the indigenous people. Therefore, the Arctic region has attracted an increasing number of tourists in recent years. The Arctic territory of Russia contains a significant potential for the development of Arctic tourism. This article is devoted to the study of tourist potential of the Russian Arctic and identification of the opportunities and constraints of such development. It also presents an analysis of the main competitors of Russia in the field of Arctic tourism (Norway, Finland and Sweden), as well as the formats of their international cooperation in its development in conjunction with the preservation of the fragile ecosystem of the Arctic and sustainable development of the region. The research shows that development of Arctic tourism in Russia is complicated due to lack of infrastructure, undeveloped logistics as well as the high cost of the Arctic tourism product. The simplification of the visa regime may significantly increase the flow of foreign tourists.

AB  - Sustainable tourism has achieved the status of being the superior goal in Norwegian government tourism policy, and is attaining much attention in the international scientific and political discourse on tourism. However, have policies on sustainable tourism and related concepts actually managed to make tourism more sustainable? This article seeks to address this question by first presenting the history of sustainable tourism and related concepts, and specifically analyzing how the triple bottom line approach has influenced the prevailing understanding of the concept of sustainable tourism. The article concludes by claiming that prevailing EU as well as Norwegian national policies aiming to make tourism more sustainable most likely will result in "sustaining tourism" more than actually making tourism more sustainable. The article uses Norway-the "home of the Brundtland report"-as an illustrative case for the discussion.

AB  - In western Europe, the majority of wild goose populations have increased exponentially over the last decades. Such increase is the source of many socio-ecological conflicts. The need for coordinated management actions to handle the goose-related conflicts at the European scale has led to the establishment of a specific European Goose Management Platform (EGMP) under the auspices of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). The northwest/south-west (NW/SW) European population of greylag goose Anser anser has been considered as a priority concern, and an AEWA international single species management plan has been recently adopted. Because of the complex structure of the greylag goose population (e.g. spatial differences in migration strategies), and management (e.g. different hunting schemes among the range states), delineation of management units (MUs) based on goose movement characteristics was deemed necessary to further implement effective management actions. Based on neckband marking in various breeding regions and subsequent resighting locations, we conducted spatio-temporal analysis based on kernel methods to infer spatio-temporal and migratory movements of greylag geese in the NW/SW European flyway. The results highlight the existence of contrasted migratory behaviour, dispersal patterns and phenology within the flyway. From these results three international management units could be delineated. The first MU would include migratory birds from Norway. Birds from breeding grounds in Sweden and Denmark would represent the second MU. Finally, a third central MU was delineated, including primarily breeding birds from the Netherlands and northwestern Germany, which do not show migratory behaviour at the flyway scale. The delineation of these MUs has to be considered within an adaptive process, and future studies will enable a refinement of the definition of such units in order to continuously improve the efficiency of management plans.

AB  - The European network CRAYNET "European crayfish as keystone species-linking science, management and economics with sustainable environmental quality" emphasises knowledge-based management strategies. The CRAYNET meetings concentrate on certain topics: monitoring in conservation and management of natives; interaction between natives and aliens; control of aliens; habitat restoration; reintroduction and restocking; legislation; education. The Irish meeting (Kilkenny, 2003) "The endangered native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes: bioindicator and heritage species" initiated debates about (1) what is a bioindicator, a flagship species or a heritage species?; (2) the problem of species complexes and the need to clarify and resolve taxonomy before management; and (3) what is meant by biodiversity in the context of European crayfish? The Norwegian meeting (Halden, 2003) "European native, crayfish with a special focus on Astacus astacus: linking socioeconomics and conservation " involved roundtables about (1) threats to indigenous population of crayfish at a landscape level; (2) exploitation, conservation, legislation; (3) reintroduction of indigenous crayfish, habitat restoration and monitoring; and (4) the urgent need for joint research about pathology. The present meeting (Innsbruck, 2004) "European native crayfish in relation to land-use and habitat deterioration with a special focus on Austropotamobius torrentim" aims to identify the species protection programs, to examine if legislation is working well in protecting vulnerable species, the state of advances about conservation genetics and how to make progress in education of the public. A permanent connection between the 12 core members provides opportunities to check the needed lines of research, to prepare recommendations, and to gather information for an atlas on the distribution of crayfish species in Europe as well as to prepare leaflets for the public.

AB  - Sustainable city planning requires detailed information on spatial temperature variations. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is known to differ substantially from air tem-perature (AT) causing misinterpretations of the ambient conditions. We demonstrate a reliable and cost-efficient method for AT modelling in urban environments using open data and few temperature observations. The study area is the city of Turku SW Finland, where we have a dense in situ AT observation network of 64 Onset Hobo temperature loggers as a reference. Landsat 8 thermal data from different seasons were used to extract pixel-based LST by employing MODIS and ASTER emissivity libraries and CORINE land cover classification. The LSTs were analysed against the in situ AT first with the correlation analysis. Except for December, the Pearson's correlation coefficients were statistically significant (0.449-0.654, p <= 0.001). Seasonally adjusted linear regression models were applied to predict spatially continuous air temperatures (AT(p)) based on the extracted LST. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict urban ATs reliably - within ca. half-a-degree accuracy (MAE 0.36-0.62 degrees C). The prediction works best in spring, summer and autumn. It improves the capacity to produce reliable high spatial resolution AT information even if in situ observations are sparse.

AB  - Heritage and historical buildings often face climate vulnerabilities, decay of technical performance and energy inefficiency that threaten their use and consequently their long-term preservation. Due to urban densification and escalating energy consumption, addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to protect, rehabilitate and keeping in use historical buildings in cities and utilizing renewable energy sources like solar energy should have a pivotal role towards sustainable cities and communities. However, integrating solar technology into historical buildings faces unique challenges mainly because of the significance, non-standard construction methods adopted, and the valuable original materials. Norway, with its Climate Action Plan and a substantial portion of cultural historic buildings in its building stock, aims to significantly reduce emissions and is seeking for novel solutions. This paper discusses challenges and barriers associated with adoption of solar energy in high-sensitive built environment in Norway, through a scoping review. The results outline conservation criteria as challenges, which include viability, feasibility, integration, reversibility, compatibility, reliability and safety, non-invasiveness, and acceptability. Additionally, the review identifies barriers such as economic, geographic, technical, conservative, legislative, and social factors. Initially, the frequency with which these challenges and barriers appear in academic papers is examined. Subsequently, the interconnections between these challenges and barriers are explored to assess their specific impacts within the Norwegian context. Recognizing these challenges and understanding their interconnection can represent the strength of the relationship between them and can allow to identify potential solutions and strategies to support stakeholders, experts, or public authorities for successfully implementation and integration of solar energy systems in high-sensitive built environments in the future.

AB  - Deep-sea mining (DSM) may become a significant stressor on the marine environment. The DSM industry should demonstrate transparently its commitment to preventing serious harm to the environment by complying with legal requirements, using environmental good practice, and minimizing environmental impacts. Here existing environmental management approaches relevant to DSM that can be used to improve performance are identified and detailed. DSM is still predominantly in the planning stage and will face some unique challenges but there is considerable environmental management experience in existing related industries. International good practice has been suggested for DSM by bodies such as the Pacific Community and the International Marine Minerals Society. The inherent uncertainty in DSM presents challenges, but it can be addressed by collection of environmental information, area-based/spatial management, the precautionary approach and adaptive management. Tools exist for regional and strategic management, which have already begun to be introduced by the International Seabed Authority, for example in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Project specific environmental management, through environmental impact assessment, baseline assessment, monitoring, mitigation and environmental management planning, will be critical to identify and reduce potential impacts. In addition, extractive companies' internal management may be optimised to improve performance by emphasising sustainability at a high level in the company, improving transparency and reporting and introducing environmental management systems. The DSM industry and its regulators have the potential to select and optimize recognised and documented effective practices and adapt them, greatly improving the environmental performance of this new industry.

AB  - Climate change is often considered as a looming apocalypse in the media and its impacts on the cryosphere are increasingly visible in the Arctic region. This apocalyptic future of the Arctic relates to a set of narratives associated with the Anthropocene, wherein snowy landscapes, glaciers and polar bears have disappeared. This has led to a trend called last chance tourism, which has become an evolving economic opportunity for tourism operators and local communities. In this conceptual article we propose an alternative vision for Arctic tourism development referred to as "post-Arctic tourism". In order to illustrate the idea, we utilize Finnish Lapland (Arctic Finland) as an example based on existing literature. It is argued that post-Arctic tourism may be based on so-called dark tourism practices if the used and circulated hegemonic representations of the Arctic remain locked in cryospheric- and traditional winter-based imaginaries. This scenario is supported by a social spatialization process called "Arctification", associated with active attempts to maintain the cryospheric gaze. It is therefore critical for tourism businesses, regions and tourism-dependent communities to rethink and re-invent their Arctic narratives, through "de-Arctification" strategies, allowing for a plurality of tomorrows and for Arctic tourism to become more sustainable and ethical.

T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - The article describes an on-going struggle between local planning authorities, regional fishery authorities and environmental authorities over the management of the Norwegian coastal zone. Particular reference is made to a recent planning project ill Nordland County where Is peripheral communes with weak planning traditions joined forces to produce structure plans for their coastal areas. Concepts of rationality and power are used as points of departure for an interpretation of the actions of the parties involved. The discursively rational nature of the planning project. embodying principles of consensus building, social integration and personal growth, is contrasted to the strictly instrumental behaviour of regional fishery and environmental authorities. The article also relates conflicts between communes and regional sector authorities to the power structure of the field of coastal management and the habitus of the different institutional actors. The actions of the fishery authorities are seen as a defence of their monopoly of the production of ideology in marine management, while the actions of the communes are interpreted as a bid by the periphery for greater control over local resources.

AB  - The current variability in weather and climate is posing a challenge for transport infrastructure. However, during the past decade the need to adapt to a changing climate has attracted increasing attention. This paper summarises a case study on the future vulnerability to climate change of the Swedish railway transport system and its adaptive capacity. The combination of a long time horizon in planning and an expected increasing demand for rail traffic raises many questions regarding how adaptation to climate change can be accounted for in future planning, design and management of railways. The case study was essentially based on interviews with key personnel within the Swedish Rail Administration. Views on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change were documented, and the need for improved methods to assess the vulnerability and adaptive capacity related to climate change for the Swedish railways was addressed. The conclusions of the paper are addressed to the European railway context at large. Firstly, systematic mapping of current climate vulnerabilities and their consequences is important in order to guide the implementation of adaptation measures. Secondly, climate change should be considered in the early stages of planning and included in risk and vulnerability assessments. In assessing future conditions with the aim of prioritising adaptation measures, current methodologies should be complemented with more future-orientated tools. When designing adaptation measures, the effects of potential goal conflicts should also be assessed, in order to avoid the implementation of counter-productive measures. The possibility of creating synergies with climate mitigation goals and other environmental goals should also be investigated.

AB  - Reclaiming abandoned and unmaintained roads, built originally for forestry and mineral extraction, is an important part of ecological restoration, because the roads running through natural habitats cause fragmentation. The roads can be reclaimed in a passive way by blocking access to the road, but successful seedling recruitment may require additional management due to the physical constraints present at the road. We established a full factorial study to compare the effects of three road reclaiming measures, namely ripping, creation of safe sites by adding mulch and pine seed addition, on soil processes, recovery of understorey vegetation and seedling recruitment in three conservation areas in eastern Finland. We surveyed soil organic matter, frequency and cover of plant functional types, litter and mineral soil, and number of tree seedlings. The soil organic matter was, on average, 1.3-fold in the 50-cm-deep ripping treatment relative to unripped and 20-cm-deep ripping treatments. The germination and survival of deciduous seedlings and grass establishment were promoted by adding mulch. The addition of pine seeds counteracted the seed limitation and enhanced the regeneration of trees. The treatment combination consisting of ripping, adding mulch and pine seed addition enhanced the vegetation succession and tree-seedling recruitment most: the cover of grasses, herbs and ericaceous dwarf shrubs was 1.3-7.6-fold and the number of coniferous tree seedlings was 3.4-7.1-fold relative to the other treatment combinations. Differences between short-term (1-3 years) and longer-term (6 years) results indicate the need for a sufficient observation period in road reclamation studies.

AB  - Aquatic products fulfill the protein needs of people and play an important role in food safety. And aquaculture is prized for its high productivity, sustainability and environmental friendliness. Considering the importance of aquaculture, the legal risks exposed during the aquaculture process deserve attention in order to prevent them from hindering the development of the aquaculture industry. Through online research, literature analysis and practical communication, it is shown that the current legal risks with commonalities include land use violations, lack of legal documents, failure to meet tailing water criteria, unquarantined fry and misuse of prohibited agricultural pharmaceuticals through online research, literature analysis and practical communication. By analyzing the reasons for the formation of legal risks and combining the experiences in sustainable development of three major aquaculture countries, which are Korea, Norway and Chile, this paper provides targeted preventive remedies and suggestions for aquaculture operators, administrative parties, legislators and other parties on legal risks. It includes promoting the improvement of the rule of law in multiple aspects, clarifying the positioning of the aquatic breeding certificates, improving and propagating the standards for wastewater discharge, increasing the self-sufficiency rate of aquatic fry and fingerlings, as well as making use of the synergy of soft law and hard law.

AB  - Agriculture remains one of the dominant activities in rural areas across the European Union (EU), not least in respect of land use and its impact on landscapes. The Agenda 2000 reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced rural development as an integrated part of agricultural policy. The present study focuses on the second pillar of CAP. Multifunctional farming, more than any other rural activity, has a role to play in integrating the natural environment with the cultural landscape and socio-economic development. The question of how multifunctional agriculture can facilitate sustainable rural development is addressed in terms of mechanisms and inherent possibilities. Results from a case study in Ostergotland in Sweden are discussed in relation to five other European case studies. Some main findings are that Pillar 2 has made it possible for rural inhabitants to continue living in rural areas and that the policies are effective in identifying and supporting new opportunities for farm diversification. The traditional agricultural landscape can be seen as a key component in various diversification activities in rural areas, contributing to economic as well as social and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Multiple natural and anthropogenic factors affect urban water chemistry. However, little is known about the abundance or temporal variation of major ions in urban runoff. This study explores the spatio-temporal variation of major dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3, and SO4) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in cold climate urban stormwater. Three watersheds with varying degrees of urban land use intensity and imperviousness (from 36% to 66%) in Helsinki, Finland, were continuously monitored for 5 years using an automated sampling procedure to obtain stormwater discharge and ion concentrations and, thus, loadings. High-resolution datasets, including long-term continuous discharge, both measured and simulated (using Storm Water Management Model), and automatic water quality sampling enabled the accurate calculation of loads of ions and TDS. Water quality was related to explanatory watershed characteristics (e.g., watershed physiography and sampling time) using hierarchical clustering, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical partitioning methods. Urban land use contributed to increased ion concentrations and loads year-round. This study highlights how stormwater ion concentrations are elevated across seasons, indicating chronic pollution phenomena. The greatest loads occurred during summer (except for Na and Cl), while the highest variation in loads was observed in autumn. Significant clusters among ions were found in the hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting similar temporal patterns and sources for the ions in each cluster. The importance of land use was evident, though in the most urbanized watershed, concentrations were not linked to any of the investigated watershed characteristics. Based on our results, only Na and Cl are manageable by alternative winter road antiskid practices, whereas other ions resulted from diffuse pollution sources, being therefore more difficult to control. Finally, this study contributes to an increased understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of ions in stormwater and highlights the need for consistent time series data for ion monitoring under cold climatic conditions in order to enable reliable estimates of their loads to adjacent water bodies. Finally, year-round stormwater treatment is highly recommended.

AB  - 1. Afforestation of agricultural land has become an important issue in Europe during the past two decades. In particular, broadleaf plantations have been promoted as multifunctional forests for biodiversity, timber production and recreation. The aim of this study was to analyse how the colonization of ground-layer plants in recently planted woodlands is affected by stand age, spatial isolation, former land-use type and canopy species.
   2. Colonization was studied in 50 plantations of pedunculate oak Quercus robur and 16 plantations of European sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus on former arable land and open pastures in the Torup-Skabersjo area of southern Sweden. Twelve oak plantations and 10 sycamore plantations on ancient woodland sites were used as reference areas.
   3. Woodland species richness increased continuously with stand age in plantations contiguous with ancient woodland. The oldest plantations (70-80 years) approached the species richness of ancient oak woodland. Species richness decreased with increasing distance from ancient woodlands, and there was no significant increase in species richness between stands aged 20 and 80 years in isolated plantations. Most species that regularly colonized isolated plantations had adhesive seeds or small, wind-dispersed diaspores.
   4. Ordination analysis showed clear differentiation between former land-use categories and spatiotemporal stand categories (recently isolated, recently contiguous and ancient). No consistent differences were found in vegetation patterns in oak and sycamore stands. Woodland species richness was similar on former arable land and open pastures. Pasture plantations were characterized by the presence of more acid-tolerant species, whereas the frequency of some acid-sensitive species was higher on former fields. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that new woodland should build out from cores of ancient woodland for optimal ground vegetation development. A species-rich ground vegetation can be achieved by spontaneous colonization within 70-80 years when plantations are contiguous with ancient woods. Formerly cultivated soils are generally well suited for understorey plants of forests on base-rich loamy soils as long as closed canopy conditions are maintained. However, many typical forest species are not able to disperse across open fields and their establishment in isolated stands will require sowing or planting.

AB  - Arable nitrogen emissions contribute to serious water-quality problems around the globe. To reduce pollution of the Baltic Sea, Sweden has implemented a comprehensive scheme of nitrogen abatement instruments; a uniform nitrogen fertilizer tax, green payments (subsidies), and land-use regulations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative cost-efficiency of the scheme and to analyze the implications of agricultural policy for the least-cost solution. Due to the expanse and heterogeneity of the study area, a spatially distributed nonlinear mathematical programming model, which linked changes in agricultural production practices on crop farms in Southern Sweden to coastal nitrogen load, was developed. Spatial variation in physical parameters, production costs, and the fate and transport of nitrogen were accounted for. Interactions between agricultural and nitrogen policy were shown to occur. Least-cost abatement measures changed radically with and without agricultural policy. Nitrogen policy can be construed as simply correcting for pollution induced by agricultural policy.

AB  - Habitat quality affects demography, population genetics, space use and phenotypic characteristics of mammals. However, little is known about the effects of habitat quality, fragmentation and/or food abundance, on host-parasite interactions. Here we present a first study on the relationships between the abundance of the dominant gastrointestinal helminth, Trypanoxyuris (Rodentoxyuris) sciuri, infecting the Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and three environmental factors: habitat type (mountain conifer forests vs. lowland mixed deciduous forests), fragmentation (fragmented woodlands vs. continuous forests) and food availability. Abundance of T. (R.) sciuri increased in fragmented woods. Furthermore, in mountain conifer forests, squirrels were more heavily infected after a poor Norway spruce seed crop than in years with medium or high seed production, indicating that squirrels are less capable of reducing parasite load when food availability is low. Hence, we suggest that T. (R.) sciuri abundance in red squirrels may be determined mainly by changes in host susceptibility induced by higher stress levels and/or poorer nutritional status, while in fragments, reduced genetic diversity may also increase host susceptibility to parasite infection. Although our data do not shed light on the mechanisms generating the observed patterns, results from other field studies highlighted the effect of stress and nutritional status on parasite infection, thus suggesting their implication in the changes in the abundance of T. (R.) sciuri.

AB  - Urban planning typically involves multiple actors and stakeholders with conflicting opinions and diverging preferences. The proposed development plans and actions greatly affect the quality of life of the local community at different spatial scales and time horizons. Consequently, it is important for decision-makers to understand and analyse the conflicting needs and priorities of the local community. This paper presents a decision analytic framework for evaluating stakeholder conflicts in urban planning. First, the stakeholders state their preferences regarding the actions in terms of a set of criteria and estimate the weight of each criterion. Then, a conflict index and overall value for each action is calculated. Next, a set of Pareto efficient portfolios of actions are generated by solving an optimization problem with different levels of conflict as a resource constraint. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the actions is performed. The framework is demonstrated using real-world survey data collected in the municipality of Upplands Vasby, Sweden.

AB  - There are concerns that deadwood supply (both snags and downed wood) may become a limiting resource for biodiversity conservation as the bio-economy develops. Despite this concern, it remains difficult to monitor all elements of biodiversity to ensure that forest management activities are not reducing deadwood below minimum thresholds. As a dynamic resource, deadwood quantity and quality does change throughout forest succession. Simulation modelling represents one approach to integrating this variability and supporting the refinement of forest management guidelines. In this paper, we review important considerations for developing deadwood models that address biodiversity concerns. These include defining initial conditions, estimating deadwood inputs over time, identifying parameters necessary to represent biodiversity, identifying data available to parameterize, calibrate and validate models, and identifying requirements for model validation and documentation. In addition, we consider how deadwood characteristics such as form, size, state of decay, tree species, cause of mortality and position can be treated in models to represent the full range of biodiversity requirements. Lastly, we review examples of stand-alone and study-specific deadwood modelling approaches to provide a road map for development of a robust, temporally dynamic deadwood model that addresses biodiversity and sustainability issues related to biomass harvest for bioenergy.

AB  - Loss of Arctic sea ice owing to climate change is predicted to reduce both genetic diversity and gene flow in ice-dependent species, with potentially negative consequences for their long-term viability. Here, we tested for the population-genetic impacts of reduced sea ice cover on the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) sampled across two decades (1995-2016) from the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, an area that is affected by rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic Barents Sea. We analysed genetic variation at 22 microsatellite loci for 626 polar bears from four sampling areas within the archipelago. Our results revealed a 3-10% loss of genetic diversity across the study period, accompanied by a near 200% increase in genetic differentiation across regions. These effects may best be explained by a decrease in gene flow caused by habitat fragmentation owing to the loss of sea ice coverage, resulting in increased inbreeding of local polar bears within the focal sampling areas in the Svalbard Archipelago. This study illustrates the importance of genetic monitoring for developing adaptive management strategies for polar bears and other ice-dependent species.

AB  - Land degradation with deforestation and loss of biodiversity has been considered one of the most serious environmental problems for developing countries. The lower level of agricultural productivity resulting in the inability to obtain a sufficient level of production in agriculture leads rural communities to exert pressure on forest resources while damaging the ecological services provided by them. Promotion of economic efficiency as well as achieving environmentally sustainable farming practices can help maintain a sustainable agricultural sector while reducing land degradation and pressure on forests in rural communities. In this context this study investigates the relationships between different indicators of agricultural biodiversity (crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro-diversity) and farm level technical efficiency (TE). A survey conducted covering 723 farms in Sri Lanka is used for the analysis. The results show that crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro diversity are positively related with farm level TE. Hence, it is clear that maintaining more diverse farming systems is crucial to reducing farm level inefficiency and thereby improving the welfare of rural households while reducing the pressure on extensive agricultural practices which has increased global deforestation. Such diversity is especially important for subsistence agricultural practices which are still widespread in most Asian countries.

AB  - In this article a "sustainable urban development" programme in Sweden (Delegation for Sustainable Cities, 2008-2012) is analysed, with a particular focus on the social dimension, and in the light of a commonly held assumption of a general shift in politics over time "from government to governance". However, on closer examination the programme comes out as something quite different. Taking "policy community" as our conceptual point of departure the article first portrays how post-war housing policy in Sweden was implemented jointly by a potent central government, strong local governments, public housing companies and major interest organisations. The Delegation for Sustainable Cities, on the other hand, was launched as "a national arena for sustainable urban development" with a multifaceted mission, including the production and dissemination of knowledge through best practice; the promotion of multi-actor dialogue and coordination; and the use and export of green technology. Implementation of the programme was delegated to a small number of projects in selected housing districts. In relation to the narrative "from government to governance", the Delegation for Sustainable Cities rather indicates the opposite, i.e. government steering by a combination of structural non-intervention, rhetorical flair and selective fragmentation into project-bound issue networks. The sustainability discourse thus turned out to be a perfect umbrella for the fragmented implementation structure of the Delegation for Sustainable Cities programme. Instead of a tight, multi-level, national governance structure (policy community) we thus have a case of governing at some distance by a combination of what in recent literature have been labelled the Regulatory State and the Networked Polity.

AB  - This article presents a new way of understanding local land-use conflicts, also called NIMBY, developing from justification theory and literature from the sociology of engagements. The article builds on the multiple systems of valuation used by people to perceive local land-use cases as conflicts, following the pragmatic sociology of Boltanski and Thevenot. The conflicts are shown to be not only about conflicting interests of the residents, but also about broader conflicting systems of valuation. Empirically, land-use cases in Helsinki, Finland are analysed to show the variety of argumentation used by residents opposing land-use. Over 500 dispute letters are analysed, the vast majority of which base their argumentation on common good. About 40% also use argumentation based on individual interest. Argumentation based on close familiar affinities is rare but existing, which might be because of the type of data used in the article. The framework used allows for the non-moralizing use of the concept NIMBY when describing the conflicts.

AB  - Northern coastal regions are facing multiple challenges from accelerating global environmental and socioeconomic changes, such as ecosystem degradation, climate change, intensified resource extraction, land use change and declining populations. Based on interviews with 13 farmers, fishers and aquaculture employees from coastal Nordland, northern Norway, this study demonstrates how the local stakeholders' perceptions of change and experiences of vulnerability are closely linked to their livelihood values and worldviews. What the informants consider a sustainable and meaningful way of coastal living does not coincide with national goals for sustainable, natural resource dependent development of the region. The article demonstrates the importance of attending to local values if policymakers and managers are to ensure successful local mobilisation, reduce vulnerability to ongoing and future processes of change, and ensure legitimacy and consistency in development goals of coastal zone management. Insights from this study are useful for local and regional decision makers with responsibility for natural resource policies and development efforts.

AB  - Forest fragmentation is commonly characterized using indices derived from analyses of classified land cover maps. An alternative is to use data obtained from sampling, such as those from a national forest inventory (NFI). The main objective of the current study is fill knowledge gaps on the performance of sample-based forest fragmentation metrics calculated with different cluster plot designs and under different forest conditions. A set of NFI cluster plot designs, each with different geometric properties, was created from Swedish NFI data. Each member of the set was used to calculate the fragmentation metrics mean patch size (MPS) and perimeter-area ratio (PA). Impacts of plot design parameters on metric estimates and their precision were assessed. Important differences in metric values were observed both within and between regions under different plot design scenarios; within regions, ranges of PA and MPS values were large, and confidence intervals for the minimum and maximum metric values did not overlap. Weighted least squares regression significance testing results suggest that subplot separation distance was an impactful design factor whereas number of subplots and cluster shape were less important. However, cluster plots with more and widely-separated subplots yielded estimates that were more precise (lower relative sampling errors) than smaller, more compact clusters. We suggest that care should be taken when interpreting the physical meaning of the metrics under study.

AB  - For many decades, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNGLOS) has provided the legal framework for the development of regulations for the protection of the oceans and marine resources. Further to that, and in an ever-changing policy and legal landscape, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), with its sub-principles for the protection of the oceans, refers to one of the many United Nations (UN) voluntary initiatives that seeks to provide a framework for responsible business practices across maritime sector. In addition, and as a move to comply with the recent United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS), the ungc has been revised to meet the requirements of SDG 14 for underwater protection and sustainable ocean business conduct. In the wake of such trends, this study explores the context of Norway's governance framework and, in particular, the extent to which this regime has addressed the principles of the United Nations Global Compact for Sustainable Oceans. Framed by a socio-legal methodological approach, it achieves this by reviewing and contrasting Norwegian ocean policy and regulatory structure with ungc principles for sustainable ocean and marine resource use. We conclude that Norwegian ocean policy and legal status indicate positive transitional standards and perspectives for their harmonization with the ungc principles and, consequently, with the requirements of the SDG 14.

AB  - The concept of sustainability has been a part of theory and practice in agriculture for a long time, but the diverse roots of the concept have led to a number of different definitions of sustainable agriculture. This paper provides an overview of the policy development of sustainable agriculture in Finland by examining internal and external discourses of sustainability and the evolution in different dimensions of sustainability. We show that the debate on sustainability within European Union's Common Agricultural Policy and Finnish agri-environmental policy are reflected in attempts to implement and monitor sustainability in agriculture in Finland. However, indicators suggest a largely non-sustainable condition. This has contributed to a shift in policy objectives from sustainable agriculture to sustainable rural development, especially in the EU context. As there are commonly trade-offs between the economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainable development, future developments in sustainable agriculture will inevitably be characterized by continuous redefinitions of problems, paradigm revisions and reassessments of actions already taken.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse Norwegian farmers' perspectives on the meaning of working in agriculture, their attitudes towards various aspects of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) and land use, and their evaluation of different forms of agricultural payments. The paper presents two linked studies, one Likert scale survey and one sub-sample Q-study. The Likert scale survey results show that the respondents identify themselves as producing not only high-quality food, but also public goods such as cultural landscapes and cultural heritage. Income maximisation is less important with respect to the self-identity for the respondents. The sub-sample Q-study identified two distinct perspectives of interest to the discussion about MFA policy. Perspective 1 farmers attach priority to fair income, food production and payment for food production as opposed to payments for public goods and income support. Perspective 2 farmers emphasise the importance of producing cultural landscapes, but have no strong preferences regarding the form of payments. The latter view is predominantly held by part-time farmers. The quality of the local landscape as valued by the local community had no effect on the perspectives farmers held. Our study reveals that fully replacing commodity price support with payments for public good production, or income support, is problematic for a substantial group of farmers, who would find farming to be less meaningful for them.

AB  - Transformative adaptation is described as decisive to mitigating risks and to seizing opportunities from a changing climate, requiring new ways of governing, planning and collaborating, alongside technical innovations. Building municipal capacities for citizen participation in adaptation is important to enabling such transformational changes but remains challenging. By applying capacities distilled from the literature on Urban Transformative Capacity and Participatory Climate Governance in a Swedish municipal case, this study aims to disentangle key limits for, and innovations to strengthen, local capacities for citizen participation in transformative climate adaptation. Interviews with municipal officials, focus groups with citizens, and document analyses were employed to analyse how climate adaptation and citizen participation are governed, and how these policy areas are interacting and could be bridged. The study points at conditions that foremost prevent bridging established policies and practices on adaptation and citizen participation, stemming from the different logics and distribution of responsibility within, and lacking collaboration between, these separated policy areas. The analysis concludes that potential ways to enable citizen participation in adaptation involve: broadening the geographical boundaries of deliberations; redefining the target groups for participation; co-designing participation targets, approaches and evaluation; and developing new ways to analyse and act on the patterns in the citizen inputs received.

AB  - Forests of the world constitute one-third of the total land area and are critical for e.g. carbon balance, biodiversity, water supply and as source for bio-based products. Although the terrain within forest land has a great impact on accessibility, there is a lack of knowledge about the distribution of its variation in slope. The aim was to address that knowledge gap and create a globally consistent dataset of the distribution and area of forest land within different slope classes. A Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis was performed using the open-source QGIS, GDAL and R software. The core of the analysis was a digital elevation model and a forest cover mask, both with a final resolution of 90 m. The total forest area according to the forest mask was 4.15 billion hectares whereof 82 per cent was on slope<15 degrees. The remaining 18 per cent was distributed over the following slope classes, with 6 per cent on a 15-20 degrees slope, 8 per cent on a 20-30 degrees slope and 4 per cent on a slope>30 degrees. Out of the major forestry countries, China had the largest proportion of forest steeper than 15 degrees followed by Chile and India. A sensitivity analysis with 20 m resolution resulted in increased steep areas by 1 per cent point in flat Sweden and by 11 per cent points in steep Austria. In addition to country-specific and aggregated results of slope distribution and forest area, a global raster dataset is also made freely available to cover user-specific areas that are not necessarily demarcated by country borders. Apart from predicting the regional possibilities for different harvesting equipment, which was the original idea behind this study, the results can be used to relate geographical forest variables to slope. The results could also be used in strategic forest fire fighting and large-scale planning of forest conservation and management.

AB  - Continental-scale assessments of 21st century global impacts of climate change on biodiversity have forecasted range contractions for many species. These coarse resolution studies are, however, of limited relevance for projecting risks to biodiversity in mountain systems, where pronounced microclimatic variation could allow species to persist locally, and are ill-suited for assessment of species-specific threat in particular regions. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges, using high-resolution (ca. 100 m) species samples and data expressing four future climate scenarios. Projected habitat loss is greater for species distributed at higher elevations; depending on the climate scenario, we find 36-55% of alpine species, 31-51% of subalpine species and 19-46% of montane species lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070-2100. While our high-resolution analyses consistently indicate marked levels of threat to cold-adapted mountain florae across Europe, they also reveal unequal distribution of this threat across the various mountain ranges. Impacts on florae from regions projected to undergo increased warming accompanied by decreased precipitation, such as the Pyrenees and the Eastern Austrian Alps, will likely be greater than on florae in regions where the increase in temperature is less pronounced and rainfall increases concomitantly, such as in the Norwegian Scandes and the Scottish Highlands. This suggests that change in precipitation, not only warming, plays an important role in determining the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation.

AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in recording landscape change. Monitoring programmes have been established to measure the scope, direction and rate of change, and assess the consequences of changes for multiple interests, such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. The results can provide feedback for multiple sectors and policy domains. Political interests may change over time, but long-term monitoring demands long-term funding. This requires that monitoring programmes remain relevant and cost-efficient. In this paper, we document experiences from 20 years of the Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Agricultural Landscapesthe 3Q Programme'. We explain how data availability and demands for information have changed over time, and how the monitoring programme has been adapted to remain relevant. We also discuss how methods of presentation influence the degree of knowledge transfer to stakeholders, in particular to policy makers.

AB  - Background: Urbanization causes modification, fragmentation and loss of native habitats. Such landscape changes threaten many arboreal and gliding mammals by limiting their movements through treeless parts of a landscape and by making the landscape surrounding suitable habitat patches more inhospitable. Here, we investigate the effects of landscape structure and habitat availability on the home-range use and movement patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) at different spatial and temporal scales. We followed radio-tagged individuals in a partly urbanized study area in Eastern Finland, and analysed how landscape composition and connectivity affected the length and speed of movement bursts, distances moved during one night, and habitat and nest-site use.
   Results: The presence of urban habitat on movement paths increased both movement lengths and speed whereas nightly distances travelled by males decreased with increasing amount of urban habitat within the home range. The probability of switching from the present nest site to another nest site decreased with increasing distance among the nest sites, but whether the nest sites were connected or unconnected by forests did not have a clear effect on nest switching. Flying squirrels preferred to use mature forests for their movements at night.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the proximity to urban habitats modifies animal movements, possibly because animals try to avoid such habitats by moving faster through them. Urbanization at the scale of an entire home range can restrict their movements. Thus, maintaining a large enough amount of mature forests around inhabited landscape fragments will help protect forest specialists in urban landscapes. The effect of forested connections remains unclear, highlighting the difficulty of measuring and preserving connectivity in a species-specific way.

AB  - The intake fraction (iF) has been defined as the integrated incremental intake of a pollutant released from a source category or region summed over all exposed individuals. In this study we evaluated the ifs in the population of Europe for emissions of anthropogenic primary fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) from sources in Europe, with a more detailed analysis of the iF from Finnish sources. Parameters for calculating the ifs include the emission strengths, the predicted atmospheric concentrations, European population data, and the average breathing rate per person. Emissions for the whole of Europe and Finland were based on the inventories of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and the Finnish Regional Emission Scenario (FRES) model, respectively. The atmospheric dispersion of primary PM(2.5) Was computed using the regional-scale dispersion model SILAM. The ifs from Finnish sources were also computed separately for six emission source categories. The ifs corresponding to the primary PM(2.5) emissions from the European countries for the whole population of Europe were generally highest for the densely populated Western European countries, second highest for the Eastern and Southern European countries, and lowest for the Northern European and Baltic countries. For the entire European population, the iF values varied from the lowest value of 0.31 per million for emissions from Cyprus, to the highest value of 4.42 per million for emissions from Belgium. These results depend on the regional distribution of the population and the prevailing long-term meteorological conditions. Regarding Finnish primary PM(2.5) emissions, the iF was highest for traffic emissions (0.68 per million) and lowest for major power plant emissions (0.50 per million). The results provide new information that can be used to find the most cost-efficient emission abatement strategies and policies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research explores and adds to the literature concerning the relationship between spatial structure and travel behaviour; specifically, the relationship between local and regional accessibility to service amenities and the distance of service-related trips. The analysis is based on a unique combination of national travel survey data for Sweden and official register data With detailed, geo-referenced information about the Swedish population and the location of service amenities in 1995 and 2005/2006. The results show that spatial access to service amenities increased in general over the study period, both locally (i.e., within ranges of 1 km and 5 km, respectively, of residential areas) and regionally (within 50 km). Despite increased spatial accessibility, the observed average travel distance also increased. We find strong and differing associations between spatial access to service amenities and travel distance, depending on level of scale. While the association was negative on the local scale (i.e., a numerically large supply of amenities was related to shorter travel distance), it was the opposite and positive, on the regional scale. In terms of implications for policy,, the results imply that land use planning measures to promote local access, and thereby reduce traffic volumes, may per se be insufficient for attaining more sustainable levels of mobility.

AB  - To ensure the sustainable production and consumption of biofuels, an increasing body of scientific literature has become available in recent years focusing on the environmental impacts of biofuels. Whilst the climate change mitigation is perhaps the primary driver behind the promotion of biofuels, climate change is not the only crucial impact associated with biofuel production and consumption systems. This study aims. at analysing the extent of the dominant focus on climate impacts in Swedish research applying environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools to investigate the environmental impacts of biofuels, and why this may exist A systematic literature review of Swedish research applying ESA tools in the study of transportation biofuels between 2000 and 2015 was conducted; identifying 64 studies. The results indicate that studies using life cycle assessment include a range of impact categories in addition to climate impacts, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. However, when also considering environmental footprints (i.e., carbon and water footprints) and material flow analyses, the dominance of carbon footprints leads to an overly dominant focus on climate impacts at the expense of other impact categories. The consideration of environmental impacts other than those related to climate impacts is discussed in terms of the influence of the dominant science-policy framework in Sweden and study dependent variables, such as data uncertainty and methodological limitations. Whilst biofuel production is inextricably linked to climate policy, the environmental impacts of Swedish biofuel production and consumption should also consider the broader context of the Swedish National Environmental Objectives.

AB  - Rapid, but contrasting, changes in the extent of erect thicket-forming shrubs is presently seen in the Arctic, either resulting from a warmer climate (increasing extent) or intensified herbivory (decreasing extent). We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra.

AB  - 1. In response to reported declines in crucian carp Carassius carassius across Europe, studies of the status and population biology of the species in England led to Biodiversity Action Plan priority designation in the eastern county of Norfolk. 2. In light of new data on crucian carp populations in eastern England (counties of Essex, Hertfordshire and Norfolk), a comprehensive review of available information throughout its native and introduced European range was undertaken to assess the growth and reproduction at a broader scale, thus contributing to conservation and management strategies at a country scale in the UK. 3. For all populations, mean sex ratio was 1:1, back-calculated total length (TL) ranged from 19 to 334mm, and maximum age was 13years. Growth and body condition varied greatly across Europe. Growth trajectories in England, Russia and Poland were significantly faster than in Finland. Within England, growth index was lower in Hertfordshire than in Essex and Norfolk, and Fulton condition (plumpness) index was higher in Essex than in Norfolk. 4. Reproductive traits varied greatly both in males and females, with age at maturity ranging from 1.5 to 5years, and with the shortest life spans observed in England. Length at maturity was usually at a lower TL in males than females (except in Essex populations). Female age at maturity decreased significantly with juvenile growth, which was defined as TL at age 2, the age above which females in most populations achieved maturity. 5. Predicted temperature rise (i.e. under a climate change scenario) may benefit crucian carp growth, as predicted for related competitive invaders (e.g. goldfish Carassius auratus). From a conservation perspective, suggested management strategies include reducing populations of non-native fishes, implementing measures of habitat restoration and re-stocking rehabilitated ponds from source areas', i.e. those containing crucian carp populations in good status.

AB  - Yearly and daily surface runoff and soil loss simulated by the WEPP Hillslope model v. 2002.7 were compared with measurements from two different soil erosion plot sites in southeastern Norway. The soil at Bjornebekk (Bj) was a levelled silty clay loam (2% organic matter) and the soil at Syverud (Sy) was a loam (5% organic matter). The plots at Bj were 21 m long and 8 m wide, while the plots at Sy were 30 m long and 7 m wide. Slope at both sites was 13%. Four management systems for grain production were used: autumn ploughing (AP), winter crop rotation (WCR), autumn harrowing (AH) and spring ploughing (SP). Hydraulic conductivity and soil erosion parameters were determined using WEPP-recommended equations based on measured soil parameters. In general, the WEPP Hillslope model simulated fewer runoff events than measured for all management systems during 1990-1998. Runoff events in winter were seldom predicted and small events (<5 mm) were mostly missed. To use the WEPP Hillslope model on Norwegian soils, where major soil loss events from arable land occur during late autumn, winter and early spring, improvements in winter hydrology calculations are needed. In particular calculations of soil frost development and infiltration into frozen soil need to be improved. The WEPP-recommended soil erosion parameter equations were unsuitable for these two Norwegian soils, especially for levelled soil. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat use by cervids can have large effects on vegetation. Therefore, factors influencing habitat use are pertinent to ecology, nature conservation as well as management of forests and hunting. The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing habitat use by red and roe deer, Cervus elaphus and Capreolus capreolus, in the Luneburger Heide, Germany. We used faecal pellet counts as an indicator of habitat use and applied generalized linear models to conclude that habitat use by both cervids was largely explained by the availability of food plants. In particular, the occurrence of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and deciduous trees such as beeches Fagus sylvatica were of major importance. Nonetheless, red and roe deer showed preferences for different plant species, but for both deer, the presence of large trees and conifers, with exception of young Norway spruce Picea abies providing shelter for roe deer, was less attractive. Furthermore, the proximity of mineral licks was important for both cervids. Relative to roe deer, red deer showed a stronger avoidance of well-used paths. Surprisingly, landscape features such as distance to settlements and elevated hunting standshad no significant effect. Our study demonstrates similarities and differences in habitat use of two important herbivores of the Northern temperate forests. We propose that managers establish 'decoy' sites for deer: areas with a high proportion of ground vegetation and young trees of lower forestry value. This will serve to divert deer from valuable trees and thereby enhance biodiversity. These open stands could be interspersed with dense islands of young coniferous trees to offer shelter and should be distant to frequently used pathways. Mineral licks may help enhance use of these sites. Providing an attractive resource for both species of cervids is the best way to manage large herbivores in economically valuable forests.

AB  - In recent years, a growing interest from consumers to know the origins and contents of foods has put alternative choices, such as organic foods and dietary changes, on the agenda. Dietary choices are important to address, as many studies find that activities related to food production account for nearly 20-30% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nonetheless, while GHG emissions are important, often other environmental impact categories are not considered in the assessment of the sustainability of different foods, diets and choices. This study aims to quantify the implications of dietary choices for Swedish food consumption on a broad range of environmental impact categories using life cycle assessment to provide insight into the impacts, and potential tradeoffs, associated with certain food products and dietary choices. Scenarios are used to assess the implications of diets with reduced meat, increased Swedish food consumption, increased organic foods, vegan and semi-vegetarian diets. The results indicate that tradeoffs could be possible with certain dietary choices. Increasing Swedish food production and consumption may lead to lower impacts for all impact categories by reducing imports, although limitations in growing season and availability of foods in Sweden allows only for minor increases. The results also indicate that large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are possible by reducing meat consumption, i.e., by halving meat consumption and through vegan and vegetarian diets. Nonetheless, an increase in vegetable, legume and fruit products may lead to a potential increase in human and ecosystem toxicity. Diets based on nutritional guidelines, show reductions in all impact categories, as these guidelines call for an increase in vegetables and fruits and a reduction in meat consumption. An increase in organic foods showed no significant change in climate impact, although toxicity potential was reduced significantly. Increasing consumption of organic foods may also lead to a reduction in biodiversity damage potential, and if all food is produced organically, it risks increasing eutrophication and land use.

AB  - BackgroundEmergency Medicine (EM) is an independent specialty in all five Nordic countries. This study aims to evaluate the structure of post-graduate EM training in the area.MethodsA leading hospital or hospitals in EM training in each country were identified. An e-survey was sent to each hospital to gather data on patient volume and physician staffing, curriculum, trainee supervision, and monitoring of progression in training.ResultsData were collected from one center in Iceland and Norway, two in Finland and Sweden, and four centers in Denmark. The data from each country in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, were pooled to represent that country. The percentage of consultants with EM specialist recognition ranged from 49-100% of all consultants working in the participating departments. The number of patients seen annually per each full time EM consultant was almost three times higher in Finland than in Sweden. In Iceland, Denmark, and Sweden a consultant was present 24/7 in the ED but not in all centers in the other countries. The level of trainee autonomy in clinical practice varied between countries. Requirements for completing standardized courses, completing final exams, scientific and quality improvement projects, and evaluation of trainee progression, varied between the countries.ConclusionsAll Nordic countries have established EM training programs. Despite cultural similarities, there are significant differences in how the EM training is structured between the countries. Writing and implementing a standardized training curriculum and assessment system for EM training in the Nordic countries should be considered.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the current level of awareness, implementation and need for knowledge of game-oriented forest management (GOFM) among forest owners and professionals. This information is necessary to understand the grounds for improving awareness and implementation of new forest management guidelines and to evaluate suitable policy instruments for the future. The study joins the body of research on innovation diffusion and institutional adaptation, in regard to new forest management methods. Our results from Finland indicated that a high proportion of forest owners have not adopted GOFM, despite the information provided. A wider implementation of the method might require other knowledge dissemination methods, such as providing tangible examples and peer learning to forest owners. The role of forest professionals as change agents was seen to be important for the generalization of GOFM among forest owners and inside institutions. The observed level of awareness of GOFM and its implementation among forest owners, and the engagement of professionals reflects a situation where the informing process is ongoing, and where the forestry advisors need tools to engage forest owners more effectively. At the same time, it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of the voluntary based approach of GOFM. In this study, the double sampling design removed volunteer bias and increased the reliability of the results.

AB  - Forests and their management are changing due to new policies, land abandonment, decisions of forest owners, tenure and climate change. The importance of deadwood as species habitat in combination with increasing concerns for biodiversity is now broadly recognized and studies of deadwood are conducted in protection areas, plantations as well as natural commercial forests. One promising adaptive forest management alternative is plenter forest management. Here we attempt to answer questions, how stand structure changes after converting even-aged age-class forests into uneven-aged plenter forests and how the management transition affects dead-wood pools, using an established pairwise comparison study in spruce-fir-beech forests in Austria. While live tree and branch volume were statistically different between the two treatments, deadwood volume and decay classes were comparable. Stands transforming into plenter forests exhibited clear unimodal stem density distribution in both 2009/10 and 2022, which differed from stands within a plenter equilibrium.. This indicates that structural transitions from age-class forests to plenter forests is a slow continuous process, requiring more than 60 years. Our results further suggest that plenter forests do not have higher deadwood stocks, despite considered "close-to -nature" management in some studies. Lower deadwood stocks in plenter forests (not significantly different to forests transitioning to plenter forests) may be compensated by plenter forests exhibiting a more diverse range of deadwood components, with possible positive overall effects on habitat value for species depending on dead-wood of various decay classes.

AB  - Marine management plans over the world express high expectations to the development of offshore wind energy. This would obviously contribute to renewable energy production, but potential conflicts with other usages of the marine landscape, as well as conservation interests, are evident. The present study synthesizes the current state of understanding on the effects of offshore wind farms on marine wildlife, in order to identify general versus local conclusions in published studies. The results were translated into a generalized impact assessment for coastal waters in Sweden, which covers a range of salinity conditions from marine to nearly fresh waters. Hence, the conclusions are potentially applicable to marine planning situations in various aquatic ecosystems. The assessment considered impact with respect to temporal and spatial extent of the pressure, effect within each ecosystem component, and level of certainty. Research on the environmental effects of offshore wind farms has gone through a rapid maturation and learning process, with the bulk of knowledge being developed within the past ten years. The studies showed a high level of consensus with respect to the construction phase, indicating that potential impacts on marine life should be carefully considered in marine spatial planning. Potential impacts during the operational phase were more locally variable, and could be either negative or positive depending on biological conditions as well as prevailing management goals. There was paucity in studies on cumulative impacts and long-term effects on the food web, as well as on combined effects with other human activities, such as the fisheries. These aspects remain key open issues for a sustainable marine spatial planning.

AB  - There is potential to increase the economic returns in many fisheries by improving fisheries management. In this article, maximum and estimated current resource rents are analyzed using a standardized methodology for five case studies of fisheries with different management regimes: individual quotas (Norway), individual transferable quotas (Iceland), co-management (Denmark), vessel catch limits (Sweden), and tradable days-at-sea regulation (Faroe Islands). The Danish co-managed fishery had the highest estimated current rent, corresponding to 51% of landing value compared to a maximum rent of 62%. The Danish case was followed by the Icelandic ITQ fisher (estimated current 30%, maximum 66%), Faroese tradable days-at-sea (current 28%, maximum 55%), Swedish vessel catch limits (current 3%, maximum 74%), and Norwegian individual quotas (estimated current -22%, maximum 43%). Fishery characteristics other than management might influence the estimated resource rent, and the results are discussed in relation to biological sustainability. The method used across fisheries and countries for the estimation of the current economic rent, based on standardized opportunity costs of labor and capital, exaggerates the current positive rent for the ITQ fishery and the negative rent for the individual quota fishery.

AB  - Land uses such as forestry are concerned with applying standardized management schemes to meet management goals and serve the interests of various actors. As a consequence of differences in actors' power to influence forest management, certain goals and silvicultural ideals will be promoted at the expense of others and thereby homogenize forest management. At the same time, "ideal" outcomes are often hard to achieve in practice and forest owners might not be willing to fully implement programs promoted by the state or industrial actors due to conflicting ideas. In southern Sweden a profit and production-oriented paradigm bolstered by powerful industrial forestry actors promotes clearcutting with Norway spruce (Picea abies) or Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) on the areas managed for timber production. Through qualitative interviews with forestry advisors and desk research this study investigates challenges associated with promoting these production-oriented silvicultural ideals among small-scale private forest owners. The study highlights deviations of actual practices from the silvicultural ideals, and explores forest advisors' perceptions of causes of these deviations, thereby providing insights into challenges associated with production-oriented steering through advisory services. In the studied case, owners and advisors have had to cope with extreme storms and severe browsing damages. Interviewed advisors also perceived a number other factors to be associated with deviations, such as lack of time or knowledge among owners, high costs associated with pre-commercial thinning and owner preferences.y

AB  - Children explore their environment through experiences and each experience is meaningful in developing their environmental consciousness and identity. On the basis of the drawn landscape experiences, the present qualitative study set out to find out what landscapes the participating students deemed worth conserving. The data consisted of the drawings of 11- to 16-year-old Finnish (n = 311) and Swedish (n = 246) students. Deductive and inductive content analyses were used to analyse the data. The results showed that all three landscape types; nature, built, and social were presented in the drawings. Nature and built landscapes were the most frequent types, with the proportion of nature landscapes increasing and that of built landscapes decreasing with age. There were gender and cultural preferences: boys drew built landscapes more often than girls; and Finnish students drew summer cottages, a cultural phenomenon typical of Finnish landscapes, which was not found in Swedish drawings. Similarities in Finnish and Swedish data were identified e.g., in forest and water and cultural landscapes. Some of the students displayed a more distant, observing role, whereas others adopted an active one in relation to all three landscape types. The results are discussed in connection to the landscape theories and earlier findings of the drawn environments.

AB  - In Finland, the railway is a vital transportation system. A large quantity of raw materials, goods and passengers are transported on mixed traffic tracks. Due to freeze-thaw cycles, differential frost heave can affect the track performance and results in speed restrictions. The maintenance of winter-related problems on heavy haul railway lines is expensive and causes difficulties for the flow of rail traffic. In order to make maintenance cost-effective and sustainable it is essential to identify the problem areas and determine their causes. During the last decade the ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique has proven to be an effective and non-destructive method to measure railway structures and various material properties. This paper presents and discusses the key results obtained in a research project that studied the potential of the GPR method to locate track sections on Finnish railways experiencing frost problems and produce input data for preventative maintenance planning for areas at risk of developing differential frost heave. The GPR data, digital video and GPS coordinates, collected from the railway sections were combined with reference data and railway databases using the Railway Doctor software. This integrated data was then interpreted and analysed using multiple parameters specifically selected for the purpose of identifying the frost-susceptible sub-ballast structures and subgrade soils and defining the root cause of frost problems using the GPR frequency analysis techniques.

AB  - In climate change mitigation, backcasting scenarios are often used for exploring options for achieving a single environmental goal, albeit at the expense of other goals. This paper assesses potential conflicts and synergies between multiple environmental policy goals based on four future scenarios on Swedish rural land use, assuming zero GHG emissions in 2060. The assessment shows that goal conflicts are apparent, and policy makers need to make trade-offs between goals. The choice of strategy for dealing with these trade-offs yields conflicts or synergies. The assessment shows that a transition to zero GHG emissions provides opportunities for Sweden to shift to carbon free land-use planning. Overall, there are alternative ways with different underlying assumptions to achieve zero GHG emissions, which will feed discussions on new opportunities to overcome multi-scale and multi-sectoral goal conflicts. Multi-target backcasting scenarios are considered more suited to account for the multi-dimensional aspects of goal conflicts. This requires a comprehensive multi-target backcasting approach, which combines the strengths of multicriteria analysis, nexus approaches and backcasting, for supporting a transition to zero GHG emissions.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is predicted to lead to an area-related reduction in population size and a decreasing colonisation rate due to isolation. A reduction in grassland size may promote a "run-away-decline process" leading to reduced individual fitness and viability of the populations originally inhabiting the grassland. To circumvent the problems of time-lags associated with the slow response of long-lived plants to semi-natural grassland fragmentation, four short-lived grassland species were studied. During three years, data on population sizes were gathered for Carum carvi, Rhinanthus minor, Trifolium arvense and Viola tricolor in Swedish semi-natural grasslands varying in size and degree of isolation. A seed-sowing experiment was conducted to assess dispersal and seed limitation at a local and regional scale, respectively. Overall, the presence/absence of species was not related to fragment size and isolation (connectivity). However, for the fragments where the species were present, positive relationships between grassland size and population size were detected for three species. No significant relationships between isolation and population size were detected for any species. This study thus demonstrates that short-lived plant species, confined to semi-natural grasslands, respond to decreases in fragment size by forming smaller populations. Seed sowing indicated that the species are both dispersal and seed limited in the study area, and that disturbances are important for establishment. In order to maintain characteristic grassland species in fragmented (isolated) semi-natural grasslands, it may therefore be of interest to preserve large intact fragments instead of several small ones.

AB  - Due to various intergovernmental agreements, marine managers must establish marine conservation measures to prevent the destruction of conservation-relevant benthic habitats e.g. Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME). To aid this process, international "lists" of indicator species and habitats are created based on various conservation "criteria". As these lists are both generalised and under development, there is a need to create comparable (management) regional lists to ensure regional relevance and to propose new international "list candidates". This study provides a method to assess management region relevant (hereafter "regional")/new benthic biotopes for conservation-relevance. Quantitative criteria-linked descriptors (e.g. species richness, predicted area occupancy, etc) are used to rank biotopes, enabling a comparison between listed and new biotopes. This highlights comparatively high-ranking new biotopes as potentially conservation-relevant. In a Norwegian case study, applied to the Barents Sea management region using data from the MAREANO programme, the criteria from three international frameworks (EBSA/Azores, FAO/VME, OSPAR/Texel Faial) are assessed with descriptors obtainable from existing or future baseline datasets (video survey data, biotope classifications, and predictive biotope maps). Here, the method correctly ranks existing listed biotopes highly but it also identifies, for example, a previously unlisted biotope as potentially conservation relevant (Cucumaria sea cucumbers, Eucratea bryozoans, and Thuiaria hydroids on coarse bottoms with highly variable conditions). This biotope is now accepted as having regional significance warranting national conservation attention. The dominant bryozoan has also since been listed as a FAO VME indicator within ICES/NEAFC. Although demonstrated in a region with an outstanding dataset, the method is transferable to anywhere with partial baseline data that can inform biotope classification.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been established to counteract negative effects of agricultural intensification on e.g. semi-natural pastures and meadows. The efficiency of most AESs have, however, been poorly evaluated. We evaluated the success of a Swedish AES for the management of semi-natural pastures by comparing species richness and composition of vascular plants (except trees), epiphytic lichens and trees among pastures receiving higher (high value pastures) and lower levels of AES paymens (general value pastures). There was no difference in the number of tree species among high and general value pastures, even though AES regulations allow a maximum of 60 and 100 trees/ha in general and high value pastures, respectively. High value pastures had, however, a higher number of plant and epiphytic lichen species than common value pastures. Moreover, a higher number of pasture specialist plant species were indicative of high value pastures than of general value pastures. No lichen species indicating high value pastures are associated with habitats with low canopy cover (such as e.g. pastures). Finally, tree identity was an important factor for explaining the number and composition of epiphytic lichen species. Our study highlights that species groups can respond differently to agri-environment schemes and other conservation measures. Even though the effects are the desired on the diversity of one assessed taxon, this is not always the case for non-target organism groups.

AB  - We investigated the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on population functioning. We compared demography ( daily and total population sizes) and dispersal ( dispersal rate and dispersal kernels) of the bog fritillary butterfly in two 6-km(2) landscapes differing in their degree of fragmentation. In 2000, we conducted a Capture-Mark-Recapture experiment in a highly fragmented system in the marginal part of the species distribution ( Belgium) and in a more continuous system in the central part of its distribution ( Finland). A total of 293 and 947 butterflies were marked with 286 and 190 recapture events recorded in the fragmented and the continuous system respectively. Our results suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation affect dispersal more than demography. Although density was lower in the continuous system, it remains in the yearly range of variation observed on 10 generations in the fragmented system. However, in the fragmented system, the dispersal rate dropped drastically (39 vs. 64%) and females moved longer distances. Patch area had a significant effect on migration in the fragmented system only. From our results, we propose the definition of a new parameter, the minimal patch area (MPA) needed to establish a local population in highly fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Improving our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of migratory game species is pivotal for developing flyway-based management strategies. We used miniaturized GPS-Argos transmitters to analyse movement patterns, home-range, habitat use, and pre-breeding migratory dynamics of a medium-sized (similar to 80 g) migratory songbird, the Fieldfare (Turdus pilaris). We focused on the population wintering in northern Italy, an area where this species is subject to intense hunting pressure during autumn-winter. Most individuals were relatively sedentary upon reaching their wintering area, with only a few performing erratic movements up to mid-January. Forest and farmland were the most used habitats during both early and late winter. We obtained partial information on pre-breeding migration from 16 individuals. Pre-breeding migration began on 21 March on average (min.: 7 March, max.: 7 April). We identified north-western Russia (longitudes 35-50 degrees E) as the putative breeding area of six individuals, while a single individual migrated to Finland. Our novel individual-based tracking study of south-European wintering Fieldfares thus highlights that Russia, rather than Scandinavia, is likely the main origin area for Italian wintering birds, improving previous knowledge based on recoveries of ringed birds. Our findings suggest that an effective flyway-based management plan for a sustainable exploitation of the Fieldfare in southern Europe may be hindered by knowledge gaps on the conservation status of this species over its broad breeding range, which extends to distant Russian regions.

AB  - In this paper, we present a method for base-line mapping of biotope and landscape elements in the rural Swedish agricultural landscape. The overall goal is to elaborate a classification system for a national landscape monitoring program, based on interpretation of existing colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs at the scale 1:30000, and including a field control. The classification system developed was tested by mapping landscape elements in strategically selected test areas, and it is assessed with respect to interpretation accuracy. The landscape elements, mapped separately as patches, lines and points, are significant for the biodiversity on landscape level, and are susceptible to change. The classification system is based on a hierarchical approach in five levels, with regard to land use and management, nature type and succession stage, moisture, physiognomy, vegetation cover and plant species. By using the method and the suggested classification system, a base-line mapping can be done very quickly and accurately. The mapping rate is 1.4-2.8 km(2)/h and the interpretation accuracy is 95-99%. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Lately, there has been a growing interest in how to include biodiversity in life cycle assessment (LCA). The aim of this study was to compare two impact assessment methods, with regard to their applicability on a regional level and their feasibility in terms of data availability, through applying them to a case study.
   MethodsThe methods tested were those developed by de Baan et al. (2013a), based on species richness, and Lindner et al. (2014), based on ecosystem indicators. These were applied to commercially managed spruce forest in the south of Sweden. For the species-based method, characterization factors (CFs) were based on species richness of vascular plants in the region, calculated for two different stages in the production cycle, before and after felling, and using two different types of semi-natural reference situations. The key feature in the ecosystem approach was a set of indicators of prerequisites for biodiversity, based on expert knowledge, and the reference situation applied was the hypothetic maximum biodiversity quality in the region.
   Results and discussionThe results showed that both methods were applicable for biodiversity assessment at regional level. All methodological requirements, such as species data and expert opinion, were available. To obtain enough data for the species richness method, data on vascular plants from two administrative regions was needed. When biodiversity was assessed before felling and using the spruce reference situation, the conventional spruce forestry studied was shown to have positive impact on biodiversity. All other results showed negative impacts on biodiversity. The positive impact indicated by the species richness method was probably due to the small difference in species richness between the mature spruce forest assessed and the available spruce forest reference situation.
   ConclusionsThe study shows that the two methods are applicable on a regional level, although data availability was a constraint in the species richness method by de Baan et al. (2013a). The choice of reference situation, and when in the production cycle assessment was made, led to considerable differences in the characterization factors generated.

AB  - The archaeological deposits in medieval towns are among the most important and distinctive heritage monuments in Norway. At the same time they are among the more challenging phenomena confronting heritage management authorities, municipal planners, and property owners/developers alike, especially in relation to building and infrastructure projects. The modern settlement has developed on top of medieval and younger deposits which means that not only are they an irreplaceable depository of historical information, but they also form a significant part of the modern town's physical foundation.
   Since 2002 the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway (Riksantik-varen) has been funding systematic monitoring of archaeological deposits of the World Heritage Site Bryggen in Bergen. The monitoring programme consists of several approaches: archaeological assessment of the deposits state of preservation, biochemical investigation of preservation conditions within the deposits, hydrogeological mapping of the water table, water flow, and other given parameters.
   Continuous systematic monitoring by using testable, replicable methods and measures, data, and results acquire increased quality and validity. These in turn provide the cultural heritage management with a toolbox for making correct decisions and thereby allow the government's preservation targets to be attained. But, most important, it guarantees the preservation of the 'underground archives' and at the same time allows the urban centres to develop.
   This paper presents the knowledge developed through monitoring the Bryggen site as a basis for an official Norwegian standard covering archaeological, biochemical, and hydrogeological deposit investigations.

AB  - The price of oil has been and is one of the most discussed and analyzed points in Ecuador, Norway and the world since the second industrial revolution because of the cost-benefit to the detriment of the environment. Consequently, this research project is aimed at explaining the difference in development between Ecuador and Norway, analyzing socioeconomic and environmental situations for the realization of econometric models that mathematically explain the dependence and characterization of the economic structure of the two countries, in benefit of providing information to Ecuador based on the Norwegian experience. The fulfillment of the marked objectives was realized thanks to the free econometric software Gretl with simple MCO models, descriptive analysis of graphs and finally through 4 VAR models. Based on the results, it is established that Ecuador could not currently apply the Norwegian model, due to cultural and political reasons and because of its already high dependence on petroleum, verified through econometric models.

AB  - The tunnelling industry has the means to make any "hole in the ground" almost to any size and shape that is requested. The main challenge is to integrate such solutions in the long-term development and urban planning. The underground solutions must be cost-effective to compete with surface alternatives and they must be safe and felt to be safe by the users. By ensuring that we are capable of providing safe underground structure will underground infrastructure be perceived to provide a sound internal environment. This paper discusses the challenges of designing and building lame underground caverns needed for a further developing of the underground infrastructure. Some examples are also provided to visualise the beauty of underground rock caverns and their use to serve the public and thus constituting a major asset to the society. In modem societies there are growing concerns related to the safety and security of our infrastructure system. In addition surface space is becoming a scarce resource placing limitations on urban expansion. The environment needs to be protected and the aesthetics considered. Underground storage of oil and gas has showed an extremely good record in all these important aspects of the modern societies and is thus a popular method for such products. The application of large underground caverns has seen a wide range of use in Nonvay during the last 30 to 40 years. It began with a demand arising from the development of Hydroelectric Power schemes in the post-war period. For the civil defense it became obvious that such solutions could realize combined shelters and sports facilities. During a few decades of heavily development of this field a large number of combined underground shelters and swimming pools and sports halls were built. It culminated with the construction of the most famous one, the Gjovik mountain hall, large enough too room the ice-hockey rank for the Winter Olympics in Norway in 1994.

AB  - Immigration in Finland has increased significantly in the last decades. The integration of immigrants and autochthonous Finns poses new challenges to the society. Nevertheless, the resulting cultural diversity creates opportunities for intercultural social development. According to previous studies, urban nature can benefit human well-being and it can also play a role in integration processes. However, the role urban nature can potentially play in integration is largely overlooked, and immigrants are rarely involved in the planning of urban nature. This paper presents the main results of a qualitative study carried out in Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. The aim was to understand the role of urban nature in integration, and to address how the planning of urban nature can support integration and interculturalism. We found that using urban nature helps immigrants feel comfortable and enjoy their living environment. The interviewed immigrants were interested in getting information on urban planning, especially in their own neighbourhood, and many of them wanted to participate in planning, although they were unsure of their right to do so, and access to planning processes appeared problematic in many ways. To support integration and interculturalism, urban planning should take the opportunity to enhance intercultural understanding. Adhering to culturally sensitive processes, and developing trust with local residents by taking their views seriously, can do this. Nature has the potential to inspire people to connect with one another. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the main changes in the flows of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the Finnish agricultural and forest sectors during the 20th century were identified and quantified and their future trends were considered. Both the inputs and outputs of N and P to agricultural soil increased during the 20th century. We estimated that biological N fixation in agricultural soil was highest in the 1930s, when it accounted for approximately 40-50% of the N fertilization level at the turn of the Millenium. The total N input to agricultural soil increased almost fourfold between 1910 and 1980-1990 and P input increased nearly eightfold between 1910 and 1970 resulting in an apparent soil surplus of N and P. However, during the last decades, the apparent soil surplus significantly decreased, following the reduction in fertilizing and increasing nutrient outputs in crop yields. The nutrient flows in the forest sector are considerably smaller than agricultural flows. Although the current land area used for forestry in Finland is about 8 times larger than that used for agricultural production, N inputs to the agricultural soil are about 2.5 times and P inputs about 4 times higher than to the forest soil. N outputs (harvest) from the agricultural soil are about 5 times and P outputs about 6 times higher than from forest soil. The observed surpluses have enabled the increase in nutrient losses to water (N, P) and air (N) or their accumulation in soil (N, P), and further, contribution to several environmental problems such as eutrophication of lakes and the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to optimize forest management for a forest region (the total area of forest and scrub land 1.54 mill. ha) under changing climate by using the large-scale forestry scenario model MELA and sample plot data from the geo-referenced National Forest Inventory (NFI). The MELA model is based on integrated simulation and optimisation; in the simulation it utilises empirical tree-level models into which the impacts of climate change were introduced by transfer variables derived by using the physiological model FinnFor. Six scenarios with differences in climate and forest management were defined. In simulations, the accelerating tree growth caused by climate change resulted in an increase in maximum sustainable removal of trees at regional level. Changes in regionally optimized forest management were also detected during the analysis period of 30 years; the proportion of thinnings increased because the stands fulfilled the thinning requirements earlier than in the current climate. This study was the first attempt to solve endogenously maximum sustainable timber production and corresponding forest management at the regional level under different climate scenarios. When implemented in the MELA system, which is widely used in Finnish forestry, the transfer variables offer means of disseminating the results from physiological studies to planning of adjustment and mitigation measures under changing climate.

AB  - Wooden buildings used to be a common European building tradition in the Middle Ages. Wood was prohibited to use as a building material in towns and villages in most parts of Europe, because of the fire hazard. The authorities in Norway did not make strong efforts to make sure that the buildings would be built in brick, probably because of economic reasons. That is why we still have many wooden towns in our Country. These towns are now considered an exceptional contribution to the world architectural heritage.
   After the great fire in Alesund in 1904, wood was forbidden as a building material in towns in Norway. During the 20(th) century, the wooden towns decayed and many wooden buildings were demolished. From 1970-80 and onwards, there was a change in attitude. The old wooden towns are now restored and represent popular residential areas and their cultural value has been recognised. However, in Norway many of the wooden towns are still threatened. The buildings are not well protected and as time goes by, they are supposed to vanish and replaced by new, modem buildings in concrete and steel. Our historic wooden towns will probably slowly change in the direction of modem conformity.
   From an environmental and economic point of view, the authorities now encourage to use more wood as building material, also in towns. In this paper1 I will discuss how to preserve and develop the wooden towns with their urban character and qualities and discuss the architectural and cultural arguments for using wood in our towns. Should we regard the use of wooden material as part of the conservation principles of our wooden towns?

AB  - Of the EU countries, Sweden utilizes the highest proportion (10%) of its total agricultural land for horses. Horse paddocks commonly hold horses on a limited space, in the present study at a rate of 5-14 livestock units ha(-1). Thus these paddocks receive significant amounts of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) through feed residues and deposition of feces and urine, which can lead to nutrient build-up in the soil. This study examined soil P and N status in different parts of horse paddocks (feeding, grazing and excretion areas) and compared it with that in adjacent, unmanaged reference soils. The paddock areas were then categorized with respect to environmental risk using the threshold concentrations of plant-available P extracted with ammonium acetate lactate solution at pH 3.75 (P-AL) and total N set by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. In total, seven horse farms, covering different grazing densities and soil textures representative of Swedish horse paddocks, were examined. The results showed that concentrations of water-soluble P (WSP), P-AL, and total N were highest in feeding and excretion areas within the paddocks. Weighted concentrations of soil P for the whole paddocks amounted to 2.9-10.5 mg WSP kg(-1) and 35-224 mg P-AL kg(-1), and were higher than in the corresponding reference fields (0.8-4.9 mg WSP kg(-1) and 17-102 mg P-AL kg(-1)). The WSP concentration in the paddocks was strongly correlated with horse density (R-2 = 0.80***(1),n = 13) and P-AL with years of paddock management (R-2 = 0.78***, n = 13). Total organic C was significantly correlated with P-AL, total P and total N in the feeding and excretion areas. The degree of soil P saturation percentage (DPS%) were important soil parameters determining WSP concentration in the paddocks (R-2 = 0.63***, n = 110), whereas total P concentration in soils were determining P-AL concentrations (R-2 = 0.82***, n = 112). According to Swedish environmental guidelines, two of the seven farms studied posed a high risk and three a moderate risk of extensive P leaching losses, but the risk of extensive N losses was moderate for all farms studied. As regards the specific sections of the paddock, the feeding and excretion areas had the highest risk of P leaching losses. Thus paddock soils can be high-risk areas for P leaching comprising about 3.85% of the total high-risk land area in Sweden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is generally difficult to assess the performance of an infrastructure with a substantially longer life span than economic models can handle, and the life cycle concepts in urban water systems are normally limited to single-asset projects. In order to explore the long-term impact of urban water infrastructure rehabilitation strategies, a life cycle approach for survival functions is suggested. A life cycle factor based on survival functions is introduced, which is a measuring value of the total expected service life of all pipes within a group of pipes. Another factor, termed the sustainability factor, is based on the relationship between the life cycle factor and a rehabilitation reference method, which makes it possible to correct the long-term performance of rehabilitation methods based on their expected service life provision. A case study presents the implications for investments in infrastructure rehabilitation when applying the sustainability factor in long-term planning, and shows the importance of considering the service life of rehabilitation methods when planning renewal interventions that minimize costs over their life cycles.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been proposed as a model for sustainable urban and regional development beyond the troubled heritage of modernistic planning. Key to TOD is mixed use and reduced dependence on private cars. However, functionalistic land-use divides persist in the principles of TOD, such as the division between leisure and work and between permanent residences and second homes. These divides relate to, and are emphasised by, a strong focus on urban qualities within the TOD discourse, while discussions on landscape amenities are set aside. Following recent research on compensation theory and amenity migration, this study argues that densification of TODs could increase residents' dependency on second homes in the countryside. The study provides insights gained from semi structured interviews with senior residents in newly-built apartments and houses in a TOD location in Sweden. The interviews revealed how the importance of multiple dwellings is enhanced by the densification project and how car dependency is built into the model. The term 'part-time amenity migrant' has been coined to describe this phenomenon and increase awareness of landscape amenities in TOD locations. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, an attempt is made to better understand the contribution of hydropower in meeting electric energy needs of Turkey. Thus, a comparison between Turkey and other countries, which have some similarities with Turkey or which are more developed nations compared to Turkey, for evaluating from different aspects the contribution of hydropower in meeting electric energy needs is performed. The producers of electricity and hydroelectricity in the world, and the electric sectors of all the selected countries are firstly examined. Thereafter, Turkey's water resources and its potential, hydropower potential, and current status of hydropower in Turkey are investigated in detail. A detailed discussion regarding economic and energy indicators, hydroelectricity versus thermal electricity, the contributions of hydroelectricity to the total and renewable electricity generation, and the usage status of hydro potential of each selected nation is also made. Finally, it is found that hydropower is the second largest contributor in meeting Turkey's electric energy needs after thermal, mainly natural gas. It is also estimated that the contribution of hydropower will continue because a vast amount of its economically feasible hydro potential (about 64%) is undeveloped. Besides, it is determined that the contribution of hydropower in the total electricity generation in Turkey is greater than that of China and India, but it is lower than that of Norway, Brazil, and Canada.

AB  - Concerns about the effects of climate change have led to an interest in identifying ways to foster sustainability transitions. In the Global North, a key approach is to eventually eliminate dependence on carbon emitting energy while moving towards renewable sources, including wind power. Since wind farms require vast amounts of land, inevitably this explains the presence of such installations in many rural regions. This situation has alarmed various stakeholders, including those involved in tourism, who see such developments as threats to idyllic notions of rurality and, by default, to the transformation of the countryside for visitor experiences. Through a series of case studies in rural Sweden, we explore the attitudes of tourists towards the presence of wind farms in the landscape. Overall, study respondents recognize the need for such installations since most accept the necessity to embark on sustainable energy transitions. In this way, they understand that many parts of rural Sweden are transforming into spaces where sustainable energy future must be negotiated. Ultimately, sustainability transitions lead to the rethinking of conventional perceptions around rural space and tourism. We suggest that geographical research on sustainability transitions in tourism should account for conceptions of rurality that involve assemblages of imagination, place framing, and power relations in sustainability transitions. This conceptualization is necessary for achieving just and sustainable energy futures.

AB  - This study analyses the implementation of the EU Floods Directive in Sweden. The question here centres on the possibilities promoted by the directive for sustainable flood risk management, with an emphasis on integrated and participatory management forms. Key persons are interviewed, using a set of criteria for sustainable river basin management as a theoretical framework. The study shows that work in this area is guided by a wide array of values, and that the involved experts provide a broad knowledge basis for this work. The need for better coordination between authorities, pieces of legislation and policy fields however remains critical while the merits of participatory planning approaches are not yet sufficiently utilised. One of the primary tasks here is to develop a shared understanding of the formal context and roles of the process while also developing forms for effective collaboration both within the new administration and between the administration and other key actors, most importantly the municipalities. The case of Sweden can provide useful insights into this process for other member states.

TI  - Monitoring of forest biodiversity from forest resource inventory data
T2  - ASSESSMENT OF BIODIVERSITY FOR IMPROVED FOREST PLANNING
LA  - English
CP  - Conference on Assessment of Biodiversity for Improved Planning
AB  - Forest biodiversity has become a new concern for society. It has introduced new regulations and new ways of thinking in areas of forest use and planning. In Sweden the Forestry Act of 1993 states that timber production and maintenance of biodiversity are objectives of equal dignity. This results in a need for monitoring the maintenance of biodiversity in order to know if the policy intentions are followed. The problem of maintenance of biodiversity can be looked at from different scales, such as species, ecosystem, landscape, regional and national.
   On the national and regional level it is possible to use forest resource inventory data to get an overview of the forest biodiversity changes. The method used was to analyse the relative changes of variables related to biodiversity over time. The changes are compared to a reference period (1983-1987) and can be calculated as either an annual change or as a moving average of three years data. The variables studied were proportion of the broadleaved species in middle aged forests, amount of dead or windthrown trees, amount of big trees, amount of old unmanaged forest, proportion of wet forests, clear-cut area and habitat diversity. These variables are considered important substrata to produce and maintain a high forest biodiversity.
   The results show that it is possible to follow the changes of the substrata (prerequisites) which indicate a high forest biodiversity on a broader scale. By introducing new variables more directly related to biodiversity and combining different information sources more effective methods can be developed.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and climate change are both prominent manifestations of global change, but there is little knowledge on the specific mechanisms of how climate change may modify the effects of habitat fragmentation, for example, by altering dynamics of spatially structured populations. The long-term viability of metapopulations is dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole. Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23years of butterfly survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period. We first examined the associations between population growth rates within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics. We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions being most important. We further found that the increase in metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony, such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.

AB  - This paper presents long-range forest management analyses with the objective of mapping consequences for the timber production potential when forest management treatments are changed in an environmentally oriented direction. Sample plots from the National Forest Inventory, covering the entire productive forest area in Norway, were aggregated into 10000 treatment units. Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas. With a real rate of discount of 2.5%, and all the constraints imposed simultaneously, the annual harvest potential was reduced by 30% for the first 10-year period, while the net present value was reduced by 21.5%. The results further demonstrated significant efficiency gains of letting the preservation of old forest be allocated cost-efficiently, compared with a strategy of setting aside an equal portion oil all eligible areas.

AB  - Recent scholarship has argued that effective and credible national climate policy mixes should encompass measures that promote new low-carbon technologies alongside those instruments aimed at constraining and phasing out support for existing polluting industries. The creative and disruptive policy measures in Norway ' s climate policy mix are analysed by focusing on both national and international climate mitigation efforts. Norway ' s climate policy mix at home has been more ambitious in the transport sector with a growing electric vehicle market than in the energy sector where niche support and disruptive policies have remained weak. Abroad, Norway has been increasingly active in supporting new low-carbon technologies and disrupting the fossil-fuel industry, especially coal. This is explained by the consensus-seeking and oil and gas dominated small-state social-investment political economy in Norway, combined with a forward-looking foreign policy based on norm-setting and multilateralism.

AB  - HELCOM (Helsinki Commission) has adopted a programme with a vision of a healthy Baltic Sea Environment, with diverse biological components functioning in balance, resulting in good environmental status and supporting a wide range of sustainable human economic activities. HELCOM assessments presented in the Stakeholder Conference plan of 2007 clearly show that problems with eutrophication exist in most of the sub-basins of the Baltic and that good environmental status has not been achieved. Agriculture is responsible for a large share of the leaching of nutrients to watercourses, including groundwater lakes and finally the sea. The analysis of data presented in this paper concludes that specialized agriculture with its separation of crop and animal production results in a high load of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Baltic Sea. This agricultural specialization took place throughout the Scandinavian countries after World War 11 and has resulted in farms with a high density of animals and great surpluses of plan[ nutrients concentrated to certain regions. Examples from Sweden are presented in this paper. This trend of increasing products per animal and per hectare on fewer farms and a higher surplus of nutrients on each of them is continuing in Sweden and is likely to spread to new EU member countries within the Baltic Sea drainage area with the probable consequence of increasing nutrient loads. Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) is defined as an agriculture system based on local an(] renewable resources that integrate animal and crop production on each farm or farms in close proximity. As a result a large pail of the nutrient uptake in the fodder is effectively recycled. This in effect means that each farm strives to be self-sufficient in fodder production, which in turn limits animal density and ensures a more even distribution of animals geographically. This study of 12 Swedish farms confirms earlier results that agriculture based on these principles of ecological recycling can lead to a decrease in the potential emission of reactive nitrogen by half as well as a significant reduction in the accumulation and loss of reactive phosphorus. Application of these agricultural principles throughout the Baltic region in all EU countries would result in the halving of reactive nitrogen losses and minimizing losses of reactive phosphorus. In this way the goals, set by the states of the region, could be met and the process leading to the worst-case scenario of greatly increased nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea could be stopped.

AB  - In Norway, a landscape map exists which gives the opportunity to collect data in landscape units for further analysis. This study covers parts of Norway and Sweden, so the landscape map was extended into Sweden to form a unified landscape structure. A collection of geological and terrain data within landscape units can serve as a tool to describe the geodiversity profile of the units, study their geographical distribution and analyse similarities and dissimilarities between them. We collected geological and terrain data for an area covering large parts of southern Norway and Sweden. The data were collected as attributes in landscape polygons. The data were then analysed using multivariate techniques (Principle component analyses) where the first four axes of variation were definable. The first axis is a terrain axis, the second a bedrock unit axis, the third a bedrock diversity axis and the fourth a soil/sediment axis. In total, the four gradients answer for 54.9% of the total variation in the material. Links are found between the terrain data and geological units, but these links are relatively weak. The four gradients represent a step-less model of the geodiversity profile of the landscape areas but are dependent on the quality and scale of the input data. Norwegian and Swedish data had to be harmonised in order to be analysed together; however, because of this they ended up having a coarser resolution than desired, both spatially and scientifically. The stepless model was clustered to form 16 geodiversity profile groups for easy comparison and regional overview. The procedure can serve as a baseline for more detailed and field-based studies of geodiversity profiles, and give the opportunity to make analytical maps through simple overlay techniques and to compare areas with each other with respect to their geodiversity profile. This can be carried out both alone and in a wider landscape setting.

AB  - The landscape context is crucial for forest conservation in regions where the natural forest is fragmented. The focus of practical conservation is currently shifting from local stands to a landscape perspective, but few studies have tested the relative effect of different spatial and temporal scales for occurrence and persistence of species of conservation concern. We studied Red Data Book and Indicator species (the latter proposed to indicate presence of Red Data Book species) of vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes and wood-inhabiting fungi in 22 old temperate broadleaved forests in southern Sweden. We analysed at which scales these species respond to habitat proportion in surrounding landscape. The proportion of suitable habitat was measured at two temporal scales (present-day and historic) and at two spatial scales (about 0-1 km and 1-5 kin of study sites). Local density of Red Data Book species increased with increasing proportion of suitable habitat in the current landscape (within 1-5 km of study sites) while Indicator species were unaffected. The response to landscape differed between organism groups. Vascular plants (near significantly) and wood-inhabiting fungi showed a time delay of 120 years in their response, indicating a possible regional extinction debt. An appropriate minimum landscape scale for conservation of Red Data Book species in temperate broadleaved forests in Sweden seems to be about 5 kin (radius), but smaller landscapes may be important for vascular plants and wood-inhabiting fungi of conservation concern. In addition, restoration is urgent to counteract the effect of time delays in species responses to recent habitat loss. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Past fire regimes may indicate under what conditions species have been able to exist in the past, but they do not provide clear and easy answers as to how the boreal landscape should be managed today. First, fire regimes have changed considerably over time through the effects of a changing climate, and sometimes even more dramatically through the influence of humans. Therefore it is unlikely that a close quantitative link exists between fire regime and biodiversity. Alternatively, if there is such a link, then biodiversity should have been highly variable in the past, even at the landscape scale. Second, it is impossible to re-enact all fire variables within forestry, particularly those operating at the landscape scale. An alternative to the superficial "emulation" of the past, which is so often claimed in today's forest management. would be to identify critical processes and habitats at the stand and landscape scale and find ways to maintain these at sufficient Levels. This requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms involved, and will lead to very different solutions for different groups of species. For example: whereas the highly mobile fire-dependent insects can make use of randomly appearing and relatively small burns in the landscape, fire-dependent plants are typically seed bankers and require that fire returns to the same site within a reasonable time. For these and other more or less "sessile" organisms it is vital to designate selected stands and landscapes with long-term plans for the use of fire. Without such a long-term commitment to selected localities, much of the unique features associated with fire in the boreal landscape will be lost, despite a costly investment in prescribed burning.

AB  - By adopting a qualitative approach and considering the case of Sweden, the aim of the paper is to investigate and analyse how private forest owners' experiences and emotions related to their private forest ownership manifest themselves in their relationship to public use of their forests and public planning for recreation and biodiversity on their land. The study incorporates and elaborates upon a conceptual framework related to the dimensions of property rights, feelings of ownership, and sense of place in its analysis of the private forest ownership context. Fifty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with forest owners owning land in two geographically different areas. The results demonstrate the important role of the 'social contract' of rights and responsibilities, which are associated with the concept of property rights, and are embedded in the relationship between private ownership and the Swedish custom of the Right of Public Access to nature in the broad acceptance of public use of private forestland. The forest owners' relationships with public planning are diverse and complex, illustrating the various dimensions of private forest ownership, the heterogeneous forest owner corps, and the different geographical contexts. The dimensions of ownership feelings and sense of place, and the interplay between them, are shown to contribute to enhanced sentiments linked to forest ownership, expressed in ambivalence or lack of conviction about public planning. An important point of resistance to public interests is owners' identity as stewards or long-term custodians of their particular forestland. The article ends with a set of recommendations for public policy and planning processes regarding public interests related to private forest ownership.

AB  - Norway is the largest global producer and exporter of farmed salmon, however the growth of the industry has coincided with environmental impacts to the marine ecosystem and negative perceptions of salmon farming. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is one solution, and scientists in Norway have researched salmon-driven IMTA for over a decade. Their research suggests that IMTA can mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts of salmon farming through waste recycling, however regulations in Norway do not allow IMTA. A participatory workshop was conducted to assess the future of IMTA in Norway, and participants were experts with a comprehensive understanding of the biological and technological processes of IMTA or salmon farming. Two group exercises gave participants the opportunity to conceptualize IMTA in the Norwegian salmon industry, and results indicate that IMTA would improve perceptions of the industry, create skilled jobs in coastal communities, and provide the industry with new sustainable sources of marine ingredients for feed. Participants identified that advocates of IMTA have a difficult task in advancing their agenda because of other stakeholders, such as policymakers and the public concerned with the environmental impacts from salmon farming, communities that regulate access to their coastal zone, and a powerful industry focused on producing salmon. This article explores how advocates could advance IMTA regulations in Norway using agenda building to influence policymakers and agenda setting to sway public opinion. This is the first interdisciplinary article on IMTA in the Norwegian salmon industry using a social science approach.

AB  - Forests and forestry in Sweden are dominated by conifers. Silviculture using mixed or broadleaved stands is often recommended, but the degree to which broadleaves regenerate naturally needs to be clarified. The Swedish National Forest Inventory is here used for a region-wide study of broadleaved saplings (1.3 m tall to 4.9 cm dbh) regenerated naturally. For 12 species (taxa) in young forests (< 7 m tall) and high forests (> 7 m), sapling densities were related to seven forest types and three productivity classes. Birch had highest densities in all but two broadleaved forest types. Birch, oak, rowan and sallow had 70-85% of their total sapling populations in conifer-dominated forest types, indicating good potential for mixed stands. Beech, lime, hornbeam, ash and elm were mostly restricted to 'noble' (hardwood) forests. The regeneration success (saplings per mature tree) for birch, rowan and oak was highest in conifer-dominated forest; beech was about equally successful in conifer-dominated and broadleaved forests, and ash was very successful in broadleaved forest. Oak regeneration may be problematical in broadleaved forests, but we suggest this is not the case in conifer-dominated forests (where oaks have rarely been studied). Sapling densities of the species in the forest types were not consistently correlated with productivity, but birch and aspen generally regenerated strongest at intermediate and at high productivity, respectively. In noble forests, oak, ash and elm regenerated strongest at low productivity. The role of asexual regeneration (sprouting) remains to clarify. Our results suggest that lime, elm, ash and some other trees currently are limited mainly by poor dispersal, rather than habitat availability. The results are promising for various forms of mixed-species forestry that does not require planting (or little planting) and that would be beneficial for nature conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pollen analysis was combined with radiocarbon dating, physical, chemical and biological soil analyses and soil micromorphology, to investigate the prehistoric land use at Orstad, in Jaeren, southwestern Norway.
   Orstad is an Early Bronze Age clearance cairn field in a cultural landscape with traces of land use back to the Neolithic. Samples were mainly collected from an 84 m long excavated trench with mainly podzolic soils. Although pollen preservation was poor, it was possible to differentiate five phases in the local vegetation and land use history. Human impact on the site could be traces back to about 4400-4000 BP uncal./3045-2600 cal. BC. Wheat and barley have been cultivated at Orstad during a period from ca. 3600 BP uncal./1945-1750 cal. BC until the Older Iron Age, when heather vegetation began to spread on the site.
   Soil micromorphology revealed different soil management practices for this time period: The soils seem to have been cleared by fire, prior to cultivation until ca. 3200 BP uncal./1610-1455 cal. BC. Then, new cultivation fields were laid out on higher levels, and seem to have been improved by adding of organic materials, mainly turves taken from podzolic top soils and peats from nearby localities.

AB  - In this article, I explore the reception of American "quality" serial television in Sweden from 1999 to the mid-2010s. My analysis includes how cultural critics and journalists writing for Sweden's leading newspapers conceptualised American serial television as "quality TV" and as legitimate "art", and it charts the ways in which these discourses relate to the reconfiguration of Swedish television from public service monopoly to niche-oriented multichannel system. The analysis uncovers a process of cultural consecration that was based on comparisons with already consecrated art forms, applications of authorship discourses that promote certain individuals as genius television auteurs, and deployment of critical protocols borrowed from literary criticism - all in service of pre-established cultural hierarchy and "good taste". This article also highlights the ubiquity of American quality serial television across the Swedish television landscape, which suggests that such programmes represent both a niche product and a mass phenomenon with extensive reach and multidimensional appeal.

AB  - Northern forest ecosystems are exposed to a range of anthropogenic processes including global warming, atmospheric deposition, and changing land-use. The vegetation of northern forests is composed of species with several functional traits related to these processes, whose effects may be difficult to disentangle. Here, we combined analyses of spatio-temporal dynamics and functional traits of ground flora species, including morphological characteristics, responses to macro- and microclimate, soil conditions, and disturbance. Based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, we compared changes in occurrence of a large number of ground flora species during a 20-year period (1994-2013) in boreal and temperate Sweden respectively. Our results show that a majority of the common ground flora species have changed their overall frequency. Comparisons of functional traits between increasing and declining species, and of trends in mean trait values of sample plots, indicate that current floristic changes are caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use. Changes and their relations with plant traits were generally larger in temperate southern Sweden. Nutrient-demanding species with mesotrophic morphology were favored by ongoing eutrophication due to nitrogen deposition in the temperate zone, while dwarf shrubs with low demands on nitrogen decreased in frequency. An increase of species with less northern and less eastern distribution limits was also restricted to temperate Sweden, and indicates effects of a moister and milder macroclimate. A trend toward dense plantation forests is mirrored by a decrease of light-demanding species in both vegetation zones, and a decrease of grassland species in the temperate zone. Although denser tree canopies may buffer effects of a warmer climate and of nitrogen deposition to some extent, traits related to these processes were weakly correlated in the group of species with changing frequency. Hence, our results indicate specific effects of these often confounded anthropogenic processes.

AB  - The seminatural grasslands are some of the most species-rich biotopes in Sweden. The creation and maintenance of their biological and cultural values are dependent on continuous management. However, due to the diminishing number of grazing animals, there has been a substantial loss of seminatural grasslands during the last century. The paper discusses how the seminatural grasslands, their biodiversity and future use are linked to social aspects. One underlying aim has been to explore how geographical perspectives can help to bridge the gap between social and natural science in nature resource management research. Case studies, including interviews with farmers, have been carried out in four rural areas in Sweden. The local contexts are described by using components in Norgaard's structural frame of the integrated relation man-environment, co-evolution; environment, social organization, value systems and knowledge. The concept of resilience provides an analytical frame for discussing the conditions and prospects for the future management of seminatural grasslands. The result shows similarities between the areas as regards possible options and measures for the enhancement of seminatural grassland management. There are also significant differences, indicating the need for flexible landscape policies, allowing adaptive management in various local contexts. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green care is an innovative approach that combines simultaneously caring for people and caring for land through three elements that have not been previously connected: (1) multifunctional agriculture and recognition of the plurality of agricultural system values; (2) social services and health care; and (3) the possibility of strengthening the farming sector and local communities. The current research provides a comprehensive overview of green care in Europe as a scientific discipline through a literature review (n = 98 studies). According to our results, the Netherlands, the UK, Norway and Sweden followed by Italy have led the scientific studies published in English. Green care research comprises a wide range of perspectives and frameworks (social farming, care farming, nature-based solutions, etc.) with differences in their specificities. Green care studies have mainly focused on measuring the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Studies that evaluate its relevance in socio-economic and environmental terms are still limited. According to our results, the most common users studied were people suffering from psychological and mental ill health, while the most common activities were horticulture, animal husbandry and gardening. Finally, we discuss the potential of green care to reconnect people with nature and to diversify the farming sector providing new public services associated with the relational values society obtains from the contact with agricultural systems.

AB  - This case study investigates the role of social-psychological variables in the general public's intention to support conservation of five local biotopes. A questionnaire survey of 245 people was carried out in Kristianstad Municipality, Sweden. In hierarchical regression analyses, public intention to support conservation was partly predicted by attitude toward biodiversity conservation and by personal norm. The relationship between these variables and intention differed depending on the ecological content of the biotope. It is concluded that when communicating the importance of conserving biotopes to the public, the message should be tailored according to the ecological content of the biotope as well as with regard to public attitudes and personal norms.

AB  - It has taken decades for the international community to recognize that climate change is a global issue that needs to be addressed by concerted international action. Many climate activists focus on the fossil fuel industry as the main culprit for greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for a cessation of investments in this sector. This is despite the fact that it is the use of oil and gas in housing, transportation and industry, not its production that represents over 90 per cent of its global emissions.' This misrepresents the global challenge that is one facing society's energy use at large. During this period of energy transition, and for decades to come, oil and gas will continue to constitute a major component of the world's growing energy demand. All energy consumers, whether governments, industries and the general public therefore need to reduce their energy consumption, while producing countries and companies need to reduce their carbon footprint, as well as increase investments in renewable energy. In this context, Norway serves as a valuable case study of what it takes to become a carbon efficient energy producer. The example of Lundin Energy AB, one of Europe's leading independent oil and gas producers, operating exclusively offshore Norway, shows how the Norwegian regulatory environment, coupled with the Company's sustainability commitments and its Decarbonization Strategy, have resulted in the production of one of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in the world.

AB  - The extinction debt of boreal forest species is estimated to be of the order of 1 000 species in Finland. Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, this paper examines the likely consequences for the survival of species of different scenarios of forest management and conservation. The results point to the conclusion that it generally pays to concentrate the efforts of improving forest quality at certain areas rather than to spread the same total effort evenly and therefore thinly throughout the entire forest landscape. The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species. The greatest positive effect is obtained if forests located close to the existing remnants of biologically diverse forests are restored, which would facilitate the migration of target species to the restored forests.

AB  - A Fourier spectral analysis of daily discharge time series over the last century in 79 unregulated catchments in Sweden reveals a significant gradual steepening of the discharge power spectrum slope over time. Where historical meteorological observations are available (the 41 southernmost catchments), the results of our analyses indicate that local land use changes within the catchments have affected discharge power spectra to a greater extent than have changes in precipitation patterns. 1-D distributed routing analysis based on current and historical maps and scenario modeling in the Tornestorp Catchment suggests that changes in stream network properties have led to increases in the hydraulic Peclet number (Pe) and subsequent decreases in the discharge power spectrum over short periods. The analysis displays analytically how a change in stream network properties can result in changes in the power spectra, where the relative importance of the geomorphological and hydrodynamic dispersion effects determines the shape of the streamflow response. The lowering of the discharge power spectrum over short periods observed for many Swedish catchments is likely caused by increasing Pe (a decrease in dispersion) over time, resulting in higher peak values, especially for rapid streamflow responses (i.e., over short periods), demonstrated empirically for the Tornestorp case study. The finding that the discharge power spectrum can change significantly over time highlights the need for hydrological models to account for the effect of the nonstationarity of parameters that result from temporal change caused by land use change and/or climate change that is due to anthropogenic or natural causes.

AB  - Microplastics (MP) are transported from land-based sources from rivers to marine waters. However, there is currently little knowledge about MP fate from land sources to marine waters. Traffic is estimated to be one of the largest sources of MP; hence, stormwater is expected to be an important transportation route of MP to marine waters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the size and density of tyre wear particles in road run-off on their fate in the Gota River in Sweden using hydrodynamic modelling. The model of the stretch of Gota River, Sweden's largest river, passing through Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city) and out to the sea, was set up using MIKE 3 FM software. Literature data were used to define the MP characteristics: concentrations in stormwater, prevalent particle sizes, density of MP commonly occurring in road run-off and settling velocities. Results show that higher concentrations of MP are found on the south side of the river, compared with the north side, due to higher annual average daily traffic loads along the south side of the river. The mixing processes in the river and the MP concentrations were generally influenced by the vertical water density gradient caused by saline water from the Kattegat strait. While most MP with higher density and larger size settle in the river, smaller MP with density close to 1.0 g/cm(3) do not settle in the river and therefore reach the Kattegat strait and the marine environments. Further research is needed to describe the fate and transport of microplastics in the stormwater system, including treatment facilities, i.e. biofouling, aggregation, degradation and/or further fragmentation and settling.

AB  - Historical sediment nutrient concentrations and heavy metal distributions were studied in four estuaries in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea to examine the response of these estuaries to temporal changes in human activities. Cores were collected using a 1-m Mackereth corer and dated using Pb-210 and (CS)-C-137. The cores were analyzed for total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), biogenic silica (BSi), loss-on-ignition (LOI), Cu, Zn, Al, Fe, Mn, K, Ca, Mg and Na. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the trends in the chemical variables and to compare the trends at the different sites. Applying the 1986 Cs-137 date as a reference point, Pb-210 chronologies were constructed for the sites using either the CRS model or a composite model (using both CIC and CRS). Significant increases were observed in sedimentation rates, TP and TN concentrations in all of the cores. Copper showed clear increases from 1850 towards present at all sites. Furthermore, redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to correlate environmental variables (catchment land use, catchment size, estuary surface area, depth and lake percentage) to sediment geochemistry. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), the percentage of agriculture in the catchment was the most important factor affecting the sediment accumulation rate. Urban land-use types and industry correlate well with sediment Cu and Ca concentrations. Forest areas were related to high sediment BSi concentrations. Catchment land use was the most significant factor affecting sediment geochemical composition and sediment accumulation rates in these coastal embayments. Our results demonstrate that the coastal estuaries of the Gulf of Finland respond to the increased nutrient loading with the increased sedimentation and nutrient accumulation rates.

AB  - This paper investigates the dynamic between protection of the historic environment and the application of solar energy technology on 1- or 2-family houses in Sweden. More specifically, the building code relating to the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels on house roofs and how existing policies are implemented in Stockholm City is investigated in order to better understand the challenges in reconciling renewables and the conservation of built heritage. Especially when applied in urban areas PV panels may have a large impact on socio-cultural values, making them difficult to insta where the historic environment is to be protected from large changes. By using a mix of methods (policy analysis, case studies, and interviews) we come to the conclusion that municipalities should develop routines and guidelines that offer homeowners precise information on the potential of solar energy and requirements motivated by concern for the historic environment. Guidelines that are well-known, clear and also require homeowners to dismount exhausted panels could work both to protect built heritage and to promote more use of solar energy in some small house areas.

AB  - Informed by the concept of diversity, this article discusses the issue of municipalities' facilitation of ethnic diversity and integration in two cities in northern Norway. Municipalities are in a position to accommodate ethnic diversity in more pragmatic ways than the nation-state through local policies. We explore diversity policies in three different areas: democratic participation, urban planning, and cultural policies. The study finds ambivalences in the involvement of immigrants in urban planning processes and to some degree indifference in planning for diversity but also real attempts at recognition by giving immigrants a voice in local politics.

AB  - This article asks whether regional integration affects socially sensitive policies, representative of the cultural idiosyncrasies of a country. It looks at Nordic (Finnish and Swedish) alcohol control policy and Dutch drug policy to explore this question. Second, it will evaluate the explanatory power of two competing approaches to European integration - state-centric theories and multilevel governance models - in addressing the case of diminishing cultural diversity. I conclude by noting that the real agent of change is the movement of goods and people and that neither state-centric nor multi-level governance models fully explain the cases of alcohol and drug policy. Rather, these two examples from three countries suggest that state officials are able to strike special deals with relevant EU institutions, but that such agreements cannot control the costs of increased mobility related to the success of the Single Market.

AB  - This paper examines an example of cultural conflict in the case of a whale tourism project in northern Norway. The project has caused conflict since foreign entrepreneurs and their sponsors have moved in with the explicit purpose of putting an end to whaling by various means of changing the whalers' and local people's conception about whales. It is argued in this paper that the reason behind the introduction of the project follows an increasing ideological trend in the Western world today: the non-consumptive utilization of whales. This idea rejects whales as a fishery resource in favour of developing an emotional and recreational relationship towards them and at the same time helping unemployed whalers. The entrepreneurs have thus tried to transform ''the Whale'' from within the traditional cultural context in northern Norway by introducing an alien image of it as something humans are only supposed to consume by non-material means. Finally, it is concluded that the entrepreneurs have not succeeded in changing either local attitudes towards whales or the economic situation for the whalers, since whaling and other coastal communities in northern Norway show a high degree of cultural resistance.

AB  - We describe the methodology applied in the 12th national forest inventory of Finland (NFI12) and describe the state of Finland's forests as well as the development of some key parameters since 1920s. According to the NFI12, the area of forestry land (consisting of productive and poorly productive forest, unproductive land, and other forestry land) is 26.2 M ha. The area of forestry land has decreased from 1920s to 1960s due to expansion of agriculture and built-up land. 20% of the forestry land is not available for wood supply and 13% is only partly available for wood supply. The area of peatlands is 8.8 M ha, which is one third of the forestry land. 53% of the current area of peatlands is drained. The volume of growing stock, 2500 M m(3), is 1.7 times the volume estimated in NFI1 in the 1920s for the current territory of Finland. The estimated annual volume increment is 107.8 M m(3). The increment estimate has doubled since the estimate of NFI2 implemented in late 1930s. The annual mortality is estimated to 7 M m(3), which is 0.5 M m(3) more than according to the previous inventory. Serious or complete damage was observed on 2% of the productive forest available for wood supply. The amount of dead wood is on average 5.8 m(3) ha(-1) in productive forests. Since the NFI9 (1996-2003) the amount of dead wood has increased in South Finland and decreased in North Finland both in protected forests and forests available for wood supply (FAWS). The area of natural or almost natural forests on productive forest is 380 000 ha, out of this, 42 000 ha are in FAWS and 340 000 ha in protected forests.

AB  - Biosphere Reserves aim at being role models for biodiversity conservation. This study focuses on the unsuccessful conservation of waders (Charadrii) on wet grasslands in the Kristianstad Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve (KVBR) in southern Sweden. Predation on nests and young has been proposed as one reason contributing to the decline of waders. We explored this hypothesis by comparing two landscapes, one with declining (KVBR) and one with stable (Ostergotland) wader populations on managed wet grasslands in southern Sweden. Specifically, we tested three predictions linked to predation on wader nests and young, namely that (1) the relative abundance of avian predators and waders; (2) the avian predator abundance; and (3) the predation rate on artificial wader nests, should all be higher in declining versus stable populations. All predictions were clearly supported. Nevertheless, predation may not be the ultimate factor causing wader population declines. We discuss the cumulative effects of landscape change linked to increased food resources for predators, reduced wet grassland patch size and quality. Holistic analyses of multiple wet grassland landscapes as social-ecological systems as case studies, including processes such as predation and other factors affecting waders, is a promising avenue towards collaborative learning for wet grasslands as a functional green infrastructure. However, if governance and management approaches can be improved is questionable without considerable investment in both ecological and social systems.

AB  - Although anthropogenic edges are an important consequence of timber harvesting, edges due to natural disturbances or landscape heterogeneity are also common. Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually <20m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests.Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.

AB  - Introduction Growth in urban areas has resulted in conflicts between road users as they share the roadway. Such conflicts are only exacerbated by failings in the planning process. The purpose of this study is to examine, through a case study in Trondheim, Norway, issues related to freight delivery on a street section with a high volume of cyclists in order to identify how and where urban freight should be addressed within the urban planning process.
   Methods The study consists of two parts: (1) a safety evaluation of the location through video recordings which identifies the risk areas associated with freight delivery and encounters with cyclists, and (2) a mapping of the planning process through semi-structured interviews in order to understand the development decisions involving a facility requiring deliveries and the surrounding streetscape.
   Results The safety analysis identified several risk areas mainly associated with the turning manoeuvres of trucks undertaken either before or after deliveries. The mapping of the planning process indicated that there were few to no discussions of freight deliveries during the planning, design and construction of the building; neither were there any for the streetscape projects taking place within the same time frame.
   Conclusions The absence of a dedicated freight policy and/or personnel at the governing authority, as well as lack of coordination amongst different plans (construction, street, thematic), are likely to lead to continued problematic and potentially dangerous environments such as that in the case study. Improvements to the Norwegian planning process, namely earlier integration of freight considerations, are required to ensure sustainable freight systems in the urban environment.

AB  - Recolonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of areas of extensive sheep breeding in the French Alps in the early 1990s led to intense conflicts over losses of domestic livestock. We used data on depredations and sheep herd management from 45 pastures of the Mercantour Mountains of the French Alps to build models of attack and kill rates and to quantify the efficiency of using livestock-guarding dogs and of gathering or confining herds at night to prevent damage. Efficiency of livestock-guarding dogs was lowest when sheep were ranging freely and highest when sheep were confined at night. The effect of livestock-guarding dogs on depredations was heterogeneous across pastures. When sheep were confined at night, presence of 3 to 4 dogs was predicted to prevent a large majority (> 95%) of kills that would have occurred in the absence of dogs for 81% of pastures. No effect of dogs was found for the other 19% of pastures. Confining or simply gathering sheep at night in the presence of 5 livestock-guarding dogs was predicted to prevent most kills (94% and 79%, respectively) that would have occurred in similar conditions but with free-ranging sheep. Efficiency of each of these 2 techniques was drastically reduced when they were not used jointly. This study suggested that confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs can prevent a large majority of livestock losses to wolves in the southern French Alps.

AB  - Pests often evolve resistance to pest controls used in agriculture and aquaculture. The rate of pest adaptation is influenced by the type of control, the selective pressure it imposes, and the gene flow between farms. By understanding how these factors influence evolution at the metapopulation level, pest management strategies that prevent resistance from evolving can be developed. We developed a model for the metapopulation and evolutionary dynamics of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which is a major parasite affecting salmon aquaculture. Different management scenarios were simulated across a network of salmon farms covering half of Norway, and their effects on louse epidemiology and evolution were investigated. We compared louse controls that differed in how they were deployed through time (discrete vs. continuous), how they impacted the louse life cycle, and in their overall efficacy. We adjusted the strength of selection imposed by treatments, the dominance effect of the resistant allele, and the geographic location at which resistance originated. Continuously acting strategies (e.g., louse-resistant salmon) were generally more effective than discrete strategies at controlling lice, especially when they increased louse mortality during early developmental stages. However, effective strategies also risked imposing frequent and/or strong selection on lice, thus driving rapid adaptation. Resistant alleles were more likely to be lost through genetic drift when they were recessive, had a low-fitness advantage, or originated in low-farm-density areas. The north-flowing current along the Norwegian coastline dispersed resistant genes from south to north, and limited gene flow in the opposite direction. We demonstrate how evolutionary models can produce quantitative predictions over large spatial and temporal scales and for a range of pest control scenarios. Quantitative outputs can be translated into practical management decisions applied at a regional level to minimise the risk of resistance developing.

AB  - Coastal reclamation is a major feature of contemporary land planning. As a multicomponent natural system, the coastal zone is impacted by various external processes (inundation, erosion, etc.) and land habitat demands an increased focus on anthropogenic activity. For the first time, a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) has been determined for the easternmost area of the Gulf of Finland (the Baltic Sea) (EGoF) in order to assess vulnerability of the coastal zone to erosion. The parameters for the CVI assessment were identified on the basis of existing field observations and analysis of environmental factors expressed in the EGoF. This research is focused on coastal segments prone to the rapid development of erosion, a subject highly relevant for coastal management. The CVI assessment, based on a method proposed by Gornitz (1991), uses seven physical parameters grouped according to geological, geomorphological, lithodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics. Storminess, or susceptibility to destructive storm events, was applied for the study area not only because of the global increase in storm activity but also because this area undergoes a "bay-effect". An experts' assessment distinguished the most crucial parameters that triggered the coastal erosion process, namely that coastal geology and the number of destructive storms affected coastal processes.

AB  - This paper explores the author's observations on the barriers, risks, and, to a greater extent, opportunities associated with natural amenity-led or recreation-led rural development in Norway, which others might term rural tourism. It seeks to establish an argument for a refocusing of rural amenity-led development away from traditional high-amenity areas and toward previously overlooked places, thus geographically and substantively broadening the potential for this type of development in Norway. This change in orientation seeks to avoid the tourism-dependence that has emerged and is similar to older forms of natural-resource extraction dependence. Finally, the paper presents two cultural contradictions of cuisine that constitute barriers to the proposed broader geographical and cultural development of recreation and tourism in rural Norway.

AB  - Ancestral tourism and amateur genealogy are popular phenomena, driving members of diasporas to reconnect with their ancestral roots and discover family histories. Tourism researchers have not yet paid much attention to Scandinavian countries as ancestral destinations. After waves of emigration, there are now millions of individuals with Scandinavian roots in countries like the United States. We explore the demand-side of American ancestral tourism to Sweden. Our findings stem from nine interviews with Swedish-Americans who have been ancestral tourists in Sweden. Ancestral tourists live highly emotional experiences dependent on factors occurring prior to and during travels and involving many sites and stakeholders beyond the control of the destination. Our study reveals the importance for ancestral tourists of establishing a network of allies through genealogy research for their experience in Sweden to be positive. The accumulation of family memories and of information gained through genealogy research makes ancestral travels to Sweden a highly personal endeavor, rather than an elusive reconnection to a distant heritage. Yet reconnecting with the ancestral homeland and establishing a sense of belonging to its society also matters to these tourists, though cultural stereotypes influence this experience. We conclude with recommendations for destination development and future research.

AB  - The term woodland key habitat (WKH) was launched in Sweden in 1990. Definitions for the concept have changed over the years, and today the WKH concept and its application are issues of debate in Sweden. Consequently, the Swedish Forestry Agency (SFA) initiated a collaborative process including forest stakeholders with the purpose to clarify the application and develop the inventory methodology of WKH. We have studied, by means of interviews and observations, participant perceptions of how endogenous and exogenous factors affect the collaborative process. During our research, we identified three game changers: the pause in WKH registration in northwestern Sweden that caused several participants to drop out of the process; budget allocations for new nationwide WKH inventories that put the process on hold; and formal instructions from the government that came nine months later and essentially re-initiated the collaborative process. Altogether, this not only affected the participants' abilities, understanding and willingness to participate, but also the overall legitimacy of the process - indicating the difficulty of conducting policy development in collaborative form, especially when it is highly politicized since it impact on the participants' anticipation of the process and its end results.

AB  - How representative are yields from experimental plots compared to large-scale commercial implementation? This study analyses the yields of fast-growing willow plantations for energy reported in experimental trials in Sweden during the period 1980-2012 compared with those from commercial willow plantations for the period 1986-2006. The study reviews 16 academic publications, which include 466 records from experimental plots, and records from 2073 commercial plantations across the country. The average yield recorded from experiments was 7.7 odt ha(-1) year(-1), compared to commercial plantations' yields 2.6 and 4.2 odt ha(-1) year(-1) for the first and second rotations, respectively. The measured area of the experimental plots seems to have an effect in the overestimation of the average yields, which can be attributed to extrapolation errors. In addition, to explain the broad differences between yield estimates, we identify the following as potential factors: near-optimal management practices and choice of land age differences and rotation lengths, edge effects, measurement methods, harvesting losses, increased mortality, and increased probability of hazard. The results can help to rationalize the expectations derived from experiments and to a more realistic planning of future plantation schemes.

AB  - In the contemporary so-called competition state era', many rural and peripheral regions are in decline. Tourism is increasingly viewed as being able to alleviate and rejuvenate regions that are facing economic difficulties. The European Union has launched several programmes with the goal of stimulating growth and employment in peripheral areas. These programmes are often used to support tourism development projects. In this paper, a longitudinal analysis of spatial changes in Swedish tourism is conducted. The analysis is based on statistics regarding overnight stays in Swedish commercial accommodation facilities. The aim is to investigate if tourism and tourism policy contribute to the reduction in disparities between regions. Although there are exceptions, the main findings indicate that the potential for creating sustainable rural tourism growth through tourism policy seems to be much less than the popular discourse suggests.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat loss and climate change are among the major threats to biodiversity. Bioclimatic zones such as the boreal and arctic regions are undergoing rapid environmental change, which will likely trigger changes in wildlife communities. Disentangling the effects of different drivers of environmental change on species is fundamental to better understand population dynamics under changing conditions. Therefore, in this study we investigate the synergistic effect of winter and summer weather conditions and habitat type on the abundance of 17 migratory boreal waterbird species breeding in Finland using three decades (1986-2015) of count data. We found that above-average temperatures and precipitations across the western and northern range of the wintering grounds have a positive impact on breeding numbers in the following season, particularly for waterbirds breeding in eutrophic wetlands. Conversely, summer temperatures did not seem to affect waterbird abundance. Moreover, waterbird abundance was higher in eutrophic than in oligotrophic wetlands, but long term trends indicated that populations are decreasing faster in eutrophic than in oligotrophic wetlands. Our results suggest that global warming may apparently benefit waterbirds, e.g. by increased winter survival due to more favourable winter weather conditions. However, the observed population declines, particularly in eutrophic wetlands, may also indicate that the quality of breeding habitat is rapidly deteriorating through increased eutrophication in Finland which override the climatic effects. The findings of this study highlight the importance of embracing a holistic approach, from the level of a single catchment up to the whole flyway, in order to effectively address the threats that waterbirds face on their breeding as well as wintering grounds.

AB  - When planning conservation and reintroductions of native species and control of invasive species, it is important to understand the environmental factors affecting species distributions. Habitat suitability largely determines where species can occur, but in addition to habitat and food resources, it is important to also consider human disturbance and climate when mapping possible distributions. We studied the environmental factors affecting the present distribution of the native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) and the invasive North American beaver (C. canadensis) in Finland. We compared the role of food resources, aquatic habitat type, anthropogenic disturbance and climate for beaver occurrence with species distribution models. We created maps of suitable areas for the two species and compared how the results would change if these two ecologically similar species were modelled together. We found that aquatic habitat type and climate largely explain the present distributions of the species. In addition, there were differences between the species in their preference for food resources, aspen, birch and grey alder. However, we suspect that the species' reintroduction history, i.e. the differences in the present environment, much explain the differences found between the species. We conclude that when planning possible reintroductions for the Eurasian beaver, factors other than food resources should also be considered. We also suggest that studies on habitat suitability should consider the history of the species and include data from different environments. Thus, more comprehensive information for management planning would be achieved and a better ability to predict the location of optimal areas for the species.

AB  - Norway claims to be the home of the aurora borealis. But other far-northern countries and states declare similar roles for themselves, both with respect to tourism and research. Common to all of these northern cultures, the aurora is commonly used as an icon to express identity. To understand how and why nations incorporate natural phenomena into identity, appeals to geography are not sufficient. In contrast to some of its neighbours that had long traditions for studying the northern lights, Norway first engaged the aurora forcefully around 1900. Through research and visual images polar scientist Fridtjof Nansen and physicist Kristian Birkeland helped transform the northern lights from a regional to a national icon, which in turn promoted further scientific investigations. This process was part of a broader development of a virile national identity that embraced engagement with polar nature. This essay sketches the cultural politics involved in launching the Norwegian auroral tradition.

AB  - The importance of social capital in sustainable development has recently been emphasized in the literature on regional and local development. Entrepreneurs are, by researchers as well as by politicians and policymakers, seen as central in creating local economic development. Organic agriculture is often expected to deliver several services to society, including environmentally friendly food production, thriving rural areas with small-scale farms, and increased biodiversity. However, the synergy effects of environmental entrepreneurs on local development and social sustainability are not well understood. Using semistructured interviews, this article analyzes entrepreneurs engaged in the production, processing and distribution of organic/biodynamic food in a rural Swedish community influenced by anthroposophy. One aim was to identify elements of what constitutes a sustainable community. A dynamic self-organized network of entrepreneurs characterized by economic stability and social capital was observed. The results indicate that the network of environmental entrepreneurs contributes to development in economical, social, and ecological terms. The key to success appeals to be a high level of trust and engagement, common norms, reciprocity between the entrepreneurs, and a stable demand from both households and the municipality.

AB  - Population-based studies of individual-level residential greenspace and mental health outcomes are still limited. Thus, the present study investigates greenspace-mental health associations-including depressive symptoms, burnout symptoms, and life satisfaction-in a population-based sample of adults, the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, in 2016 (n = 14,641). High-resolution land cover of greenspace and green-blue-space was assessed at 50, 100, 300 and 500 m buffers around residential addresses. Higher residential greenspace and green-blue-space were associated with lower levels of depressive and burnout symptoms among non-working individuals and with higher life satisfaction in the whole study population, after controlling for age, sex, individual income, and neighborhood socioeconomics. The immediate residential-surrounding environment (50 m) consistently showed the strongest associations with the outcomes. Having a partner was associated with better mental health outcomes and with having more residential greenspace, and adjusting for this rendered greenspace-health associations mostly statistically non-significant. In conclusion, higher levels of greenspace and green-blue-space in the immediate residential-surrounding environment were associated with better mental health outcomes in the present study, which contributes additional nuances to prior studies. The importance of residential greenspace for public health, urban planning, and development is discussed.

AB  - This article reviews the divergence of environmental regulatory arrangements in the Swedish forestry sector in relation to the closely-linked Swedish pulp and paper industry. The study finds that while the Swedish forestry sector was deregulated in 1993, with decreased state intervention in forest management, the pulp and paper sector has remained controlled by strong national mandatory requirements which have been further strengthened by European Union Directives after the 1990s. We suggest that one reason for the persistent, strict mandatory regulation of the pulp and paper sector is that conflicting goals between environmental protection and production growth have been aligned through technological change, while such a strong alignment of conflicting interests has not been possible to achieve in the forestry sector. Thus, policy divergence between the forestry and the pulp and paper industries may be explained by the success of established regulatory paths in the case of the pulp and paper industry, while in forestry deregulation has instead been used to, at least formally, increase focus on protection of the environment while maintaining a high level of productivity. Further studies in other sectors and countries will be necessary to clarify the specific role of, for example, discourses of deregulation and concepts of competitive advantage conceming e.g. particular actor's roles in specific elements of regulative change.

AB  - In forests, the amount and diversity of structural features with high value for biodiversity, such as large trees and dead wood, are affected by productivity, stand age, and forest management. For efficient conservation of forest biodiversity, it is essential to understand the combined effects of these drivers. We used data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to study the combined effects of productivity, stand age, and management for wood production on structures with high value for biodiversity: tree species richness, large living trees, dead wood volume, and specific dead wood types. Forest management changed the relationship between productivity and amount or diversity of some of the structures. Most structures increased with productivity and stand age, but decreased due to management. The negative effect of management was greatest for structures occurring mainly in high-productivity forests, such as deciduous dead wood. Thus, biodiversity conservation should target high-productivity forests to preserve these structures.

AB  - We quantified the intensity of nest predation in the curlew in two arable farmland areas in western Finland, as well as nest-site characteristics associated with nest predation using data on real nests (1995-1997) and artificial nests (1996). Predation on real curlew nests was consistently higher in the area of mixed farm/woodland than in the area of continuous farmland (64% ver-sits 5% of nests depredated, respectively). There was no evidence that any of the measured nest-site characteristics was associated with high risk of nest predation and, therefore, area differences in predation on curlew nests probably were due to differences in predator density and landscape structure between the two areas. Predation on artificial nests was far higher than on real nests (79% versus 31% of nests depredated, respectively), but there was no difference in nest losses between areas. In both areas, the likelihood of predation on artificial nests was highest in the vicinity of forest edges. The majority of identified predators on real nests were mammals, whereas those on artificial nests were birds. As a result, we were unable to use artificial nests to estimate the threat of predation or to reliably identify factors related to predation risk on real nests in this study.

AB  - Forest management regimes dictate the composition and structure of large parts of the Fennoscandian boreal forest region. The understanding of thinning impacts on understorey plant communities is considerably lower compared to the effects of final felling. We studied the response of bryophyte assemblages to second commercial thinning in spruce-dominated stands sampled to be representative of the dominant forest type of south-central Sweden. Eighteen stands were analysed 6-12 years after second commercial thinning, and were compared with six stands commercially thinned only once, at two spatial scales (0.1 and 0.01ha), with stand ages varying between 52 and 66 years. We found few strong differences in bryophyte species richness and no differences in bryophyte species composition between stands thinned once or twice. More pioneer species were found in stands thinned only once, a result that needs further study. Species richness declined significantly with time since thinning on both investigated spatial scales. Canopy cover significantly affected the composition of forest floor species. Thinning effects over longer time periods need further study, and also effects in different forest types along productivity gradients. For nature conservation, studies targeted towards thinning response of uncommon species connected to specific habitats and substrates will be essential.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the direct effects of anthropogenic deforestation on simulated climate at two contrasting periods in the Holocene, similar to 6 and similar to 0.2 k BP in Europe. We apply We apply the Rossby Centre regional climate model RCA3, a regional climate model with 50 km spatial resolution, for both time periods, considering three alternative descriptions of the past vegetation: (i) potential natural vegetation (V) simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, (ii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land use (deforestation) from the HYDE3.1 (History Database of the Global Environment) scenario (V + H3.1), and (iii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land use from the KK10 scenario (V + KK10). The climate model results show that the simulated effects of deforestation depend on both local/regional climate and vegetation characteristics. At similar to 6 k BP the extent of simulated deforestation in Europe is generally small, but there are areas where deforestation is large enough to produce significant differences in summer temperatures of 0.5-1 degrees C. At similar to 0.2 k BP, extensive deforestation, particularly according to the KK10 model, leads to significant temperature differences in large parts of Europe in both winter and summer. In winter, deforestation leads to lower temperatures because of the differences in albedo between forested and unforested areas, particularly in the snow-covered regions. In summer, deforestation leads to higher temperatures in central and eastern Europe because evapotranspiration from unforested areas is lower than from forests. Summer evaporation is already limited in the southernmost parts of Europe under potential vegetation conditions and, therefore, cannot become much lower. Accordingly, the albedo effect dominates in southern Europe also in summer, which implies that deforestation causes a decrease in temperatures. Differences in summer temperature due to deforestation range from -1 degrees C in south-western Europe to +1 degrees C in eastern Europe. The choice of anthropogenic land-cover scenario has a significant influence on the simulated climate, but uncertainties in palaeoclimate proxy data for the two time periods do not allow for a definitive discrimination among climate model results.

AB  - Peatlands are globally important ecosystems that reflect many of today's environmental challenges, particularly climate change and biodiversity loss. In recent years, several European countries have adopted national peatland strategies as integrated strategies that provide cross-sectoral policy frameworks to promote the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of peatlands. This paper reviews eight national peatland strategies that have been formally adopted in Europe, i.e., the peatland strategies of Austria, England, Germany, Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The strategies are analyzed based on six key themes: (1) the motivation for adopting national peatland strategies, (2) the generation of a sufficient database, (3) stakeholder participation and outreach, (4) institutional arrangements for cross-sectoral policy coordination and integration, (5) financial management strategies, and (6) mechanisms for monitoring and reporting. Our comparative study shows that there is a growing political commitment to sustainable peatland management in Europe. Although the national strategies show some differences in terms of the six key themes, they also show a high degree of similarity in terms of procedural aspects and the issues addressed. We conclude that the national strategies are currently performing quite well in terms of raising awareness and building capacity. However, the main challenge for the effective implementation of national peatland strategies is the issue of cross-sectoral policy integration.

AB  - To better understand current conflicts related to human-wolf interactions in Finland, this article undertakes a longue-duree examination of societal structural transformations and how they have influenced ways of relating to nature in the country. Through a world-ecological perspective, we weave together a historical review and results of ethnographic fieldwork to explain how and why human-wolf relations in Finland transformed from indifferent coexistence to purposeful eradication in the late 19th century and ultimately to contemporary contested protection. We argue that the nature-making capacities of capitalist development are an integral part of the historical circumstances that led to the eradication of wolves, which was not only the result of animosity towards wolves but also fuelled by the interests of elite hunters. The resulting negative perceptions, coupled with changes in practices and landscapes during the wolf-less era, are central in current contestations, illustrating the deep ideological, emotional, and practical nature relations that capitalism creates.

AB  - Competing discourses of the forest guide forest-owners' ideas about the proper forest use and about the need to conserve biodiversity. In this paper, we examine how five predefined forest discourses (re)produced by Finnish forest owners treat nature and biodiversity conservation. Our critical discourse analysis combines qualitative content analysis with quantitative multivariate methods (NMDS). The data consists of in-depth interviews with 24 Finnish forest-owners. The five forest discourses formed a gradient from an absence of nature issues to a profound ecological pondering with deep affection and responsibility for nature. The discourses in between these two ends of the gradient contained narration on personal experiences but lacked the moral responsibility and deep theorizing typical of the nature-oriented discourse. The nature-oriented discourse proposed forest uses where the needs of nature were raised to a determining role whereas the other four discourses adhered to the standard economy-driven forest management paradigm. Both nature and the forest-owners with a strong relationship with nature appeared marginalised in the prevailing order of the forest discourses. The discoursal conditions that we evidenced did not favour biodiversity conservation among forest-owners. The results thus call for active forest policy that aims to transform the prevailing order of the discourses, but also tries to overcome the discoursal hinders for biodiversity conservation within the prevailing order.

AB  - Parking management and planning can be used to address several issues related to sustainable urban development. For example, parking availability affects both car ownership and usage, and parking planning can affect both land use and building costs. A tool used in several countries is minimum parking requirements (MPR) and lowering these could be a pathway to more sustainable mobility. However, the actual effects of lower MPR have not systematically been studied. In this paper we present the results of a review of sixteen developments with low MPR in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK. Existing research and reports have been analyzed to compare these and draw conclusions on the effect of MPR on mobility patterns and mobility services. In addition, interviews were conducted with representatives from municipalities and developers. Our results indicate that the mobility patterns of individuals in the studied projects are more sustainable than in nearby projects. However, the causality of MPR and mobility is hard to establish due to the risk of self-selection and that all of the studied projects have good prerequisites for sustainable mobility practices. Many of the studied evaluations are also of poor quality with, for example, lack of appropriate control group.

AB  - The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) with the two models REVEALS and LOVE is developed to transform pollen percentage data to vegetation cover. This paper presents the first study to evaluate LRA in a region with large topographic variations within a short distances. The REVEALS model estimates regional vegetation abundance based on pollen assemblages from large lakes (100-500 ha). Pollen surface samples from one large and 28 small lakes are used together with a combination of regionally derived pollen productivity estimates and available estimates from other regions of Europe. The results show a good relationship between REVEALS-estimated forest cover and vegetation abundance based on the CORINE land-cover data. The REVEALS results using various sets of pollen assemblages from small lakes were comparable to those using one large lake. Local vegetation abundance using the LOVE model was estimated around 26 lakes. For common taxa, such as Pinus and Poaceae, the LOVE-based estimates of plant abundance match well with the distance-weighted plant abundances based on vegetation maps. Our results indicate that the LRA approach is effective for reconstruction of long-term vegetation changes in western Norway and other regions with high topographic relief when no major gradients exist in the pollen data.

AB  - This article takes its point of departure from research debates about how waterfront regeneration projects are rooted in urban entrepreneurial governance that involves local boosterism and high demands on management of funding and financial risks. The empirical study investigates two second-tier cities in Sweden. The study illustrates that the projects for the two cities are managed in quite different ways. This confirms the importance of recognizing that urban processes are conditioned by the local configuration of actors and practices. The concluding discussion also emphasizes the multi-layer structure of the public sector. It is suggested that the quite uneven distribution of national infrastructure investment is detrimental to the potential of wider development effects of waterfront generation projects for second-tier cities. Thus, although this article shows that the model for large-scale waterfront regeneration projects is on one level viable for cities on the second-tier level of city systems, it must be remembered that the effects on the wider urban development may diverge from the effects of such investments for first-tier and larger urban centres.

AB  - The aim of the present research is to analyse the key land use indicators for six countries of the Baltic Sea region in order to identify the size of agricultural area needed for earning a minimum income in the main agricultural sectors. It is important that land resources are managed both sustainably and efficiently, producing agricultural products and generating revenue. The present research analysed the indicators of land use and labour productivity for crop, dairy and grazing livestock farms in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Finland and Sweden. The research found that in the European Union, the average agricultural area per farm was the largest in crop farming, while the highest average labour consumption was specific to dairy farming, which was the most profitable industry as well. However, significant disparities among the countries exist concerning the indicators analysed, and Latvia's farms have to considerably increase their labour productivity both in crop farming and in dairy farming, while high indicators were achieved in grazing livestock farming.

AB  - Norway's preserved 28 medieval stave churches are often recognised as the country's most significant contribution to world cultural heritage. Their wooden architecture and carvings are vulnerable both from a technical conservation and heritage point of view. With increasing visitor numbers, the wear and tear of the stave churches has received attention during the last couple of years, yet there have been no attempts to map the consequences. This paper builds on the results from an ongoing project which aims to map that arrive with an increased volume of visitors in the stave churches. A unique collection of visitor statistics and results from a questionnaire is presented, as well as a closer look at the case study church of Gol outside of Oslo. The paper also discusses the potential of different monitoring techniques as a step to improve the basis of strategic decision making, improve day-to-day management routines, and identify preventive measures and technical solutions that can and mitigate material loss.

AB  - Large-scale oil spills can have adverse effects on biodiversity in coastal areas where maritime oil transportation is intense. In this article we conducted a spatial risk assessment to study the risk that potential tanker accidents pose to threatened habitat types and species living in the northern Baltic Sea, which has witnessed a rapid increase in maritime oil transportation within the past two decades. We applied a probabilistic method, which combines three components: a Bayesian network describing tanker accidents and uncertainties related to them, probabilistic maps showing the movement of oil, and a database of threatened species and habitats in the area. The results suggest that spatial risk posed by oil spills varies across the area, and does not correspond, for example, to the frequency of accidents in a given area. The relative risk is highest for seashore meadows, which is important to take into account when managing these habitats. Our analysis underlines the importance of a thorough risk assessment, which is not only based solely on one or two specific factors such as accident probabilities or the trajectories of spilled oil but also contains as broad a view of the consequences as possible. We believe that the probabilistic methodology applied in the study will be of high interest to people who have to cope with uncertainties typical for environmental risk assessment and management.

AB  - The use of intensive forestry on part of the forested area in Sweden increases the production of forest biomass and enables an increased use of such biomass to mitigate climate change. However, with increasing conflicting interests in forests and forestry, the success of such a strategy depends on the public acceptance. In this paper, the results of a mail survey show that although a majority of the general public in Sweden supports measures to increase forest growth, they oppose the use of intensive forestry practices such as the cultivation of exotic tree species, clones, and forest fertilization. The acceptance of such practices is mainly influenced by the perceptions of their environmental consequences. Public acceptance was highest for forest fertilization, whereas clone cultivation was the least accepted practice.

AB  - We studied the effects of restoration on water-table depth (WTD), element concentrations of peat and vegetation composition of peatlands drained for forestry in southern Finland. The restoration aimed to return the trajectory of vegetation succession toward that of undisturbed systems through the blockage of ditches and the removal of trees. Permanent plots established on a bog and a fen were sampled 1 year before, and 1, 2, 3, and 10 years after the restoration. The restoration resulted in a long-term rise of the water-table in both peatlands. Ten years after restoration, the mineral element concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, Mn, and P) of peat corresponded to those reported from comparable pristine peatlands. In particular, the increase of K and Mn concentrations at both sites suggests the recovery of ecosystem functionality in terms of nutrient cycling between peat and plants. The restoration resulted in the succession of plant communities toward the targeted peatland vegetation of wetter condition at both sites. This was evident from the decreased abundance of species benefiting from drainage and the corresponding increase of peatland species. However, many species typical of pristine peatlands were missing 10 years after restoration. We conclude that the restoration led to a reversal of the effects of drainage in vegetation and studied habitat conditions. However, due to the slow recovery of peatland ecosystems and the possibility that certain failures in the restoration measures may become apparent only after extended time periods, long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the goals of restoration will be met.

AB  - To provide input to sewage sludge management strategies that address expected new regulations in terms of hygienisation and phosphorus recovery in Sweden, an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) was made. The LCA identified environmental hot spots for methods that may permit sludge or phosphorus from sludge to be applied on agricultural land. In particular, thermophilic digestion, pasteurisation, thermal hydrolysis, urea treatment and mono-incineration with phosphorus recovery were compared. In addition, a sludge management system involving drying of sludge before use in forestry was investigated. The results showed that some major impacts are related to large uncertainties, such as those related to emissions from sludge storage. It also showed that large gains can be achieved when products from the systems replace other products, in particular when biogas is used to replace natural gas in vehicles, but also when sludge is used in agriculture and forestry. In general, there are small differences between the sludge management methods. Retaining the sludge matrix to allow for its utilisation in agriculture may conflict with keeping emissions to air and water from the sludge matrix low. It is recommended that any sludge management option minimises emissions from sludge to air and water and that resources are recovered and used, in line with the principles of a circular economy.

AB  - The article considers little-known pages of the history of the Russian-Norwegian borderland (Northern Frontier), a comprehensive picture of migration processes, and the ethnocultural landscape of the Northern Frontier in the chronological framework of the 18th. early 19th centuries. The main sources are the archives of Russia and Norway: the Archive of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire, the State Military Historical Archive, the State Archive of the Arkhangelsk Region, the National Archive of Norway in Oslo and the State Archive of Norway in Tromso. The results of the study reveal a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary development of the Russian-Norwegian borderland from the zone with a frontier configuration to a territory with well-defined political boundaries, and substantially supplement the interpretation model of the delimitation process of the Northern Frontier at the end of the 18th. beginning of the 19th centuries.
   An analysis of archival sources showed that the territory of the Russian-Norwegian borderland (Nyavdema, Paatsjoki and Pechengsky pogosts) prior to the 18th century was inhabited mainly by the Russian Orthodox Sami-Skolts. Since the 18th century, Danish-Norwegian subjects of the Varanger group. the montane and sea Sami and Norwegian colonists gradually settled this area.
   Seasonal fishing migrations of the Varanger Sami in the Skolt pogosts were typical for the economic life of the Sami borderland communes, but the nature of commercial migrations in the 18th century qualitatively changed. Montane and sea Sami gradually replaced their seasonal fishing migrations to permanent stay in the Skolt territories, expanding the areas of fishing activities. The transition to settlement colonization was caused by the crisis of extensive reindeer breeding of the Varanger Sami and the policy of Finnish officials who encouraged the settlement of the Russian Sami territories.
   Thus, the change of the migration nature, the expansion of fishing activities by Danish-Norwegian subjects, and the Skolt's failure to control their own territory led to a change in the ethnocultural landscape of the Northern Frontier. The Norwegian presence in the disputed territory was intensified; the involvement of the civil administration of Russia and Denmark-Norway in the resolution of trade disputes between subjects of both states in the late 18th and early 19th centuries increased. These facts eventually became the formal foundation for the delimitation process of the Northern Frontier in the 1820s.

AB  - Pure and even-aged (PEA) forests of fast-growing conifer species have for a long time been key providers of industrial raw material. Despite recent concerns regarding their greater sensitivity to major natural disturbances, their impacts on biodiversity and their funding efficiency, PEA conifer forests could remain a major economic target given the ongoing European strategy for bioeconomy. These forests are encountered in contrasted climates and in both native and introduced contexts across Europe, giving rise to high uncertainties regarding their growth responses to current climate change. Using the French National Forest Inventory data, we studied the radial growth of eight major conifer species in European forestry across 16 regional native and introduced PEA forest systems (n > 10 000 trees). Growth trends over the 2006-2016 period exhibited a significant negative association with the absolute growth level in 2006, with the strongest negative growth trends found for emblematic PEA forestry species (e.g. Norway spruce and Douglas fir), and the strongest positive trends for pine species (e.g. Scots pine). While the greater growth rate advantage of some species may shorten rotation and lower risk exposures for future decades, their recent lowered productivity may affect the forest sector in the long run. The prevalence of PEA forests across European forest landscapes and their increasingly reported lower resilience to climate change compared to more complex forest systems call for the establishment of a long-term European forest policy strategy. Maintaining the environmental, social and economic benefits of forests should remain a priority in the European agenda, regardless of the financial costs at stake.

AB  - In regions with a long cultural history, past land-use may strongly determine floristic composition in seemingly natural vegetation. Here we examine if past land-use affects understory plant distribution in near-natural forest in a historically and environmentally heterogeneous setting, namely the 17 ha freshwater island of Borgo (Denmark). In 107 randomly located 100 m(2) plots we recorded species composition and various environmental variables. The plots were classified into three groups according to past land-use: (1) Disturbed sites close to 12(th) and 20(th) century ruins and associated open areas; (2) formerly grazed meadow areas; and (3) forested sites without indications of strong anthropogenic influence. Past land-use, environmental variables and species traits were used to interpret floristic gradients. Unconstrained and constrained ordinations clearly separated plots with different past land-use, and showed that the main floristic gradients on Borgo correlated with hydrological-edaphic conditions and past land-use. Partial constrained ordination using the environmental parameters as covariables showed that past land-use had a unique influence on floristic composition.

AB  - This study explores the local municipality as an important arena for developing and implementing initiatives for a transition to long-term sustainable development. It focuses on institutional conditions that support the integration of 'radical', transition-oriented perspectives and ideas (i.e. perspectives stressing the need for changed social power relations and 'other' norms and visions for the future,) in local governance, with a specific focus on small municipalities. Inspired by transition literature and theory on institutional capacity, the paper explores frames of reference, relational resources, and mobilisation capacity. Empirically, the paper builds on research in two small municipalities in Sweden, where we studied documents on policy for local development, and energy and land-use planning, and carried out qualitative interviews with politicians, planners, and actors from local industry and civil society. The study provides a rich empirical illustration of specific conditions that affect the possibilities to work with transition oriented perspectives in small municipalities.

AB  - Land bird densities in roadside habitats were studied in 17 locations in central Finland by the line transect method. Two transects were censused in each location. The first transect was situated 25 m from highway edge and the second transect 200 m away from the first one. The results suggested that land bird density was lower closer to highways. Species that avoided the road included willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), crossbills (Loxia spp.), and tree pipit (Anthus trivialis). The composition of the bird community did not vary significantly between the compared transects. Some species appeared to favour road-forest edges but this could not be confirmed with our data. These species were not the same as have been reported to favor clear-fellings-mature forest edges. Therefore, the edge effect does not seem to be the most important factor controlling relative bird densities immediately adjacent and further away from highways. The likelihood of avoiding the problems the highways are causing for bird density are been discussed.

AB  - Key message Norway spruce seed has been traded extensively for at least three centuries throughout the natural distribution range in Europe and beyond. However, our knowledge about these transfers is limited. Historic data are essential tools to trace back human-mediated gene flow and for interpretation of recent genetic studies.
   Context Human-mediated gene flow can potentially have a major impact on the genetic composition of forest tree populations, yet our knowledge about seed sources used within the current species' range is still limited. Norway spruce is one of the most important coniferous species in European forestry, and data drawing conclusions about the genetic composition of current populations are vital with regard to gene conservation and sustainable forest management. Because molecular data are not available on a more detailed scale, historic records provide crucial information about translocations.
   Aims Our aim is to provide the first pan-European review on Norway spruce translocations from the seventeenth until the twentieth century.
   Methods We analysed historic and recent literature compiling information on the cultivation and transfer of Norway spruce reproductive material. Historic records are compared with recent molecular studies.
   Results Seed exchanges have profoundly altered the native genetic population structure of Norway spruce. Especially, Central European seeds have been used throughout and beyond the natural distribution area. Figures illustrating the historic plantings in Europe are provided.
   Conclusion Recent molecular data reveal persisting effects of past translocations. Historical records can be extremely useful for providing information about autochthony and thus guide gene conservation strategies and explain the performance of extant populations.

AB  - Nutrient losses to surface waters have been monitored at the small agricultural catchment scale (2-35 km(2)) for 20 years in Sweden. Eight of the 21 catchments have been more intensively monitored, with flow-proportional stream water sampling, analysis of groundwater quality, yearly crop management surveys and soil characterisation. Annual losses of total nitrogen (N) at catchment stream outlet vary from 6 to 32 kg ha(-1), with the largest losses from sandy loam soils in south-west Sweden, where precipitation is high. Losses of total phosphorus (P) vary from 0.1 to 2.0 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and are largest in catchments with clay soils. Compared with surrounding agricultural areas, crop production is more intensive in most of the monitoring catchments, e.g. the production of annual crops for the market constitutes a larger share of arable land than production of ley in 15 out of 21 monitoring catchments. A more intensive crop production is a consequence of a preference for a high proportion of arable land in the monitoring area which coincides with more productive agricultural areas in the regions. Knowing how the catchments relate to other agricultural areas is important when the catchments are used as indicators of agricultural impacts on surface waters. For detection of the success of implemented mitigation measures, small monitoring catchments are suitable since the response on stream water quality is faster than in larger river catchments where the contribution from other sources is larger and retention in streams and lakes occurs to a larger extent. The catchment information also enhances validation of models used for estimating losses of nutrients from other agricultural areas where information on crops, soils and climate exist but data on agricultural management and water quality is scarce.

AB  - Europe has a large tradition of Small Hydropower stations (SHP); these proliferate wherever there was an adequate supply of moving water and a need for electricity. As electricity demand grew many of these plants were abandoned. Today with the rising price of energy, SHP can be a solution to help rural electrification, furthermore SHPs do not consume the water that drives the turbines. The advantage of this technology is extremely robust and systems can last for 50 years or more with little maintenance. This paper summarizes an overview of SHP Hydropower in Europe. Hydropower on a small scale, or micro-hydro, is one of the most cost effective energy technologies to be considered for rural electrification in less developed countries. Europe is a market leader of SHP technology. Optimal turbine designs are available and new technical developments offer automated operation of SHP. The present role of SHP in Europe in the development of renewable energy sources is discussed through this paper. The main producers of SHP electricity in Europe are Italy, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden. On the other hand, 10 European countries are ranked based on the total numbers of SHPs: Germany (7,512), Italy (2,427), France (1,935), Sweden (1,901), Spain (1,047), Poland (722), Romania (274), Portugal (155) and UK (120). The research shows that there is a considerable scope for development and optimization of this technology. This opens new perspectives because it has a huge, as yet untapped potential in most areas of Europe and can make a significant contribution to future energy needs.

AB  - Forests are an important natural resource in Sweden. They are used for multiple purposes, for example, providing economic returns from timber harvest, conservation of biodiversity, provision of wild berries and mushrooms and recreational benefits. People's perceptions of forests and forest use are currently under transformation due to drivers like globalization and urbanization. The aim of this study was to analyse in particular Swedish university student's visions of future forests using a newly developed survey method based on mind mapping. An online survey with mind map technique was used to collect data from university students in Umea, northern Sweden. The study focused on features of forests, products derived from forests and activities in forests. The results indicate that students regard ecological, social and economic aspects of forests as important for future forests and the use of them. In particular, the role of non-wood forest products, like berries and mushrooms, as well as recreational features of forests were central to many of the students. The multitude of different visions suggests that forest management decisions of today, directing the future of forests, need to consider the multiple use of forests to be able to satisfy forest preferences also of younger generations.

AB  - In many European areas, recent transitions in rural development can be described as a shift from an emphasis on food production to a diversity of new forms of natural resource utilisation. This shift towards post-productivism is characteristic to many coastal areas, where commercial fisheries try to adapt their strategies with other activities, interests and ideologies, such as the protection of biodiversity, leisure use and tourism. This article analyses opportunities and governance arrangements that support commercial fishers' adaptation within a post-productivist setting, focusing on the Archipelago Sea region in southwest Finland. Relying on interview, survey and documentary material, the case-study recognises new forms of multifunctional activities that enhance the viability and resilience of coastal communities and also deliver benefits to the environmental and leisure sectors.

AB  - As the impact of green space shrinkage in urban centers becomes obvious, local and regional authorities must adopt environmental planning policies that can help create new green areas to ensure a good quality of life for citizens, along with the rehabilitation of the natural environment. One approach is the promotion of green infrastructure on buildings, including multi-dwelling apartment buildings. In order to effectively promote green infrastructure on buildings, it is essential to comprehend public attitudes toward green infrastructure, so that suitable and effective strategies can be implemented by policy makers. In this study, eight hundred respondents were asked to provide their views on green infrastructure on buildings, on construction that should take place on blocks of apartments in order to accommodate green infrastructure and on the related benefits that may arise from creating green spaces on buildings. A structured questionnaire and stratified sampling were used for the interviews, which were conducted with apartment owners in two regional units of Athens. The results showed that most citizens are willing to proceed with the installation of a green roof, trellis or vertical garden, in order to improve the aesthetics and functionality of the building they live in. Most of the respondents are not familiar with the energy savings that may occur from the installation of a green roof, vertical trellis or garden and wish for a subsidy from the state in order to implement green building solutions. To conclude, the participants in our study are not environmentally aware, since they are not interested in energy conservation but only about the aesthetics of their building; furthermore, they expect to receive financial support from the state in order to make any changes to their home.

AB  - A method was developed to construct maps of former forest types based on regional pollen data in southern Sweden. The considered species were Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Fagus, Fraxinus, Juniperus, Picea, Pinus, Populus, Quercus, Salix, Tilia and Ulmus. A network of 37 regional pollen sites with high data quality from lakes and peat deposits were selected from Sweden south of 60 degrees N. Pollen percentage values were calculated and converted into estimates of tree composition. For controling the reliability of the reconstruction, the estimates from the core-tops were compared with present day forest inventory data, and local pollen diagrams were compared with the regional pollen diagrams. An inverse distance weighted interpolation algorithm was used to generate maps for each tree species distribution at 2000 BP, 1500 BP, 1000 BP 500 BP and 0 BP. A supervised classification routine was implemented to generate nine different forest types common to the five studied time intervals. The maps show that the amounts and patterns of distribution of the species and the forest types have varied in a significant but systematic manner through time. The changes are due to human activities, migrational patterns and changes in climate. These maps will be of value as a basis for future landscape planning, forestry and conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Snowmobiling growth in North America and Sweden creates challenges in "governing the commons." Snowmobiling contributes to the economy of distressed rural regions and enhances residents' quality of life; but quasi-open access to winter landscapes also breeds conflicts: among snowmobilers, with landowners, with other recreationists, and with environmentalists and ecosystem health. Common pool resource and impure public goods theories are used to interpret these conflicts and strategic interactions. Case studies in Sweden and Maine yield insights about conditions for sustainable management of multiple-use landscapes when property rights are complex and stakeholders diverse. The case studies utilize key informant interviews, tourist surveys, and a contingent valuation exercise to illustrate how innovative governance institutions, complemented by infrastructure investments, can mitigate conflicts, re-align incentives, and internalize costs. Local self-governance has evolved with state facilitation, but without changes in fundamental property law. Three keys are trail agreements between snowmobile clubs and landowners, clubs' norm formation and rule enforcement, and public-private investment in quality trails. These arrangements are strained by hot spot congestion, free riding, and unresolved conflicts with other recreationists. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The notion of quiet areas has received increasing attention within the EU in recent years. The EU Environmental Noise Directive (END) of 2002 stipulates that member states should map existing quiet areas and formulate strategies to keep these quiet. Quiet areas could play an important role in balancing densified urban development by ensuring access to relative quietness and associated health benefits. This paper reports on a recent study investigating how the notion of quiet areas has been implemented in Sweden. The study, initiated by the Sound Environment Center in 2017, was carried out in two phases. In phase one, an overview of the current situation was obtained by scrutinizing regional and municipal mapping initiatives, aided by a short digital questionnaire sent out to all 290 municipalities in Sweden. This provided a general understanding and highlighted initiatives for further study in phase two. The results revealed that 41% (n = 118) of Sweden's municipalities include quiet areas in their general plans, but that significantly fewer of these have sophisticated strategies for implementation (n = 16; 6%). Moreover, the interest in quiet areas in municipalities does not seem to be directly related to the END, but is instead inspired by previous regional initiatives in Sweden. The study highlights a number of considerations and examples of how quiet areas are approached in Sweden today. In general, Sweden has come a long way in terms of identifying and mapping quiet areas, but more progress is needed in developing strategies to protect, maintain, and publicize quiet areas.

AB  - This paper investigates changes in decision-makers' attitudes toward environmentally sustainable urban development in selected Norwegian urban settlements between 1991 and 2020. Changes in general environmental attitudes, problem perceptions and policy preferences concerning urban development are analyzed based on a survey conducted three decades apart in the same case areas among similar samples of decision-makers. The results show a general picture of some mainstreaming of environmental concern, environmentally friendly attitudes and positive attitudes toward measures supporting nature and climate friendly urban development. At the same time, there has been an increased divide between the political left and the political right in their attitudes toward environmental issues in general, as well as toward environmentally sustainable urban development. The results point to a widening gap between environmental attitudes and problem perceptions on the one hand, and the physical reality of escalating crises in the natural world.

AB  - In the Norwegian Public Roads Administrations (NPRA) R&D program "Climate and Transportation" the main goal is to improve planning, design, operation and maintenance of the road network in Norway in order to adapt to future climate changes. This implies to come up with recommendations and to develop revised guidelines to cope with a changed climate based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and Norwegian climate research (RegClim). One of the tasks is to investigate the effect of a changed climate on gravel roads, which is described in this paper. This task will be dealing with analyses of pavement condition, estimation of changes in maintenance costs and proposal for actions to cope with negative consequences of a changed climate. There are limited data available on gravel roads in Norway; hence, a survey in all the NPRA regions was carried out. Pavement and drainage condition data, current maintenance methods, maintenance costs, and intervals where collected and analyzed. The results were used together with the estimated change in climate to do some preliminary estimation for rehabilitation and maintenance needs and the corresponding maintenance costs.

A postal questionnaire survey of drivers was carried out in Britain, Finland and The Netherlands. Exploratory factor analysis together with target (Procrustes) rotation and factorial agreement indexes were calculated to investigate the applicability of Finnish and Dutch versions of DBQ. Results of the factor comparisons showed that the DBQ four-factor structures found in Finland and The Netherlands were congruent but not perfect with the target structure found in Britain. Reliabilities of the scales were around the same level as in the British data. In addition to the four first-order factors, two second-order factors (deliberate violations and unintentional errors) were found in all three countries which supports the original structure by Reason et al. [Ergonomics 33 (1990) 1315]. Issues related to cross-cultural use of traffic behaviour questionnaires are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The interesting program involved thoroughfares designated for road vehicles, bringing about the recovery of the epic sense of car road trips, access to remote spots, and sustainable enhancement of their value. Many of the projects were carried out by young Norwegian architectural and landscaping teams trained at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO) under the influence of Knut Knutsen, Christian Norberg Schulz, and Svere Fehn. Through analysis, the objective of the research is to unravel the links between these landscape projects and the thought of the AHO masters.

AB  - Inscription onto UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites is an important way of drawing international attention to the legacy left by centuries of military and naval activity - brownfields par excellence. Three dockyards (government shipyards) are already so designated - in Karlskrona in Sweden, Suomenlinna in Finland and Venice - as part of the broader inscription of the city. Rochefort in southwest France and Chatham in southeast England are candidates, and Portsmouth Harbour, the Isle of Wight and Spithead might be the first 'cultural seascape' to be so inscribed.
   Each country maintains a tentative list of candidates for world heritage status, usually controlled by the ministry of culture. One entry per year is put forward by member countries for ICOMOS, UNESCO's advisory body to consider for inscription. To be accepted sites have to meet tests of authenticity, prepare a justification and supporting nomination dossier and ultimately have a management plan for safeguarding their future.
   The process of application requires considerable local commitment: viable management plans over a ten year period must be drawn up by local authorities, site owners and other stakeholders. These requirements reflect increasing concern that inscription is not enough in itself to guarantee protection of these very specialised brownfields from decay or overdevelopment. World Heritage Sites may be placed on the list of sites in danger if there is damaging change. This paper examines the extent to which inscription safeguards these unusual brownfields.

AB  - An effective rodent control program includes a team approach with centralized management and accountability. Environmental factors, the behavior of people, and the capability of organizations (government, businesses, and communities) must be evaluated when a rodent control program is designed. There must be excellent resources for community outreach, regulatory enforcement, and data management. Personnel must have technical skills and the ability to work with people. The program team should include several municipal organizations, each with defined responsibilities and communication structure. The pest control, landscaping, restaurant, and solid waste industries must be integrated into the program. Sustainability, cost-containment, and success ultimately are predicated on diverse community involvement.

AB  - Long-term observational studies conducted at large (regional) spatial scales contribute to better understanding of landscape effects on population and evolutionary dynamics, including the conditions that affect long-term viability of species, but large-scale studies are expensive and logistically challenging to keep running for a long time. Here, we describe the long-term metapopulation study of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) that has been conducted since 1991 in a large network of 4000 habitat patches (dry meadows) within a study area of 50 by 70km in the angstrom land Islands in Finland. We explain how the landscape structure has been described, including definition, delimitation, and mapping of the habitat patches; methods of field survey, including the logistics, cost, and reliability of the survey; and data management using the EarthCape biodiversity platform. We describe the long-term metapopulation dynamics of the Glanville fritillary based on the survey. There has been no long-term change in the overall size of the metapopulation, but the level of spatial synchrony and hence the amplitude of fluctuations in year-to-year metapopulation dynamics have increased over the years, possibly due to increasing frequency of exceptional weather conditions. We discuss the added value of large-scale and long-term population studies, but also emphasize the need to integrate more targeted experimental studies in the context of long-term observational studies. For instance, in the case of the Glanville fritillary project, the long-term study has produced an opportunity to sample individuals for experiments from local populations with a known demographic history. These studies have demonstrated striking differences in dispersal rate and other life-history traits of individuals from newly established local populations (the offspring of colonizers) versus individuals from old, established local populations. The long-term observational study has stimulated the development of metapopulation models and provided an opportunity to test model predictions. This combination of empirical studies and modeling has facilitated the study of key phenomena in spatial dynamics, such as extinction threshold and extinction debt.

AB  - The coastal landscapes of Estonia are young (less than 10,000 years old). Their development is affected by the Baltic Sea, by pre-existing geomorphology and by regional tectonic uplift. Since emerging from the sea 5,000 years ago, the coastal landscapes have been evolving under regressive sea conditions. The landscape diversity is greatest on coasts with variable topographies and those exposed to wind and waves. Low and flat parts of the coast, which are seasonally inundated, exhibit less variable landscapes. Landscape changes in coastal areas no longer affected directly by the sea have been caused largely by human activity. Abrupt socio-political and economic changes over the last century led to a cessation of traditional land use during the Soviet era with urban sprawl and expansion of recreation areas after re-independence in the beginning of the 1990s. The aim of this paper is to analyze the structure, formation conditions, and the velocity and extent of change in coastal landscapes (for both natural and human-induced impacts) along different coastal regions of Estonia. The Estonian coast can be divided into four distinct regions: 1) Gulf of Finland; 2) Baltic Proper; 3) Gulf of Livonia and 4) Coast of Vainameri, making it possible to compare the influence of sea exposure, geological structure, vegetation, soil productivity, age of human settlements and character of land use on the development of coastal landscapes. The results of the current study are applicable to coastal conservation, to the development of sustainable coastal land use and to the facilitation of transnational tourism.

AB  - Limited attention has been given to the underlying prerequisites for how the tourism industry can develop a well-informed, holistic and strategic governance that would lead to more robust sustainable tourism governance. By introducing a theoretical approach stressing a deeper and more contextual understanding of tourism development in the face of a growing interest in the sharing economy, the study engenders insights into the complexity of one public tourism organisation's creativity and ambivalence when approaching alternative tourism strategies. The aim is to undertake an in-depth investigation into the evolution of one tourism sharing economy concept initiated and implemented by a public tourism organisation in Sweden, focusing especially on the factors driving and hampering change from traditional tourism growth to a sharing business logic. Concluding remarks revolve around the complex environment in which the public tourism organisation manoeuvres. On the one hand, the study considers the lock-in of the vertical tourism-centric discourse and, on the other hand, the potential of breaking free from the traditional business model through co-creational capacity building in the regional context.

AB  - Mowing of semi-natural grasslands is an important management method to maintain the conservation value and species-richness of this habitat. Mowing using cutting instruments, e.g. sickle bar mowers, is thought to be superior by practitioners compared with other mechanical instruments that tears off the plant material, e.g. grass trimmers. However, almost no studies exist that supports this assumption. We analysed a 12-year field trial in a semi-natural grassland in south-eastern Sweden, with the aim of determining which mowing technique best maintains the conservation value of semi-natural grasslands. Two mowing techniques were compared: mowing using a hand-pushed sickle bar mower (a type of knife mower), or mowing using a grass trimmer at a 5-cm or 0-cm cutting height. The odds that a recorded species belongs to a group of indicator species were calculated for sample plots, and odds ratios were calculated contrasting treatments. Three types of indicator species classification systems were used: (i) indicators of management for species richness, (ii) indicators of excess nitrogen and (iii) indicators of lack of management. The odds ratios were calculated for years 1-5, 7 and 12 of the trial. In addition, Principal Response Curve analysis was performed to analyse the change in vegetation composition over time and ANOVA for plant species richness in plots. The results showed that over time there were no differences in the odds of finding indicators of any of the three types, for any of the mowing techniques. Furthermore, there were no apparent change in vegetation composition and only a small effect on richness. These results suggest that mowing using a sickle bar mower or a grass trimmer had the same effect on the floristic composition of grasslands, and both techniques can be recommended for use in semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Cruise tourism has a dubious reputation for conspicuous consumption and associated environmental harm. Cruises to the Arctic promise passengers pristine landscapes and authentic and engaging experiences interacting with local and Indigenous communities. Yet, these very environments and communities are under existential threat amidst the climate crisis, provoking the question of how to reconcile the ever-expanding Arctic cruise industry's conflict with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). To answer this question, the article proposes a novel approach that fuses concepts and methodologies from normative global governance research and critical tourism studies. Based on extensive empirical research in Norway, Canada and Iceland, the article presents stakeholder-sourced solutions that address a variety of justice conundrums associated with the expanding cruise tourism sector in the region. On the basis of the approach developed in the article, our research is able to inform public and policy discourse towards a just and sustainable transition of the polar cruise tourism industry in light of UN SDGs by highlighting the importance of creating 'syncretic encounters' based on four dimensions: authentic storytelling, decompressing spatial and temporal resources, just working conditions, and attention towards the built environment.

AB  - Anthropogenic eutrophication is one of the most common threats to inland water quality, often causing toxic algal blooms and loss of aquatic biodiversity. Mitigating the harmful impacts of eutrophication requires managing nutrient inputs from the catchment focusing on the major local drivers of eutrophication. These drivers can be identified using models that predict lake trophic state based on characteristics of the lake and its catchment. In this study, we aimed to extend the spatial scope of these models by identifying drivers of eutrophication in a large sample of lakes (1547) distributed across Finland. Moreover, we used satellite-observed chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration as trophic state indicator, instead of site-sampled data, which is commonly used in existing research. We identified major drivers of eutrophication on river basin district to country scale based on 11 catchment and lake characteristics, applying the random forest algorithm. On country scale, the catchment and lake characteristics explained 41% of the variation in lake chl a concentrations, and on river basin district scale, 20%-44%. Catchment and lake hydromorphology were the most important explanatory characteristics. Especially, high natural eutrophication level, shallow mean depth of lake, and small share of lake area in the catchment were related to increased lake chl a concentration. Moreover, depending on the dominant land use type in the model area, share of agricultural area and share of peatland area in the catchment were ranked among the most important drivers of increased lake chl a concentration. The results suggest that trophic state predictive models utilizing satellite-observed chl a concentration could provide an additional, cost-effective tool for addressing lake eutrophication, especially in areas without and extensive on-site monitoring network.

AB  - We conducted a two-dimensional production possibility frontier analysis to study the relationships between energy wood removal and 10 variables representing timber production possibilities and biological diversity. The analysis was restricted to the North Karelia region in Eastern Finland over a 40-year period. A large-scale forest planning system was used to define efficient future joint production possibilities between energy wood removal and the 10 variables. The results indicate that in North Karelia, a moderate amount of forest chips and firewood can be harvested without large impacts on the timber production potential or biological diversity. Large amounts of energy wood can be harvested from thinning stands, and this simultaneously supports timber production. Energy wood can be harvested from young stands with only minor effects on variables measuring biological diversity. However, if the economic outcome is maximized, about 50% of the energy wood removal at the target level of 1.5 million m(3) year(-1) will be from final cutting areas. The results of this analysis show that economically sound production of energy wood is strongly linked to the harvesting operations of other forest industries.

AB  - Forest planning in a participatory context often involves multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests. A promising approach for handling these complex situations is to integrate participatory planning and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The objective of this paper is to analyze strengths and weaknesses of such an integrated approach, focusing on how the use of MCDA has influenced the participatory process. The paper outlines a model for a participatory MCDA process with five steps: stakeholder analysis, structuring of the decision problem, generation of alternatives, elicitation of preferences, and ranking of alternatives. This model was applied in a case study of a planning process for the urban forest in Lycksele, Sweden. In interviews with stakeholders, criteria for four different social groups were identified. Stakeholders also identified specific areas important to them and explained what activities the areas were used for and the forest management they wished for there. Existing forest data were combined with information from interviews to create a map in which the urban forest was divided into zones of different management classes. Three alternative strategic forest plans were produced based on the zonal map. The stakeholders stated their preferences individually by the Analytic Hierarchy Process in inquiry forms and a ranking of alternatives and consistency ratios were determined for each stakeholder. Rankings of alternatives were aggregated; first, for each social group using the arithmetic mean, and then an overall aggregated ranking was calculated from the group rankings using the weighted arithmetic mean. The participatory MCDA process in Lycksele is assessed against five social goals: incorporating public values into decisions, improving the substantive quality of decisions, resolving conflict among competing interests, building trust in institutions, and educating and informing the public. The results and assessment of the case study support the integration of participatory planning and MCDA as a viable option for handling complex forest-management situations. Key issues related to the MCDA methodology that need to be explored further were identified: 1) the handling of place-specific criteria, 2) development of alternatives, 3) the aggregation of individual preferences into a common preference, and 4) application and evaluation of the integrated approach in real case studies.

AB  - Excessive phosphorus (P) inputs from agriculture are well established as a contributor to freshwater eutrophication. Decreasing these inputs is an important step in improving the ecological state of impaired waters. Particulate P (PP) is a significant contributor to diffuse P inputs in agricultural catchments. Identifying the main correlates for PP losses is an important step in reducing these inputs. However, there are few studies of long term temporal and spatial dynamics of PP in agricultural streams. Here, we investigate the relative importance of hydrology, catchment characteristics and geochemistry on PP concentrations and fluxes in agricultural headwaters. We evaluate long-term monitoring data from eleven small (<35 km(2)) Swedish catchments with at least seven years of measured flow and flow proportional water quality sampling. Using parametric and non-parametric regression together with principal components analysis (PCA), we identify in-stream and catchment variables relevant for predicting PP concentrations, e.g., suspended solids concentrations (SS), soil texture and average catchment soil P content, measured as ammonium lactate/acetic acid extractable P (P-AL). We show that PP is primarily correlated to SS concentrations, which in turn are correlated to average clay content and land use. However, the SS:PP relationships differ between catchments. No correlation between PP concentrations in the stream and soil P content was found. An increasing clay content decreases the slope of the relationship between SS and PP, i.e., in catchments with higher clay content, less PP is transported per unit SS. The PP/SS ratio increased significantly (p < 0.05) over time in four catchments, despite limited changes in SS or PP concentrations. Our study highlights the importance of long time series since the enrichment of P on SS in the streams is only detected when using long term monitoring data. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The lake Bjaresjosjon, Southern Scania, Southern Sweden, was studied in the context of the project 'The cultural landscape of the past 6000 years in Southern Sweden'.  Pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, physical and chemical analysis, magnetic measurements and radiometric methods (Pb-210, C-14) have been used to study palaeoecological changes, i.e. climate, land use, lake trophy and soil erosion during the past 3000 years.  This multidisciplinary study shows striking responses of diatom communities, physical and chemical characteristics, sediment yields and magnetic parameters to land-use changes and lake-level fluctuations.  Moreover, the latter are closely related to the settlement history at the site, inferred from archaeological records and historical sources.
   Before 650 AD, the limnological development was affected mainly by lake-level fluctuations, but partly also by human impact (extensive forest clearings and dominant pastoral farming).  With the expansion of arable farming (around 650 AD), human impact on the landscape was the major factor influencing soil erosion processes in the catchment and limnological changes in the lake.

AB  - Golf is said to be among the most rapidly increasing forms of land use, yet little is known of the effects of golf courses and golf playing on wildlife. A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather (Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P= 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.

AB  - This paper examines the first-best instruments for biodiversity maintenance in commercial boreal forests when landowners behave either in Faustmannian or Hartmanian way. Using an extended Hartman model, we show that biodiversity conservation requires both prolonged rotation age and leaving retention trees. While the former promotes some old growth species, the latter create new structural elements of decaying and dead wood, which can sustain a variety of saprolyxic species. A fully synchronized combination of retention tree subsidy and tax instrument is needed both to lengthen the privately optimal rotation period and to provide an incentive to leave retention trees. Using Finnish data we illustrate empirically the sizes of instruments. When combined with a harvest tax, the retention tree subsidy is 1000 and 750 epsilon in the Faustmann and in the Hartman model, respectively. When used with a timber subsidy or a site value tax, the retention tree subsidy is 1700 epsilon/ha in both models. The harvest tax rate varies over the range 40-65% in the Faustmann model and 20-40% in the Hartman model, while timber subsidy is between 0.5-1.0% and site value tax is about 1.75%.

AB  - We censused breeding birds for three years in natural landscape mosaics of virgin old-growth spruce forest and mire in a large protected forest area in northern Sweden. Twenty forest patches, ranging from 0.2 to 17.8 ha in size, were selected in two matrix types, dominated by forest and mire, respectively. Patches were very similar with regards to habitat features. There was a strong effect of patch area on species richness, but no effect of matrix type. Standardization of species richness by rarefaction revealed that small patches (< 5 ha) had fewer and large patches (> 10 ha) more species than expected. Overall distribution of species across patches showed a highly significant nested pattern, indicating that a few habitat generalists occupy all size classes, whereas more demanding species avoid small patches regardless of landscape composition. Individual species tended to be distributed evenly across patch classes and no significant edge effect in terms of density of birds was found. Our results have bearings on actions to preserve avian diversity in northern boreal forests: small patches (< 5 ha) provide habitat only for habitat generalists, and therefore larger (> 10 ha) patches should be preserved.

AB  - Background and rationale: The underlying assumption was that the aesthetics of the hospital surroundings are often neglected.
   Aims: This article is the first part of a larger study into the aesthetics of general hospitals. The aim of the study is to throw light on the influence of aesthetics on the health and well-being of patients and the professional personnel, and to examine how aesthetic considerations are dealt with. We present a survey of how the aesthetic dimension is planned and it is considered important in the strategic plans of Norwegian general hospitals.
   Methods: Data were sampled by analyzing the strategic plans of somatic hospitals. Sixty-four of 86 hospitals responded (74%). Concepts were categorized in a matrix of 11 main categories, each with subcategories. The method was quantitative, in that the analyzed material was amenable to counting.
   Results: Very few concrete guidelines or directions for the aesthetic dimension have been included in written documents. This indicates that the aesthetic area is a neglected field in the directions for the daily management of hospitals.
   Conclusions: The research available today on the contribution of environmental aesthetics to health, rehabilitation, and well-being suggests that it is important to have concrete guidelines recorded in strategic plans. This field concerns the maintenance of high quality in the caring professions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate the possible relationships between erosion intensity and changes in climate and land use during the past 5.5 cal. k years at Lake Lehmilampi, eastern Finland. In this study we compare a detailed geochemical sediment record with (1) forest and land use history inferred from the first pollen and charcoal records from Lake Lehmilampi, and (2) existing archaeological surveys and independent proxy-records of climate change in the study region. The physical and geochemical sediment parameters examined include grain size analysis data and 23 chemical elements, determined with four selective extractions and ICP-MS. There are indications of possible human impact in the lake catchment as early as the Neolithic period, c. 3000-2550 bc, but the first undisputable signs are dated to 1800-100 bc. Cereal pollen reappears at c. ad 1700 and increases rapidly until c. ad 1950. The Holocene Thermal Maximum, its end c. 2000 bc, and the Medieval Climate Anomaly' were major climate events that had a prominent effect on erosion intensity, while human impact was a more significant factor during the period 3000 bc-ad 800 and from ad 1500 onwards. Although signs of changes in erosion intensity found in the sediment were small in this small catchment, they were significant enough to have a clear impact on the fraction of potentially mobile element species. This fraction increases with decreasing erosion intensity, which is probably related to a higher degree of chemical weathering and leaching during periods of decreased erosion.

AB  - A high-resolution multi-proxy record from sediments of a small-sized lake situated in Telemark, southeastern Norway, was used to reconstruct the local landscape development of the past c. 10,500 years. Our data demonstrate that changes in vegetation composition and structure in the first two-thirds of the Holocene are principally attributable to climatic changes and high erosion rates, as deduced from geochemical and physical (loss-on-ignition) proxy analyses. The highest signals of erosional inputs to the lake (c. 8030-5760 cal. BP) can be correlated with the first part of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Nevertheless, evidence from pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and microscopic charcoal analyses indicates the presence of nutrient-rich and disturbed environments already during the middle Mesolithic (c. 10,050-9400 cal. BP). It also shows traces of animal husbandry (c. 5580 cal. BP) and small-scale cereal cultivation (c. 5520 cal. BP) in the early Neolithic. In subsequent periods, human impact remains at a relatively low level and does not generate significant palaeo-environmental changes. Not until the second half of the Bronze Age (c. 2840 cal. BP) is some intensification in animal husbandry recorded, whereas crop cultivation continues to play a minor role in the second millennium BP. The establishment of a full farming economy took place during the Roman Iron Age (c. 1790 cal. BP), characterised by extensive forest clearance and local fires, crop cultivation in permanent fields and the presence of open pastures. This establishment is associated with advanced soil degeneration and increased erosion rates.

AB  - The objective of the work of the Activity was to develop and assess new cultural techniques in short rotation forestry(SRF), and to investigate factors affecting yield optimisation. Nine countries participated in the work (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, UK, USA and CEC). The high level of interest in the work of the activity is a reflection of the increasing importance of short rotation forestry, particularly coppice, in many of the participating countries where it is being used to produce heat or electricity.
   The main elements of the work involved. Collection of information on SRF cultural treatments Collection of data on yield, spacing and rotation length Collection of data on costs of production and economic analysis of short rotation coppice production systems Revision of the production systems handbook Development of a coppice decision support system which articulates with a computerised information system for SRF production. Liaison has been maintained with the other Task VIII activities concerned with short rotation forestry and the Mechanisation Activity of Task IX.
   Data has been collected from many of the participating countries on the relationship between clone/site/spacing/cutting cycles. Similarly, data has been collected on the economics of SRF production systems. This information has beet? analysed and the results presented.
   The Production Systems Handbook has been updated with information provided by the participating countries. Significant advances have been made in Sweden where most of the short rotation forestry for energy is grown, around 11,000 hectares currently.
   A computerised version of the Production Systems Handbook has been produced. This information system has been developed using spreadsheets and utilises Visual Basic to run the program and provide a User interface with the underlying information and data on yield and economics.

AB  - REDD+ activities in Tanzania have been financially supported mainly by Norway. Approximately 40% of the funds have been allocated to pilot projects in nine districts, which were implemented not by government, but by NGOs. This decision by the Norwegian Embassy was taken partly in the interest of speedy implementation, but also because of recent problems of government corruption. This paper-based on case studies from Kilosa, Kilwa and Kondoa-assesses the implications of allocating local government only a minimal role. The focus is on the building of REDD+ governance structures; more specifically their input legitimacy (participation, transparency and accountability) and output legitimacy (effectiveness, efficiency and equity). The conclusion is that the NGOs generally implemented the pilot projects as contracted, but that local government has lost the opportunity to gain experience and develop the competence needed to implement REDD+ in the future and ensure its longer-term sustainability.

AB  - Aim: To discover whether lake and stream diatom communities show different patterns in species richness and in their local (LCBD) and species (SCBD) contributions to beta diversity in relation to macroscale environmental characteristics.
   Location: Finland.
   Methods: As biological data, we used diatom samples collected from Finnish stream (n = 492) and lake (n = 290) sites. As explanatory variable data, we used information on macroscale environmental and historical aspects, such as bedrock, soil and post-glacial highest shoreline. We also accounted for catchment areas, different levels of isolation and relative centrality of the study sites. We ran multiple linear models and selected best models based on AICc values.
   Results: We found that macroscale factors affecting diatom richness and ecological uniqueness differed clearly between streams and lakes. LCBD and species richness of stream communities were more affected by regional environmental characteristics, whereas LCBD and species richness of lake communities were more often driven by spatial measures. The measures of LCBD and species richness showed a slightly negative relationship in streams, but no such relationship was detected in lakes. Also, we showed that, for both streams and lakes, SCBD was strongly determined by the number of sites occupied by a species and the overall abundance of a species.
   Main conclusions: Our findings related to the distinction between the determinants of lake and stream species richness or LCBD may be tied to the different hydrological connectivity levels occurring in freshwater lotic and lentic systems. Also, in streams, sites with exceptional ecological uniqueness seem to have a rather low number of species. Our findings may be applied to biological conservation and monitoring planning, emphasizing that not only species-rich but also unique low-richness sites may be valuable conservation goals.

AB  - Organic farming is often advocated as an approach to mitigate biodiversity loss on agricultural land. The phyllosphere provides a habitat for diverse fungal communities that are important for plant health and productivity. However, it is still unknown how organic farming affects the diversity of phyllosphere fungi in major crops. We sampled wheat leaves from 22 organically and conventionally cultivated fields in Sweden, paired based on their geographical location and wheat cultivar. Fungal communities were described using amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR. Species richness was higher on wheat leaves from organically managed fields, with a mean of 54 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared with 40 OTUs for conventionally managed fields. The main components of the fungal community were similar throughout the 350-km-long sampling area, and seven OTUs were present in all fields: Zymoseptoria, Dioszegia fristingensis, Cladosporium, Dioszegia hungarica, Cryptococcus, Ascochyta and Dioszegia. Fungal abundance was highly variable between fields, 10(3)-10(5) internal transcribed spacer copies per ng wheat DNA, but did not differ between cropping systems. Further analyses showed that weed biomass was the strongest explanatory variable for fungal community composition and OTU richness. These findings help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of organic farming on the diversity of organism groups in different habitats within the agroecosystem.

AB  - Food and culinary routes have been embraced by many destinations [Hjalager, A.- M., & Corigliano, M. A. (2000). Food for tourists - determinants of an image. International Journal of Tourism Research, 2, 281-293]. However, these routes often include narrow geographical areas. The purpose of this study was to identify the challenges and possibilities of networking and collaboration in a food tourism project in a larger geographic area, specifically the Taste of National Tourist Routes in Norway. Although contacts among business operators and participants have been established, different priorities and dissatisfaction among participants suggest that building relationships and sharing knowledge as part of networking and collaboration are difficult. A lack of willingness, involvement and trust are critical factors that affect the success of a well-intentioned network-based food tourism project. Additionally, internal conflicts between government ministries and agencies may also impede the success of a project of this scale. Nevertheless, the outcomes are not solely negative, as the establishment of initial contacts may eventually lead to formal collaborative opportunities and food tourism developments in the future.

AB  - Deep uncertainties in planning and policy-making related to climate mitigation pathways actualises the need for transport planning practices that embrace exploration and assessments of alternative future development directions. While conventional, forecast-based assessment practices are acknowledged to be of limited relevance in assessing potential trend-breaking developments, those practices have become strongly institutionalised and proven difficult to challenge. Applying a discourse perspective, this paper contributes with a practice-oriented analysis of how knowledge perspectives and established assessment practices influenced the consideration of alternative development directions and policy measures in the Swedish 12-year National Investment Plan for road and rail infrastructure 2018-2029. More specifically, the analysis regards how alternative futures and measures aimed at supporting a more 'transport efficient society' were addressed and assessed. The analysis illuminates a strong influence of established practices over the definition of what is considered relevant knowledge, in constructing an understanding of transport infrastructure investments as insignificant to climate mitigation, and in legitimizing the marginalization of alternative development directions. In effect, the study shows how established practices may result in significant democratic consequences, when public and political discussion over transport futures and climate mitigation pathways is constrained by a narrow span of possible futures presented.

AB  - Land use affects the global climate through greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, as well as through changes in biophysical properties of the surface. Anthropogenic land use change over time has caused substantial climate forcing related to albedo, i.e. the share of solar radiation reflected back off the ground. There is growing concern that albedo change may offset climate benefits provided by afforestation, bioenergy or other emission reduction measures that affect land cover. Conversely, land could be managed actively to increase albedo as a strategy to combat global warming.
   Albedo change can be directly linked to radiative forcing, which allows its climate impact to be compared with that of greenhouse gases in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the most common LCA methods are static and linear and thus fail to account for the spatial and temporal dependence of albedo change and its strength as a climate forcer. This study sought to develop analytical methods that better estimate radiative forcing from albedo change by accounting for spatial and temporal variations in albedo, solar irradiance and transmission through the atmosphere. Simplifications concerning the temporal resolution and aggregation procedures of input data were evaluated.
   The results highlight the importance of spatial and temporal variations in determining the climate impact of albedo change in LCA. Irradiance and atmospheric transmittance depend on season, latitude and climate zone, and they co-vary with instantaneous albedo. Ignoring these dependencies led to case-specific errors in radiative forcing. Extreme errors doubled the climate cooling of albedo change or resulted in warming rather than cooling in two Swedish cases considered. Further research is needed to understand how different land use strategies affect the climate due to albedo, and how this compares to the effect of greenhouse gases. Given that albedo change and greenhouse gases act on different time scales, LCAs can provide better information in relation to climate targets if the timing of flows is considered in life cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment.

AB  - Traffic predictions for large road and rail projects are often inaccurate. International borders create political, cultural and economic barriers which reduce the demand for international transport, partly offset by some opportunities which increase transport demand. An expert opinion approach is used to help identify and evaluate the effect of these barriers on transport demand. The research explores why initial traffic levels predicted for the Oresund fixed link between Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmo in Sweden were not achieved. It uses the Danish Great Belt fixed link as a control case in assessing the scale of these barriers to interaction. Subsequent trans-Oresund traffic growth is attributed mainly to a tax agreement between the Danish and Swedish governments to assist cross-border commuters, to discounted tolls and to complementary labour and housing market opportunities.

AB  - We analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of cultural vibrancy in the Swedish sub-region of Skaraborg. Our database consists of 4170 geo-localized cultural activities and facilities, mapped between October 2013 and March 2014. We make use of the TWC methodology for the dynamic simulation of the evolution of geo-localized activity starting from an observed distribution of events, and of the AutoCM ANN architecture to understand how cultural variables are related to the rest of the Skaraborg socio-economy. We find that cultural vibrancy in Skaraborg is likely characterized by a 'flaring' pattern of initial, widespread activity followed by a re-concentration into the main local urban hubs. The deep reason behind this unsuccessful developmental trajectory is the lack of centrality of cultural production in the local socio-economy, and of integration across cultural production sectors. This is in turn due also to structural bottlenecks of a non-cultural nature such as insufficient access of women to higher education. We make a case for the necessity to develop a new precision cultural policy design approach founded upon the science of complexity for both policy design and assessment, and we provide and illustrate a first technical toolkit to this purpose.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) is an economically valuable target species in the North Sea. Although individual Nephrops populations are scattered, the crustacean is managed regionally by the European Union (EU). The spatial competition for fisheries in the North Sea is growing especially due to expanding offshore wind farms (OWF) and newly implemented marine protected areas (MPA). Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. PresentOWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears.

AB  - New information is often emphasized as a basis of effective and scientifically sound environmental policy and management. However, outdated or incorrect information is not automatically nor instantly replaced by new insights. This article focuses on the various ways environmental information can be unintentionally left with insufficient attention or purposefully neglected. Energy-related emissions caused by road traffic in Finland are used as an illustrative example and light pollution caused by artificial lighting is identified as an emerging issue that has gained especially low recognition in the environmental agenda. Four different reasons for this lack of recognition are discussed: recognized unawareness, false awareness. deliberate unawareness and concealed awareness. Paying attention to light pollution is important because of various ecological, socio-cultural and economic effects but also because implementing measures aimed for reducing light pollution create possibilities for alleviating other social and environmental problems in transport and land use policies.

AB  - In 1827, an Indian juggler named Mooty Madua Samme converted to Christianity in Stockholm, Sweden. This historical event got much attention in the press at the time - as did his succeeding marriage to a Swedish woman named Erica - and was celebrated as a victory for the Evangelical Lutheran faith. Later, in the 1840s, a narrative depicting the event spread via a travelogue by Xavier Marmier, which was translated and mediated through the Swedish press, and reacted to by Samme's priest; in the 1850s, Samme's name surfaced again - now in context of the contemporary freedom of religion debates in Sweden. In this article, we explore Samme's baptism (and interrelatedly, his marriage) by looking at newspaper mediations of the event and the related narratives. Seen from a microhistorical perspective, we show how Samme's conversion and religious otherness was utilised in contemporary religious and political discussions, and we argue that the event and narratives surrounding the baptism can augment our understanding of the Swedish nineteenth century religio-cultural landscape in which he was situated.

AB  - The long-term planning of sustainable forest treatment at the landscape level is an increasingly more complex task. Local treatment schedules, pertaining to homogeneous sub-areas called stands, must be developed over a time horizon of a few centuries. Thousands of local schedules must be coordinated to satisfy hard constraints, and balance soft constraints and optimization criteria. Constraints and objectives are defined in terms of economical, recreational, and environmental effect.
   The aim of the forest treatment schedule is twofold. Over the near time horizon, it must provide clear instructions for forest treatment. In addition, sustainability over the full horizon must be demonstrated. In this context, sustainability means balancing growth and yield in the long term, the preservation of bio-diversity, and catering for human recreational and cultural value. Conventional OR based approaches have failed to give satisfactory results for this type of problem. We describe a method built on explicit constraint descriptions and a memory-based local search procedure for solving rich models of the long-term forest treatment scheduling problem. We also describe a configurable decision support system, called Ecoplan, where the scheduling kernel is based on our method.
   The system relies heavily on close interaction with a stand simulator, which must provide forestry knowledge necessary to guide the scheduling process, including the definition of abstract forest treatment actions. Ecoplan also provides facilities for user interaction in the planning process, functionality for locking specific parts of a plan, and flexibility to alter key factors in the plan such as active constraints and objective criteria. Tn this way, the system supports the definition and exploration of "what-if" scenarios.
   The Ecoplan system has been built on the initiative of the major Norwegian forest owners, addressing a problem area that is becoming increasingly more complex to handle and more critical to society.

AB  - Understanding the anthropogenic and natural factors that affect runoff water quality is essential for proper planning of water protection and forest management, particularly in the changing climate. We measured water quality and runoff from 10 unmanaged and 20 managed forested headwater catchments (7-12,149 ha) located in Finland. We used linear mixed effect models to test whether the differences in total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) export and concentrations observed can be explained by catchment characteristics, land use, forest management, soil fertility, tree volume and hydrometeorological variables. Results show that much of variation in TOC, TN and TP concentrations and export was explained by drainage, temperature sum, peatland percentage and the proportion of arable area in the catchment. These models explained 45-63% of variation in concentrations and exports. Mean annual TOC export in unmanaged catchments was 56.4 +/- 9.6 kg ha(-1) a(-1), while in managed it was 79.3 +/- 3.3 kg ha(-1) a(-1). Same values for TN export were 1.43 +/- 0.2 kg ha(-1) a(-1) and 2.31 +/- 0.2 kg ha(-1) a(-1), while TP export was 0.053 +/- 0.009 kg ha(-1) a(-1) and 0.095 +/- 0.008 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for unmanaged and managed, respectively. Corresponding values for concentrations were: TOC 17.7 +/- 2.1 mg L-1 and 28.7 +/- 1.6 mg L-1, for TN 420 +/- 45 mu g L-1 and 825 +/- 51 mu g L-1 and TP 15.3 +/- 2.3 mu g L-1 and 35.6 +/- 3.3 mu g L-1. Overall concentrations and exports were significantly higher in managed than in unmanaged catchments. Long term temperature sum had an increasing effect on all concentrations and exports, indicating that climate warming may set new challenges to controlling nutrient loads from catchment areas.

AB  - Contemporary processes of environmental policymaking in general span over several territorial tiers. This also holds for the EU Water Framework Directive system of environmental quality standards (EQS), which are part of a complex multi-level institutional landscape, embracing both EU, national and sub national level. Recent evaluations show that many EU member states, including Sweden, have not reached the ecological goals for water in 2015. Departing from theories on policy coherence and multi-level governance, this paper therefore analyses Swedish water governance as a case to further our understanding of policy implementation in complex governance structures: how does policy coherence (or the lack thereof) affect policy implementation in complex governance structures? To answer this question, the paper maps out the formal structure of the water governance system, focusing on power directions within the system, analyses policy coherence in Swedish water governance through mapping out policy conflicts between the EQS for water and other goals/regulations and explore how they are handled by national and sub-national water bureaucrats. The study concludes that without clear central guidance, 'good ecological status' for Swedish water will be difffcult to achieve since incoherent policies makes policy implementation inefficient due to constant power struggles between different authorities, and since environmental goals are often overridden by economic and other societal goals. Further research is needed in order to explore if similar policy conflicts between water quality and other objectives occur in other EU member states and how bureaucrats handle such conflicts in different institutional settings. This study of the Swedish case indicates that the role of the state as a navigator and rudder-holder is important in order to improve policy implementation in complex governance structures otherwise; bureaucrats risk being lost in an incoherent archipelago of ecological, social and economic goals.

AB  - During the fall of 2018, a two-day seminar in Lulea, Sweden, gathered an interdisciplinary group of researchers to reflect on the socio-urban and political processes of resource extraction and urbanization in the global periphery. Cases from the Arctic region and South America were discussed from the point of view of law, history and technology, planning, and urban economics to explore the multiple conflicts arising from resource-based development in sparsely populated areas. From this perspective, we present here the cases of Kiruna, Sweden, and Calama, Chile, to highlight the need to expand urban and landscape research into the nexus between resources and urbanization.

AB  - Forestry with short stand generations and simplified forest structures has markedly affected forest biodiversity. One group of organisms adversely affected by clear-cutting is ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as they are associated with the roots of living trees. Retention forestry is a way of reducing logging impacts and enhancing biodiversity conservation. Increasing the proportion of trees retained at harvest may improve ECM fungal diversity. We investigated the potential for lifeboating of ECM fungi through the harvesting phase in an experimental field study in a 190-year-old Scots pine forest in northern Sweden. The experiment comprised four levels of tree retention-unlogged forest, plots with 60% or 30% of evenly distributed trees retained and clear-cuts without retained trees. We sampled soils and determined identities, frequencies and relative abundances of ECM fungal species during 3 years following logging through the use of high-throughput sequencing of amplified ITS2 markers. We identified 149 ECM fungal species, with the five most abundant species accounting for 50% of the total ECM fungal amplicons. Three years after harvesting, the proportion of ECM sequences in the total amplicon pool had decreased proportionally to the extent of tree removal. In clear-cuts, ECM fungal relative abundance had decreased by 95%, while ECM fungal species richness had declined by 75%, compared to unlogged plots. Tree retention enabled the maintenance of the most frequent ECM species, while more lowly abundant species were progressively lost at random with increasing level of tree removal. Five of the most frequent ECM fungal species remained present after clear-cutting, probably associated with pine seedlings. Synthesis and applications. Tree retention can moderate short-term and potentially also long-term logging impacts on ECM fungi. Local ECM fungal diversity is preserved in proportion to the amount of retained trees. Abundant species may be largely maintained, even by low levels of tree retention and on naturally established seedlings. However, conservation of more infrequent species requires higher levels of tree retention, and our results suggest that around 75% of the ECM species are lost with the forest certification standard of 5% retention trees left at logging.

AB  - Management of forest resources and related industries has a significant effect on the Finnish environment. Therefore there was an obvious need for a study to assess environmental impacts and to identify needs and options for environmental improvements in the forest sector. It was against this background that the Finnish Environment Institute carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the Finnish forest industry. This application included methodological innovations compared with the traditional product-related LCA because it was a study of the whole production system of the mechanical and chemical forest industry. Areas for improvement of environmental protection in the forest sector for the year 2005 were identified on the basis of the inventory (emissions, wastes, etc.), environmental impact assessment and other available data. During the study a new impact assessment procedure was developed in order to assess more actual impacts of country-specific systems. Although the prioritized factors found were not strongly ranked against each other it can be concluded that maintaining biodiversity in the context of forestry practices and increasing the efficiency of energy use are the key issues in the environmental protection of the forest sector. Before detailed ranking of emissions and other stressors can be produced there is a need for more reliable stressor data, better understanding of stressor-effect relationships and more consensus on the importance of different environmental problems. Despite the limitations and needs for further development, the presented LCA approach can be regarded as a useful tool for providing a deeper understanding of the key issues in the environmental protection of a whole production system.

AB  - Natural resource (NR) exploitation often gives rise to conflict. While most actors intend to manage collectively used places and their NRs sustainably, they may disagree about what this entails. This article accordingly explores the origin of NR conflicts by analysing them in terms of competing pathways to sustainability. By comparing conflicts over mine establishments in three places in northern Sweden, we specifically explore the role of place-based perceptions and experiences.
   The results indicate that the investigated conflicts go far beyond the question of metals and mines. The differences between pathways supporting mine establishment and those opposing it refer to fundamental ideas about human nature relationships and sustainable development (SD). The study suggests that place-related parameters affect local interpretations of SD and mobilisation in ways that explain why resistance and conflict exist in some places but not others. A broader understanding of a particular conflict and its specific place-based trajectory may help uncover complex underlying reasons. However, our comparative analysis also demonstrates that mining conflicts in different places share certain characteristics. Consequently, a site-specific focus ought to be combined with attempts to compare, or map, conflicts at a larger scale to improve our understanding of when and how conflicts evolve. By addressing the underlying causes and origins of contestation, this study generates knowledge needed to address NR management conflicts effectively and legitimately. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper provides insights into the handling of climate change issues related to cultural heritage at different government decision levels dealing with physical planning, and in particular roads. Data are derived from a qualitative analysis of official reports and interviews with local and regional planners in three Swedish regions with contrasting climates. The theoretical lens of Institutional Interplay is applied to an analysis grouped into six themes: Climate threats to cultural heritage, Adaptation measures, Preparedness, Institutional preconditions, Institutional interplay, and Challenges. The results suggest that despite a strong environmental reputation internationally, Sweden is not particularly well prepared for dealing with future climate change impacts on cultural heritage and landscape. The lack of national standards and standardised methods risks regional and sectoral variation in the treatment of similar tasks, a problem which deficiencies in knowledge and continuing education are perpetuating. The degree to which discussions and cooperation occur between divisions within the same authority, between authorities, and in national networks varies considerably. Routines and criteria for prioritisation of cultural heritage mitigation, essential under conditions of limited resources, have yet to have been implemented. We conclude with five recommendations for improving the planning process with respect to climate change risks to cultural heritage.

AB  - Urban freight by motorized transport poses a threat to the sustainable development of modern city centers through extensive emissions of greenhouse gasses, contributing to congestion, and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. In addition, further densification of European city centers demands an effective use of urban areas. As urban planners are shifting their focus from automobiles to cyclists and pedestrians, the cargo bike has been used as an alternative to motorized vehicles for urban freight in several European cities. Flexible use of cargo bikes permits efficient delivery of goods in congested urban areas, with zero emissions. Cargo bikes are also becoming a part of the city logistics in northern countries like Norway, where they are prone to adverse weather conditions, low temperatures and roads covered with snow and ice. The Armadillo, a four-wheeled cargo bike from the Swedish company Velove, was used in Norway for its first winter in 2018/19. Based on the lack of research on how cargo bikes operate in northern climates and a hypothesis that cargo bikes operate with less efficiency on winter roads than in summer conditions, the two following research questions were formulated: 1. What challenges and obstacles are cargo bikes facing on winter roads? 2. How can we facilitate and ensure efficient operation of cargo bikes in northern climates? To answer these questions, two methodological approaches were applied. First, observations and GPS-tracking of a working cargo cyclist were performed on winter roads in Trondheim, Norway. Second, seven qualitative interviews were conducted among experienced cargo cyclists in several Norwegian cities. Calculated velocities for the observed cargo cyclist showed that the average velocity in general was 27.6% lower for winter trips than spring trips. The observations and the interviews show that even though snow, ice, slush and low temperatures reduces the cargo bikes efficiency, using cargo bikes for urban delivery on winter roads is fully feasible. The design of the Armadillo, sufficient clothing and good planning solves many of the challenges faced by cargo bikes on winter roads. In addition, a cargo bike with more durable parts, larger wheels and better illumination, as well as an increase in the amount of bicycle lanes, would further facilitate the efficient operation of cargo bikes in northern climates. The biggest challenge concerning the use of cargo bikes for urban delivery in northern countries, seems to be urban consolidation centers or micro depots as an essential prerequisite for effective operation. Such centers would also provide the cargo cyclists a warm place to take breaks and to load, charge and maintain the cargo bikes. The findings in this study are supposed to provide further knowledge for urban planners, municipalities, road owners and logistic companies on how to ensure efficient operation of cargo bikes on winter roads.

AB  - Contact with natural environments enriches the human microbiome, promotes immune balance and protects against allergies and inflammatory disorders. In Finland, the allergy & asthma epidemic became slowly visible in mid 1960s. After the World War II, Karelia was split into Finnish and Soviet Union (now Russia) territories. This led to more marked environmental and lifestyle changes in the Finnish compared with Russian Karelia. The Karelia Allergy Study 2002-2022 showed that allergic conditions were much more common on the Finnish side. The Russians had richer gene-microbe network and interaction than the Finns, which associated with better balanced immune regulatory circuits and lower allergy prevalence. In the Finnish adolescents, a biodiverse natural environment around the homes associated with lower occurrence of allergies. Overall, the plausible explanation of the allergy disparity was the prominent change in environment and lifestyle in the Finnish Karelia from 1940s to 1980s. The nationwide Finnish Allergy Programme 2008-2018 implemented the biodiversity hypothesis into practice by endorsing immune tolerance, nature contacts, and allergy health with favorable results. A regional health and environment programme, Nature Step to Health 2022-2032, has been initiated in the City of Lahti, EU Green Capital 2021. The programme integrates prevention of chronic diseases (asthma, diabetes, obesity, depression), nature loss, and climate crisis in the spirit of Planetary Health. Allergic diseases exemplify inappropriate immunological responses to natural environment. Successful management of the epidemics of allergy and other non-communicable diseases may pave the way to improve human and environmental health.

AB  - With their potential to effectively address multiple urban sustainability challenges, the emerging policy discourse on nature-based solutions seeks to encourage the development of multifunctional nature for sustainable and just cities. Nature-based solutions, however, are vulnerable to co-option by powerful interests in ways that limit their contribution to a broad range of sustainability goals. Reflexive governance arrangements between different types of actors, engaging in continuous and iterative processes of learning and readjustment of institutions and practices, provide a way to address this issue. However, the potential of reflexive governance in increasing commitment to sustainable and just cities, and the role of power struggles in such processes, remains underexplored. To study this question, we undertake a comparative case study analysis of nature-based solutions in Utrecht (The Netherlands), Malmo (Sweden), and Utsunomiya (Japan). These are analyzed using a framework structured around the dimensions of system analysis, goal formulation, and strategy implementation, to which we apply a justice lens. The findings demonstrate reflexive processes in each of the studied cases, but the justice dimension is not always explicitly taken into account or clearly influenced in positive ways. We unveil tensions between the ideal of sustainable and just cities and the reality of urban nature-based solution initiatives being partially dependent on the power structures they seek to influence for their continued existence. We argue against dismissing the studied cases as neoliberal projects on these grounds. Reflexive governance for sustainable and just cities entails a continuous struggle for dominance between different ideas and interests. Moreover, the battlegrounds for these struggles may look very different across sociopolitical contexts. Provided that justice considerations are continually present, reflexive governance of urban nature-based solutions is likely to contribute to more sustainable and just cities.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) attract a growing interest in research and practice due to their potential to address climate change while improving human health and well-being and safeguarding biodiversity. The integration of the NBS concept in urban governance, however, is still emerging and it faces regulatory, political, financial and cognitive barriers. While the literature acknowledges an increase in NBS experimentation in cities and documents new governance approaches for NBS, academic knowledge on transformative learning to advance the potential of NBS is scarce. This article unpacks enabling and constraining factors for transformative learning through interpretative case study analysis of two NBS projects in Malmo, Sweden: BiodiverCity and EcoCity Augustenborg. To map instances of learning and investigate conditions for transformative learning in NBS implementation, this article draws on the concepts of experimenting, governing and learning and uses an analytical framework resting on three pillars: visionary ideas and strategies; stakeholder participation; and institutional arrangements. The article identifies seeds of transformative learning and argues that cross-boundary collaboration, action-oriented knowledge production, reflexive governance and citizen involvement are key enablers for transformative learning, which requires supporting structures, evaluation, continuity and relational capacities to thrive. To advance the implementation of NBS and increase urban sustainability, transformative learning should be acknowledged as a key strategic component of change. This, however, requires transformative learning to be more seriously considered in research and practice related to nature-based urban transformations.

AB  - Few environmental issues have resulted in such a heated policy-science controversy in Sweden as the 1990s acidification debate in the north of the country. The belief that exceptionally high stream acidity levels during hydrological events was caused by anthropogenic deposition resulted in a governmentally funded, multi-million dollar surface-water liming program. This program was heavily criticized by a large part of the scientific community arguing that the acidity of northern streams was primarily caused by naturally occurring organic acids. Here, we revisit the acid deposition legacy in northern Sweden two decades after the culmination of the controversy by examining the long-term water chemistry trends in the Svartberget/Krycklan research catchment that became a nexus for the Swedish debate. In this reference stream, trends in acidic episodes do show a modest recovery that matches declines in acid deposition to pre-industrial levels, although stream acidity continues to be overwhelmingly driven by organic acidity. Yet there are legacies of acid deposition related to calcium losses from soils, which are more pronounced than anticipated. Finally, assessment of these trends are becoming increasingly complicated by new changes and threats to water resources that must be recognized to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially counterproductive measures to adapt and mitigate human influences. Here we make the argument that while the acidification era is ending, climate change, land-use transitions, and long-range transport of other contaminants warrant close monitoring in the decades to come.

AB  - Species richness is habitat-dependent but may also be affected both by the surrounding landscape and by spatial variation within habitats. Different taxa may then be affected by different external conditions. To establish the extent and variation in such influences, vascular plant and breeding bird species composition was examined in 28 remnant sites of traditionally managed oak-hazel woods in south-central Sweden and the effects of area, internal structure (amount of managed or abandoned small grasslands), surrounding landscape and distances to other sites were determined. Plant species numbers varied with internal structure while bird species numbers were primarily determined by site area. Adjoining habitats did not affect either plant or bird species numbers. Species composition of both plants and birds varied with regional situation. The different effects for plants and birds were explained by great differences in mobility and turnover during a short time period. Appraisal of total biodiversity cannot rely on examinations of single taxa such as birds because biodiversity depends on interactions between biota and ecosystem structures, and their history. Both external and internal structures have to be considered in the conservation of both traditionally managed and pristine sites wi:hin managed landscapes.

AB  - Forestry and mining constitutes an important part of Swedish basic industry. These industries are heavily male-dominated and are expressing an ambition to become more gender equal and less gender-segregated, arguing that this could strengthen their competitiveness in a number of areas. In this article we explore how company representatives construct gender equality as a business case and discuss how these constructions restrict and/or enable gender equality in these organizations. Departing from a social constructivist understanding of how language (re)produces gendered power relations in the workplace, the empirical basis of this paper consists of eight interviews with respondents who possess special insights into, and being of strategic importance to, gender equality issues in forestry and mining companies. In our analysis we found three dominant dimensions of the business case of gender equality Marketing (as) gender equality, Uncovering the male norm and Gender equality as a depoliticized value. We conclude that the business case framing facilitates for the companies to engage in issues of gender equality. However, issues concerning conflicting interests and power relations seem to be difficult to address within the business case discourse. This we argue affects and shapes the terms for gender equality in these organizations.

AB  - Large and old trees have a vital role in preserving biodiversity in forest ecosystems. We used National Forest Inventory data from 1921 to 2013 for studying changes in densities (stems per ha) of large trees (diameter >= 40 cm) in Finland. In addition, densities of old trees (age >= 150 years) are reported from 1971 to 2013. We present results separately for the three subzones of the boreal biogeographical zone. Large trees have increased as much as 325%. The change has occurred mainly since the 1970s. On country level, old trees have become slightly less common (- 4%) since the 1970s, although a decrease was actually observed only in the northern boreal subzone. The large majority of old trees in Finland are quite small in diameter, however. Trees that are both large and old show a notable increase from 1971 to 2013. During the 2010s, densities of large trees were higher in the southern boreal subzone than in the northern boreal subzone, but in the 1920s the opposite was true. Densities of old trees have been much higher in the northern boreal subzone. The observed densities of large trees are still considerably smaller than those observed in unmanaged old-growth forests in Scandinavia. High densities of large and/ or old trees were observed in areas with restrictions on wood production emphasizing their role in maintaining biodiversity. The results reflect the destructive effects of former land use and the transition from dimensional cuttings to clear cuts and thinning from below after the 1940s. Proportionally larger changes were observed for southern Finland, where a higher human population density and the resulting more intensive land use had more severe detrimental effects on forests. As the densities of large trees and old trees have developed in a completely different manner in Finland, our results suggest that monitoring only the size distribution of trees will not sufficiently describe the role of old trees as constituents of biodiversity. Thereagainst, densities of large trees and large old trees developed in a similar manner.

AB  - Background: To assess population persistence of species living in heterogeneous landscapes, the effects of habitat on reproduction and survival have to be investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a matrix population model to estimate habitat-specific population growth rates for a population of northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe breeding in farmland consisting of a mosaic of distinct habitat ( land use) types. Based on extensive long-term data on reproduction and survival, habitats characterised by tall field layers (spring- and autumn-sown crop fields, ungrazed grasslands) displayed negative stochastic population growth rates ( log lambda(s): -0.332, -0.429, -0.168, respectively), that were markedly lower than growth rates of habitats characterised by permanently short field layers (pastures grazed by cattle or horses, and farmyards, log lambda(s): -0.056, +0.081, -0.059). Although habitats differed with respect to reproductive performance, differences in habitat-specific population growth were largely due to differences in adult and first-year survival rates, as shown by a life table response experiment (LTRE).
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that estimation of survival rates is important for realistic assessments of habitat quality. Results also indicate that grazed grasslands and farmyards may act as source habitats, whereas crop fields and ungrazed grasslands with tall field layers may act as sink habitats. We suggest that the strong decline of northern wheatears in Swedish farmland may be linked to the corresponding observed loss of high quality breeding habitat, i.e. grazed semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Transboundary air pollution from industries in Nikel and Zapolyarnij has caused severe damage to the environment in Southern-Varanger in Norway and in Pechenga municipality in Russia. The work presented in this paper focuses on the integration of in-situ air pollution data with remote sensing based land cover maps. Land cover maps have been utilised to detect changes in the major land cover types within the area. The major change in the environment was the decrease of the sensitive liche-dominated land cover types, and the increase of bilberry-dominated land cover types and finally the increase of the land cover types with the greatest air pollution stress (industrial barren, barren, and partly damaged vegetation, defoliated forests, lichen removal). A GIS based method for assessing the relationship of the remotely sensed land cover maps with the environmental condition parameters was developed and applied. By comparing the results from this analysis we observed that the land cover types with the greatest stress had the largest concentrations of SO2 in the ground air layer, while the land cover types with minor damage (the remaining lichen-dominated vegetation) had rather low concentrations of sulphur dioxide in the ground air layer. The area of the land cover types with the greatest stress (industrial barren, barren and partly damaged vegetation) has increased in the period 1973-1988, and the degradation is carried out in a such manner that sensitive mountain and lichen vegetation formations have been transformed into a more barren-like environment. The increase in the emissions has also transferred the natural barrens which also consisted of some sparse vegetation into a complete barren with little vegetation left. Also the epilitic lichens and mosses on bare rocks and stones were also removed by the high concentrations of SO2. The land cover types with minor damage (with the remaining lichen-dominated vegetation) had rather low concentrations of the contaminants (SO2, Ni and S), while the partly damaged and damaged land cover types had the highest concentrations of the contaminants. An exception was the Ni and S concentrations found in class 11 Industrial barrens which were lower than expected. Associations between the degradation and the SO2 concentration in the air were also documented. The conclusion from this analysis is that the in-situ data support the observations of damaged vegetation and industrial barrens imaged by the Landsat satellites, especially in the surroundings of Nikel and Zapolyarnij.

AB  - Strategic planning which focuses on rural tourism is based fundamentally on the adjusting to changes in the operational environment. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is a commonly used tool for analysing both the internal and external environments in order to attain a systematic approach and support for a decision situation. In this study, we show how some weaknesses of SWOT analysis can be avoided and how it can be elaborated upon in order to provide more comprehensive decision support. The approach is applied to the question of does local culture have the potential to be a success factor in rural tourism in two case areas, namely in the regions of Yla-Savo in Finland and Kassel in Germany. The research was based on expert interviews, which were structured according to the principles of value-focused thinking and A'WOT analysis. A'WOT is a hybrid method combining the well-known SWOT analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In this study, SMART techniques are applied in an A'WOT framework instead of the AHP. The objectives and the operating environment, i.e. the two major elements in any strategic management, were covered in the analysis. The results showed that local culture has the potential to be a success factor in rural tourism, in other forms of rural entrepreneurship, and also in the case study regions. Investments which enhance and strengthen local culture are recommended over those that utilise culture and traditions to make products in tourism business. Strengthening local culture opens up possibilities for future innovations and sustainable development. A strong culture and an awareness of one's own traditions form a natural foundation for innovations. Value-focused thinking used as a methodology to define the values and objectives along with A'WOT for strategic planning, provide good means of enhancing sustainable innovations.

AB  - The negative effects of elevated concentrations of inorganic aluminium on aquatic organisms are well documented. Acid deposition is often cited as a main driver behind the mobilisation and speciation of aluminium in soils and surface waters. In the study, we tested the hypothesis that sulphur deposition is the main driver for elevated concentrations of inorganic aluminium in 114 base poor, boreal Swedish streams. However, the deposition of anthropogenic sulphate has decreased substantially since it peaked in the 1970s, and at the current deposition levels, we hypothesise that local site parameters play an important role in determining vulnerability to elevated concentrations of inorganic aluminium in boreal stream waters. Presented here are the results of a principal components analysis of stream water chemistry, acid deposition data and local site variables, including forest composition and stem volume. It is shown that the concentrations of both organic and inorganic aluminium are not explained by either historical or current acid deposition, but are instead explained by a combination of local site characteristics. Sites with elevated concentrations of inorganic aluminium were characterised by small catchments (< 500 ha) dominated by mature stands of Norway spruce with high stem volume. Using data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory the area of productive forest land in Sweden with a higher vulnerability for elevated inorganic aluminium concentrations in forests streams is approximately 1.5 million hectares or 7% of the total productive forest area; this is higher in the south of Sweden (10%) and lower in the north (2%). A better understanding of the effects of natural processes and forest management in controlling aquatic inorganic aluminium concentrations is therefore important in future discussions about measures against surface water acidification.

AB  - In this study, an attempt to classify the flow regime alterations for 18 Norwegian rivers has been carried out. A recent report from the Norwegian authorities stated that around 50 regulated watercourses have high priority in the revision of their regulation permit before 2022 [1]. The report classifies rivers by scoring the impact of hydropower regulation on fish, biodiversity, and recreation. Then the report suggests changes in their revision according to their environmental and hydropower importance. In some cases, mitigation measures like implementation or revision of minimum flows are suggested. This paper provides a detailed study of the hydrological alterations produced by hydropower regulations on a national scale. The results will be compared with the classification carried out by Sorensen et al. [1] in terms of fish status as a result of hydropower impacts. The comparison will provide the hydrological indices that are most impacted, facilitating the selection of mitigation measures included in the regulation permit revision.

AB  - This paper focuses on understanding the place for regenerative building standards within the context of politically green Nordic social welfare states. To this end, it examines the particular case of adopting the Living Building Challenge (LBC), an iconic example of regenerative design standard, in Sweden. An extensive document analysis comparing the Swedish building and planning regulations as well as the Miljobyggnad national certification system with the LBC, shows overlaps and barriers the standard can face when adopted in the country. Barriers are validated and further discussed in interviews with one of the few architects trying to achieve a certified LBC building in Sweden and Swedish public authorities from the Boverket (Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning). Results from the document analysis and interviews show barriers to implement the LBC in Sweden are a product of a conscious political and ideological decision from the welfare state which considers infrastructure, and all its potential sustainable versions, a public good to be provided to all and funded by all. This premise contrasts with the self-sufficient approach promoted by the LBC, which in this particular aspect, can be interpreted as a threat to the welfare state.

AB  - Twenty-eight diadromous fish species occurred in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East in historical times. Their current distributions were assessed in terms of abundance classes (missing, rare, common and abundant) in 196 basins ranging from Morocco to northern Norway and from Greenland to Iran.
   Their current distributions were modelled using abiotic, biotic, climatic and anthropogenic (regional anthropogenic pressures) variables. Anthropogenic variables were derived from characteristics of large dams (height, distance from the outlet, percentage of main stem river available downstream of dam) and human population density. These data were taken from the EEA Eldred 2.08 (European Lakes, Dams and Reservoirs Database) that deals comprehensively with large European dams and includes all obstacles of this type. To deal with ordinal response variables, we applied proportional odds models.
   Twenty-two species-specific models were successfully built according to the reduction of deviance and the validation process, of which eight included one or more anthropogenic variables. No model could be established for six endemic or highly endangered species such as Acipenser sturio and Coregonus oxyrinchus.
   Most response curves were easily interpretable since they were related to specific aspects of species' ecology. Anthropogenic variables related to large dams impacted negatively on the distribution of diadromous fishes through the perturbation of river discharge patterns, the loss of river connectivity and the accessibility to essential habitats, particularly for Salmonid species that spawn in headwater streams. However, one species which can complete its life cycle using only the most downstream part of the basin, Liza ramada, was found to be favoured by the changes in hydrological regime. The bell-shaped curves obtained from human population density for three diadromous species were connected on one side to a common settlement history of human and animal populations and on the other side to negative impacts of human activities arising at high population density.
   Our approach can provide the basis for identifying special areas of conservation prior to planning restoration programmes at country or basin scales, as well as for more specialized studies focusing on one species only or at the local scale.

AB  - In order to facilitate the transition to electricity industries with low CO2 emissions, it is important to understand which firms invest in renewable energy technologies. This study concentrates on the heterogeneous characteristics of investors in wind power that are embedded in the investors' dynamic capabilities. Data on 617 investors in the Swedish onshore wind industry are analyzed. Investors with higher investment and management experience and a mixed generation portfolio whose business is electricity production have more assets in wind. Investors' age in the wind industry has a negative relation with assets in wind, illustrating that latecomers are investing more. Individual incumbents of the electricity industry hold a relatively large amount of assets in the Swedish wind industry, but the group of incumbents as a whole possesses only 15 percent of wind assets. The results suggest that tailor-made policies could stimulate a greater variety of firms to invest in wind power. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The strongly increasing demand for biofuel from forests poses new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Methods that may combine biofuel production with conservation goals need to be tested for various forest types. One possible conservation-oriented management alternative is partial cutting of closed canopy oak-rich forests (may also be called conservation thinning). Such cutting may counteract succession and restore a semi-open canopy structure, which may favor epiphytes. We evaluated this possibility by surveying the epiphyte community of lichens and bryophytes on large oaks in 24 oak-rich temperate forests in southern Sweden. Treatment plots, and reference plots with no cutting, were surveyed before, and 6 years after cutting. In the treatment plots, about 25% of the basal area was harvested, and mainly small and intermediate sized successional trees were removed. We detected significant positive effects of partial cutting on species density for both lichens and bryophytes. The additional variation in light influx at tree level (after the cutting) could not explain the change in species density. The increase in density of lichen species was highest on oaks with small trunk diameter and on oaks with deep bark crevices. The pooled frequency of species of conservation concern increased after the cutting, but the change in species composition was weak; colonization events occurred over mean minimum distances of 63.5 m to the nearest potential source tree (n = 22 events and 9 species). Overall, we found significantly higher colonization rates, and significantly lower extinction rates per tree for lichens in the treatment plots. We conclude that partial cutting influenced epiphytes of large oaks positively, as was the case for several other organism groups at the same study sites (previous studies). A mild form of biofuel harvesting may represent sustainable resource-use in these forests, compatible with conservation. However, part of the forest should be kept untouched for species vulnerable to changes in microclimatic conditions, and for evaluation of long-term effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is no established theoretical basis for the legitimacy research in the forest sector. This study develops a valid and comprehensive conceptual framework for empirical studies on legitimacy. The theoretical analysis is verified by detailed empirical illustrations from the public discourse on the Finnish forest regime. The theoretical framework analyzes the objects of support, patterns of legitimacy, performance evaluations, and how these relate to one another. The objects of political support can be classified as political community, regime norms, regime institutions, and actors. The patterns of legitimacy can be analyzed at different levels: (A) democracy and other forms of government, (B) different forms of participation, and (C) normative principles. The principles can be further classified into (1) core regime, (2) input, (3) throughput, and (4) output principles. Moreover, all these patterns of legitimacy can be usefully arranged in (1) democratic, (2) extra-democratic, and (3) counter-democratic classes.

AB  - Green structure has undergone many changes during the process of urban development. This paper compares Stockholm, Sweden, and Xi'an, China, in order to illustrate these changes over time and how they reflect the deeper human-nature relationship. This type of analysis can uncover the cultural identity of different cities and clarify urban forms that are common to other geographical locations. We found well-preserved green structure of different periods in the two cities, indicating similar structural development traditions but using different components. Analysis and comparison of three stages of formation revealed that conflicts between the built environment and green structure are an illustration of human-nature interactions, which change with cultural and societal changes in different areas. We argue that rethinking green structure and invoking deep respect for nature is a starting point for resolving such conflicts and the wider environmental crisis.

AB  - Gender equality in natural resource management is a matter of sustainability and democracy for Sweden's government, however the country's forest remains a highly gender-segregated sector. We examine how gender inequality is problematized within Swedish forest and rural policy documents using the What's the problem represented to be? (WPR) approach. We build on previous efforts to investigate gender inequality in the forest sector by expanding the critical analysis to rural development policy. We conduct interviews with forest experts, owners, and practitioners to shed light on where there are gaps within the policy representations and uncover alternative policy options that are presented. Our findings corroborate that gender inequality is represented to be a technical problem, with policy measures aiming to increase the number of women within a forest sector that continues to maintain rigid conceptions about forestry production values. While there are claims of success in the increase of women within the sector in aggregate, there is little change in the numbers of women in decision -making positions. Forest policy relies upon women to bring growth and sustainability to the forest industry, while rural policy expects women to halt rural population decline. Our findings suggest that merely trying to fit more women into a mold that has been shaped for and by inflexible forestry and masculine values is an impediment not only to gender equality but also to the inclusion of other social groups and ideas in the changing rural landscapes of Sweden.

AB  - Abstract
   In the study outlined, visitor-employed photography (VEP) has been used to investigate how tourists and locals evaluate the built rural landscape in five Norwegian winter destinations in the summer time. Norwegian and international tourists and some locals were equipped with single-use cameras, a log and a questionnaire with the instruction to take pictures of attractive and non-attractive elements in the constructed landscape. Despite the intention of the study to emphasize the built landscape, the selection of motives shows that tourists - especially the international ones - are more strongly occupied with the natural landscape and its attractive elements than, for instance, the outlook of buildings. The respondents value destination development where the natural, cultural and built landscape form a unity which reflect the perceived images of traditional rural environments and everyday life. On the other hand, Norwegians - and locals particularly - are more conscious about local building traditions, especially the non-attractive elements in that respect. Our findings demonstrate that VEP and public participation are useful tools in destination development and branding, and that a holistic design and approach might create competitive advantages for rural destinations trying to position themselves in the overall market place.

AB  - The resilience of the boreal forest field layer (herbs plus dwarf shrubs) to anthropogenic disturbances is insufficiently understood because of the multitude of direct or indirect driver pathways and environmental conditions involved. We hypothesized that the impact of the forest-management-induced disturbances on field layer varies along the gradient of site productivity. To explore that we proposed a method for estimating the proportional effect of each driver on the field-layer composition, in a survey data of 273 mature or overgrown boreal forests, by combining variogram analysis with multifactorial general linear modelling. In forest types of very low and high productivity, field-layer composition was sensitive to the management disturbances in general and, particularly, to the management-controlled variations in the structure of the stand and its understory, i.e., in environmentally stressful conditions the main limiting factors were light availability and its spatiotemporal variability. At intermediate productivity, instead, the natural heterogeneity of ground layer conditions was the dominant driver, pointing to the limitation of regeneration microsites. Accordingly, on soils with low and high productivity, biodiversity-oriented sustainable forestry should diversify silvicultural approaches among stands and (or) enhance the within-stand mosaic, whereas small-scale natural disturbances of the ground-level "organic blanket" should be promoted in forests of intermediate productivity.

AB  - It is often suggested to release oaks (Quercus robur) from competition, to ensure their survival and boost their conservational value. However, few studies have explored how long-lasting this effect is and how it affects saproxylic beetles.Ten years after cutting, we investigated effects of different release cutting levels (high, medium, and no release) around 140-year-old retained oaks in a commercial forest with Norway spruce (Picea abies).We evaluated oak vitality using crown and dead wood measurements. Saproxylic beetles were caught in window traps, identified to species level, and grouped according to their association with oak and/or Norway spruce.Released oaks had more light, higher temperatures, greater crown growth, and less dead wood in the crown compared to the no-release control.After 10 years we still found a higher abundance of oak-associated beetles and higher overall species richness of saproxylic beetles in the released oaks. Beetle species composition significantly differed between released oaks and control.We suggest avoiding planting trees beneath retained oaks when regenerating conifer forests and to proceed with conservation management during subsequent thinning by removing regeneration under the oak crowns. We emphasize the benefits of monitoring the retained oaks to maintain tree vitality, habitat quality, and insolation.

AB  - Whilst the benefits of agroforestry are widely recognised in tropical latitudes few studies have assessed how agroforestry is perceived in temperate latitudes. This study evaluates how stakeholders and key actors including farmers, landowners, agricultural advisors, researchers and environmentalists perceive the implementation and expansion of agroforestry in Europe. Meetings were held with 30 stakeholder groups covering different agroforestry systems in 2014 in eleven EU countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). In total 344 valid responses were received to a questionnaire where stakeholders were asked to rank the positive and negative aspects of implementing agroforestry in their region. Improved biodiversity and wildlife habitats, animal health and welfare, and landscape aesthetics were seen as the main positive aspects of agroforestry. By contrast, increased labour, complexity of work, management costs and administrative burden were seen as the most important negative aspects. Overall, improving the environmental value of agriculture was seen as the main benefit of agroforestry, whilst management and socio-economic issues were seen as the greatest barriers. The great variability in the opportunities and barriers of the systems suggests enhanced adoption of agroforestry across Europe will be most likely to occur with specific initiatives for each type of system.

AB  - This paper explores the motivations behind urban climate governance in eight Swedish municipalities. The study demonstrates that political consensus among, and willingness of, urban political leaders is of importance for motivating climate actions. Municipalities are moreover motivated by the accomplishments of other cities, national and subnational policies, and an increasing climate concern in society. In line with previous research, individual policy entrepreneurs have been important for local climate action; however, with the adoption of national and subnational policies, local climate policies are becoming increasingly institutionalised. Although some of the conclusions of the study confirm the significance of a polycentric governance approach, little relevance was attributed to citizen participation. The institutionalisation of urban climate governance deserves further attention so as to better understand how the dynamics of polycentric governance can be affected, and what implications this may have on climate policy-making process, and the engagement and support of urban residents.

AB  - Preservation of small habitat patches termed as "woodland key habitats" or "especially important habitats" in the Finnish Forest Act has become an integral part of biodiversity-oriented forest management. Forest Act habitats belong to particular habitat types defined in the act, and they are supposed to have natural-like stand characteristics. However, very little is known about the actual stand structure in the designated habitats. Our aim was to compare stand characteristics between brook-side key habitats and comparable managed forests as controls. Seven study areas were selected from four regions across southern Finland. Within each study area ten key habitats and ten controls (140 stands) were randomly selected. Living and dead trees and Cut Stumps were measured in each stand within a 0.2 ha plot. The average degree of previous cutting was significantly lower whereas the volume of dead wood, volume of deciduous trees, and stand diversity were each significantly higher in key habitats than controls. The average volume of dead wood was 11.7 m(3) ha-(1) in key habitats and 6.5 m(3) ha(-1) in controls. However, there was considerable variation among individual stands, and a large part of key habitats could not be distinguished from randomly selected control stands with respect to stand characteristics. The preservation of natural brook channels with their immediate surroundings is undoubtedly important for maintaining aquatic and semiaquatic biodiversity, Nevertheless, when complementing the forest conservation network in file future, main emphasis in selecting potentially valuable stands should be placed on important structural features such as dead wood and old trees.

AB  - Riding a bicycle is increasingly encouraged as a sustainable transport solution, especially in urban areas. However, safety concerns, both perceived and actual, can significantly lower the willingness to ride among the population. To support cycling planning and policy in the double task of increasing the levels of cycling while mitigating crash risk, there is a need to better understand the behaviours and attitudes of bicycle riders. In this manuscript, we study a cohort of Finnish bicycle riders through four questionnaires, the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ), Cyclist Risk Perception and Regulation Scale (RPRS), Cyclist Anger Scale (CAS), and Cyclist Aggression Expression Inventory (CAX). Our findings show low self-reported errors and violations, and high levels of knowledge regarding traffic rules among Finnish bicycle riders. Most participants report low levels of aggression, which is generally dealt with in constructive ways, while anger was most commonly a result of interactions with motor vehicles and less with other road users such as pedestrians. To further reduce the crash risk in cycling, our results point to the need for further separation between bicycle riders and motorised vehicles, and for the development of risk perception and positive behaviours among riders, particularly those engaging in risky behaviours.

AB  - Cultural heritage has developed into an important tool in marketing and destination development projects. Cultural heritage, as well as multiplicity, is also a political concept that has become important in the academic and public debate. The aim of our study is to analyse cultural heritage as a tourism and marketing product in relation to multiplicity. The discussion focuses around how the story of cultural heritage is constructed, whom it is for and what is incorporated and what is not. These questions are discussed using a marketing project in southern Sweden aimed at developing attractive activities related to the story of the Snapphanes (a resistance group active in the Swedish-Danish war in the 17th century) as a case study. The conclusion highlights how local identity-making is not always easily combined with place marketing processes. The article claims that it is important to leave space for the bottom-up to keep a more diversified storytelling.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are important ecosystem engineers, providing habitat for a range of marine organisms which sustain many ecosystem functions. Due to global loss of seagrass, conservation and restoration incentives are rapidly increasing. However, it is not well understood how environmental setting affects the structural and functional diversity of macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina), and to what extent their importance as macrofaunal habitat is affected by abiotic variables across spatial scales. In the present study, we explored macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows and adjacent bare habitats across contrasting envi-ronments in Southern Sweden. We assessed taxonomic and functional diversity in concert and evaluated envi-ronmental properties as explanatory variables for the observed differences. Our results showed that eelgrass meadows supported a significantly higher taxonomic richness and abundance compared to adjacent bare sedi-ments whereas differences in structural and functional diversity was mainly a function of site and highly influenced by dominance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans. Interestingly, functional redundancy was higher in brackish compared to marine sites, illustrating the effect of generalist species that cover a wide range of func-tional traits. Abiotic sediment variables did not explain the variation in structural or functional diversity, but were largely overshadowed by the effect of eelgrass and its belowground biomass. From a restoration perspec-tive, our results imply that the positive effects of eelgrass restoration are similar across environments and that the presence of eelgrass is the most important factor in structuring benthic communities, but the effects on functional diversity and redundancy need further attention.

AB  - Currently, huge investments are being made in the electricity infrastructure in Europe. However, one third of the European grid investments are delayed, even though the majority of the population in Europe is in favour of a greener energy mix. This paradoxical situation is connected to the fact that although interdependent, the production and transportation sides of renewable energy sources are treated as two distinct processes. The two types of infrastructure undergo separate processes for development consent and are the target of opposition from various citizen groups. In this article we compare the British, Norwegian, and Swedish grid development regimes in order to analyse their opportunities and challenges. The comparison demonstrates that the regimes differ on significant aspects, e.g. different historical trajectories, technological setups, arguments, and main drivers. The article highlights the importance of achieving sustainable energy systems by relying on a sensible strategy for grid development, and the importance of moving beyond the focus on a sustainable, "green-fuelled" grid.

AB  - Gotha Canal is perhaps the most gigantic construction work ever undertaken in Sweden. It is a seaway through Sweden that connects the Baltic Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. It is nowadays considered to be one of the most famous cultural landmarks in Sweden from the time it opened for traffic the canal was in 1832 until 1978 the canal was privately owned. Since then, it has been owned by the state. Such a long time of private ownership of transportation link is remarkable. This paper analyses why the change from private to state ownership finally took place and also looks at the implication of this ownership change for profit maximising behaviour and maintenance of the canal. A discussion of how ownership of a cultural landmark like Gotha Canal can be structured is also provided. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The general purpose of this study is to describe and explain attitudes and intention to consume a new fish product by using the general framework from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) in a multi-group context. The field experiments were performed in Norway with 110 adolescents and young adults and 149 of their parents, and in Spain with 175 adolescents and young adults (termed "young consumers"). The product is a fish burger produced by a Norwegian firm for the Norwegian market, and was tested in-home in both countries. All constructs are analysed by multi-group analysis in LISREL for reliability, validity and invariance across groups. Results from this study indicate that the constructs within the TPB are valid and similar across cultures and generations. The parents showed a significantly higher motivation to consume and more positive attitude toward the fish burger compared with their kids. The Spanish consumers expressed a significantly more negative attitude towards the product compared with the two Norwegian groups. Perceived behavioural control is more important than attitudes and norms in explaining intention to consume the fish burger across cultures (Spain and Norway) and across generations (parents and their kids). This indicates that the TPB can be used not only in explaining intention to consume common food products, but also in the area of testing new products. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate policies may have adverse geographically unequal socio-economic impacts that, if left unaddressed, may hamper their implementation. This paper examines factors explaining rural-urban perceptions of the effects of climate policy on agriculture and rural areas. The paper adds to current knowledge by jointly analysing socio-economic factors and factors describing the distinct role geographical locations play in shaping these percep-tions. We conduct a novel statistical analysis utilising a large preference survey of the Norwegian adult popu-lation spatially matched at the municipality level with indexes capturing centrality and the relative importance, and, hence, vulnerability of agriculture to effects of climate change. Our analysis does not identify a principal conflict between the goals of climate policy, rural policy, and agricultural policy across geographical locations. Conflicts along the rural-urban gradient arise around the priority given to the three policy areas, and the concrete impact of climate mitigation measures on rural areas. Centrality more than agricultural properties explains the formation of resistance to policies. The policy process should therefore acknowledge rural concerns, and climate mitigation options should be more carefully designed to avoid further rural-urban polarisation.

AB  - Source separation systems for the management of domestic wastewater and food waste has been suggested as more sustainable sanitation systems for urban areas. The present study used an attributional life cycle assessment to investigate the carbon footprint and potential for nutrient recovery of two sanitation systems for a hypothetical urban area in Southern Sweden. The systems represented a typical Swedish conventional system and a possible source separation system with increased nutrient recovery. The assessment included the management chain from household collection, transport, treatment and final return of nutrients to agriculture or disposal of the residuals. The results for carbon footprint and nutrient recovery (phosphorus and nitrogen) concluded that the source separation system could increase nutrient recovery (0.30-0.38 kg P capita(-1) year(-1) and 3.10-3.28 kg N capita(-1) year(-1) while decreasing the carbon footprint (-24 to -58 kg CO2-eq. capita(-1) year(-1)), compared to the conventional system. The nutrient recovery was increased by the use of struvite precipitation and ammonium stripping at the wastewater treatment plant. The carbon footprint decreased, mainly due to the increased biogas production, increased replacement of mineral fertilizer in agriculture and less emissions of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment. In conclusion, the study showed that source separation systems could potentially be used to increase nutrient recovery from urban areas, while decreasing the climate impact. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the importance of palynological site selection criteria, specifically basin size, for the detection of vegetation mosaics and small- or local-scale human activity within a spatially diverse, mosaic landscape. Using a site selection strategy which recognizes landscape patchiness, pollen analyses from three small peat basins (10-56 m diameter) in an open, exposed upland valley (>250 m OD) provide records which are sensitive to local vegetation mosaics and small-scale, localized agriculture. The results indicate c. 4000 C-14 years (4400 cal. years) of land use, with spatial and temporal variations in the valley. Contrasts between the sequences suggest that local pollen production remains an important component of the pollen rain deposited in small peat basins, even in open environments; this is especially true of palynological 'agricultural indicators'. By comparison, sites with regional pollen source areas underestimate the spatial diversity of the upland landscape, and are insensitive to small-scale human activity in an environment where the fragmentary distribution of soils suitable for agriculture favoured a small-scale, dispersed pattern of farming. It is therefore essential to match the spatial resolution of pollen records with the grain size or scale of variations in the environment under investigation in order to sense the scale of mosaics in vegetation and agriculture within patchy landscapes.

AB  - Red deer Cervus elaphus is a highly appreciated and intensively managed game species throughout Europe. A common management objective is a sustainable harvest of large trophies. In southern Sweden, management has mainly aimed at preserving the nominate subspecies C. elaphus elaphus. Seasonal migration of red deer males may, however, complicate both harvest management as well as conservation efforts. I used individually identified male red deer in southern Sweden to observe distance travelled from rutting areas to areas used by males in summer and winter. Adult males were identified by antler shape and photo-documented during rut. Photos from the rut were compared to trophies of deer harvested or found dead, to found cast antlers and to stags photographed during summer. From 1969 to 2007, a distance between rutting ground and summer/winter quarters was established for 96 identified stags. An average distance of 14 km and a maximum distance of 47 km were recorded between rut and summer/winter observations. The seasonal migration of males increases the risk of overexploitation of males with harvest in both rutting areas and wintering areas. Harvest management and conservation efforts may fail if males seasonally migrate outside the management unit. The results suggest that seasonal migration must be considered in harvest management and conservation and that there is a need for a regulation of male harvest. Furthermore, the study stresses that the success in deer management of single hunting units, may be largely dependent on the harvest policies in the near surroundings as well as in areas tenths of kilometres away, suggesting that a successful management must rely on co-operation and co-ordination on a landscape scale.

AB  - The negative impact of anthropogenic disturbance and land-use changes on large mammals is generally recognized within conservation biology. In southeastern Norway, both moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) occur throughout human-modified landscapes, facilitating an interesting comparative study of their habitat use. By using pellet group counts, we looked at the importance of forest structure, vegetation characteristics and human disturbance (e. g., distance to the nearest house, nearest paved road, and nearest edge between field and forest) in shaping the winter distribution of both species at multiple spatial scales, in non-agricultural habitats. Moose occurred more often in areas with higher densities of heather and Vaccinium sp. in the ground layer, and used areas with more open forest structure. The proportion of built-up areas, within a 1,000-m buffer, negatively influenced moose occurrence. Roe deer occurred more often in areas with deciduous trees and patches with juniper and Vaccinium sp. in the ground layer, used areas near roads less, but were significantly associated with areas near the field-forest ecotone. The proportion of built-up areas positively influenced roe deer distribution within a 2,500-m buffer. Roe deer seem to be able to persist in more human-dominated landscapes, possibly due to the availability of field-forest edges providing both high-quality fodder and cover in close proximity. Moose, on the contrary, did not show any preference for areas associated with human disturbance, and their distribution was only associated with patches providing food.

AB  - 1. River regulation affects riparian systems world-wide and conservation and restoration efforts are essential to retain biodiversity, and the functioning and services of riverine ecosystems. Effects of regulation on plant species richness have been widely addressed, but the filtering effect of regulation on guilds has received less attention.
   2. We used a functional trait approach to identify adaptive plant strategies through regulation-tolerant traits and predict shifts of riparian vegetation communities in response to regulation. We analysed variation in functional diversity across gradients of hydrological alteration in northern Sweden in relation to modified timing and infrequent major floods, along with frequent short-term inundation.
   3. Functional richness was similar in all study sites, but species richness declined with increasing intensity of regulation, and the species lost were largely functionally redundant (i.e. co-existing species that have similar contribution to an ecosystem function). Guilds of species intolerant to waterlogging were particularly unsuccessful in most regulated sites as they were affected by hydropower dams which replace major fluvial disturbances with frequent short inundation events. We predict that this guild will disappear, with likely consequences for the entire riverine ecosystem.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that functional traits tolerant to waterlogging or submergence and lack of major fluvial disturbances were key to understanding our results. We suggest that the functional trait approach can be integrated with knowledge of other ecosystem components to provide an understanding of ecosystem function that can be used to guide fluvial ecosystem management.

AB  - 1. In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments.
   2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch.
   3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.
   4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest.
   5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the impact of two forms of short-term knowledge communication-lectures and group deliberations-on public managers' policy beliefs regarding genetic biodiversity in the Baltic Sea. Genetic biodiversity is a key component of biological variation, but despite scientific knowledge and far-reaching political goals, genetic biodiversity remains neglected in marine management. Previous research highlights lack of knowledge among managers as one explanation to the implementation deficit. This multidisciplinary study builds on the identified need for an improved knowledge transfer between science and ongoing management. A basic knowledge package on genetic biodiversity in the Baltic Sea was presented as either a lecture or a deliberative group discussion to two separate samples of public managers who are involved in Baltic Sea and other biodiversity management at the regional level in Sweden. The empirical findings show that the communicated information has an impact on the public managers' beliefs on genetic biodiversity of the Baltic Sea. Lectures seem more efficient to transfer knowledge on this theme. Those who received information through a lecture strengthen their confidence in area protection as a management tool to conserve genetic diversity. They were also more convinced of the obligation of authorities at national and regional level to take on larger responsibility for genetic conservation than those managers who participated in a deliberative discussion.

AB  - A population of Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in south-central Sweden showed a strong preference for forest older than 35 years and with more than 25% Norway spruce (Picea abies). This preferred habitat constituted 24% of the study area. The proportion of avoided habitats was 30%, and the remaining 46% could be described as used but not preferred habitats. Given these proportions, the squirrels can be shown theoretically to be able to reach all preferred patches by moving across the used, although not preferred habitat patches, or within the preferred ones. Males had larger home ranges (mean 121.6 ha) than females (mean 23.0 ha). Mean daily movement was 430 m for males and 180 m for females; the maximum movement was 2800 m for males and 680 m for females. Most of the preferred habitat occurred in fragments larger than the area requirement of an individual squirrel, and even the most isolated fragments were within a trivial range for squirrels. Therefore, we predict that the random sample hypothesis will give a good prediction of the effects of forest fragmentation on the red squirrel in this landscape. However, if the proportion of avoided habitats increases, isolation and fragment size might affect the population density of red squirrels and the population size would be smaller than predicted from the random sample hypothesis.

AB  - Green tree retention is often applied in forests otherwise harvested by clearcutting. Its aim is to support biodiversity by contributing to a continuity of living trees and large-diameter dead wood in the new generation of a forest. However, high levels of mortality can undermine the aims of tree retention and pose a concern for forest managers. Therefore, knowledge about the mortality of retention trees over the long term is needed. We calculated cumulative tree mortality for the seven most common tree species up to 20 years after clearcutting based on a chronosequence of dead and living trees in 583 tree groups on 206 clearcuts distributed over a wide area in boreal central Sweden. For all tree taxa combined and for the three most common tree taxa (Scots pine, Norway spruce and two birch species) we modeled tree mortality based on structural and environmental variables measured for each tree group and characteristics of the clearcut using generalized linear mixed effects models. The cumulative mortality averaged over all clearcut ages was 12% for Scots pine, 25% for Norway spruce and 16% for birch. Only 10% of all retention tree groups had a mortality >50%. Key factors reducing mortality for all tree taxa combined were tree density, tree volume of a retention group and the position at a former stand edge abutting open habitat, while a high wind exposure increased tree mortality. For the three most common species (pine, spruce, birch), the same factors as for all taxa combined were of importance, except tree density that resulted in species specific responses. For pine and spruce, the presence of seed trees on the clearcut reduced mortality. Increased mortality was additionally observed on wet soils. Mortality increased with tree height in birch and with diameter and slenderness ratio in spruce. Generally, a focus on retaining trees in groups with large tree volumes and tree density in less wind exposed positions and on forest edges will decrease the mortality after clearcutting and thus also reduce dead wood input.

AB  - Urban freight transport is an important issue in sustainable mobility discussions. It constitutes a significant proportion of urban traffic, and expected negative impacts for urban freight transport can be arguments against implementing restrictive measures targeting passenger traffic. The scarcity of empirical studies might lead to over- or underestimation of consequences for urban freight transport. This might slow shifts towards more sustainable mobility or cause unintended negative consequences. A long-planned 14-month capacity reduction in a main road tunnel in Oslo, Norway, causing significantly increased congestion, offered an excellent opportunity to study urban freight transport adaptations, effects and consequences. With truck drivers and logistics professionals as key informants, the study amplifies voices not often heard in research. Truck drivers adapted by avoiding the tunnel during rush hours only to a limited degree, and less than general traffic did. They reported limited flexibility, as routes and trip timing are strongly defined by customer contracts. The wider consequences for drivers were more stress and less predictable workdays. The findings might improve understandings of how truck drivers can and do adapt, and what consequences they experience. This will help authorities and freight companies plan for changes in urban transport systems aimed at sustainable mobility.

AB  - Although protected forests are usually kept as free of human disturbance as possible, careful cutting may favour biodiversity in such areas. However, the use of heavy machinery during cutting operations may have a negative impact on protected forests. The large oaks (Quercus spp.) found in many temperate nature reserves have a rich associated biodiversity. In 25 conservation forests in Sweden, the basal area growth and mortality of 250 large oaks (31-110 cm DBH) were compared between plots that were partially cut to promote the growth and survival of oaks and undisturbed plots. Each forest had one treatment plot (1 ha) and one undisturbed reference plot (1 ha) with similar levels of canopy cover. In 2002-2003, about 25% of the basal area was harvested in treatment plots, thereby increasing canopy openness from 14% to 33%. Cutting increased the mean relative basal area growth of large oaks (49% by plot, 22% by tree) after four seasons (P = 0.026). However, in nine forests, the growth rate was not higher in the treated plot than in the reference plot. Mortality, apparently due to cutting, was recorded only in one forest, where 18 large oaks died. Tree condition (percentage of dead large branches in crown) was the best (negative) predictor of growth rate, and openness around oak crown was also a (positive) predictor. Partial cutting favoured the growth of oaks and may be recommended, but a "hands-off'' policy is also effective for these conservation forests.

AB  - Background: Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion.
   Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested.
   Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species' habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power.
   Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species' response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia. Given that a broader set of biodiversity aspects are to be protected, best overall biodiversity impacts for a variety of species at landscape level can be achieved by ensuring that there is a mosaic of different forests within landscapes.

AB  - Climate change is an important issue that increasingly affects our lives. One of the proposals for mitigating climate change is fighting biodiversity loss, which can support climate mitigation and adaptation actions. In Poland, the possibility of excluding large tracts of forest areas from use is being considered. The discussed the exclusion of forest land from use will affect the timber supply and market, especially for broadleaved wood. The main purpose of this analysis is to present a timber supply forecast, with a particular focus on the possibility of obtaining broadleaved hardwood timber in Poland from forests managed by State Forests National Forest Holding under three scenarios that assume different criteria for selecting forest areas for protection. The work was divided into two main phases: (1) the analysis of historical sales volume of wood products and average sale prices of hardwood during the period 2011-2020; (2) the preparation of a forecast of the potential possibility of maintaining broadleaved hardwood production in the three decades between 2020 and 2049. In the forecast, it was assumed that about 2.7 million hectares of planted and production forests are excluded from use in order to implement the provisions of the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy. In Scenario "I", the supply of merchantable broadleaved roundwood volume will be reduced to 14%-18% that of Scenario "0". In Scenario "II", 55% of the "0" scenario is harvested, and in Scenario "III", 33%-37% of the "0" scenario merchantable broadleaved roundwood is harvested. The introduction of restrictions on timber harvesting as a result of Poland's compliance with European Union requirements in the area of environmental protection will lead to a significant reduction in the supply of timber on the market. This may lead to a further increase in timber prices and an increase in the importance of large timber buyers at the expense of local buyers. The recommendations contained in the policy objectives that the EU sets for the states should be supported by a thorough analysis when selecting areas for strict protection.

AB  - Despite political efforts, diffuse pollution from agriculture continues to be the single largest source of nitrogen (N) emissions into the aquatic environment in many countries and regions. This fact, and the recent enactment of a new Swedish environmental code, led to the design of a study targeted at the evaluation of new N pollution abatement strategies. An actor game was chosen as the key component of the study, with a focus on four major goals: to test the implementability of legally binding environmental quality standards for nitrate concentration in groundwater and N transport to the sea, to find sets of agriculturally feasible and cost-effective measures to decrease N loads, to investigate the possibilities for collective action through negotiated and institutionalized actor cooperation, and to investigate the role of mathematical modeling in environmental N management. Characteristics from the agriculturally dominated catchment of Genevadsan (224 km(2)) on the southwest coast of Sweden served as the playing field for the actor game. The most noteworthy result from the study was that it appeared to be possible to meet ambitious environmental N standards with less economically drastic measures than anticipated by most of the participants. The actor game was shown to be a good method for learning about the new Swedish environmental code and its application and for gaining deeper insight into the issues of N management. In addition, the actor game functioned as an arena for gaining a more thorough understanding of the views of different stakeholders.

AB  - The pH, electrical conductance and concentration of six anions and 33 cations were determined in stream waters sampled in 1994 from eight arctic catchments on and adjacent to the Kola Peninsula (Russia, Finland and Norway). The catchments are located at various distances (5-300 km) from the major industrial emissions centres of Monchegorsk, Nikel and Zapoljarniy in Russia. The source of the elements can be (1) natural, marine (sea spray), (2) natural, geogenic (blowing soil/dust, till, bedrock), and/or (3) anthropogenic, industrial (emissions from smelters, dust from mining, etc.), each source showing a distinct signature. The median concentration of many contaminants can vary by up to three orders of magnitude from polluted to remote locations, and the concentration ranges observed in different catchments often do not overlap. This implies that contamination falls sharply with distance from source, but is quite profound and lasting close to the emission centres. Elevated trace metal contents in the most polluted streams indicates that deposited contaminants are transferred to the aquatic ecosystem, and eventually can reach the ocean.

AB  - Biodiversity informatics is a new and evolving field, requiring efforts to develop capacity and a curriculum for this field of science. The main objective was to summarise the level of activity and the efforts towards developing biodiversity informatics curricula, for work-based training and/or academic teaching at universities, taking place within the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) countries and its associated network. A survey approach was used to identify existing capacities and resources within the network. Most of GBIF Nodes survey respondents (80%) are engaged in onsite training activities, with a focus on work-based professionals, mostly researchers, policy-makers and students. Training topics include data mobilisation, digitisation, management, publishing, analysis and use, to enable the accessibility of analogue and digital biological data that currently reside as scattered datasets. An initial assessment of academic teaching activities highlighted that countries in most regions, to varying degrees, were already engaged in the conceptualisation, development and/or implementation of formal academic programmes in biodiversity informatics, including programmes in Benin, Colombia, Costa Rica, Finland, France, India, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan and Togo. Digital e-learning platforms were an important tool to help build capacity in many countries. In terms of the potential in the Nodes network, 60% expressed willingness to be recruited or commissioned for capacity enhancement purposes. Contributions and activities of various country nodes across the network have been highlighted and a working curriculum framework has been defined.

In doing so, we provide a novel approach to measure learning and address an important methodological and empirical challenge in assessments of learning processes in decision-making contexts. Findings from this study highlight the effectiveness of different measures of learning, and how to differentiate the factors that foster learning with the outcomes of learning. Our approach provides a useful reference point for future empirical studies of learning in different environment, resource and sustainability settings. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The effort of boreal forest conservation has emphasised the preservation of old-growth forests while the role of young successional stages in maintaining biodiversity has remained largely unstudied. We compared the richness of beetle species and composition of species assemblages between managed and seminatural forests in five stages of forest succession. The sites were in boreal sub-xeric pine-dominated forests in eastern Finland. Seminatural study sites, especially the recently burned sites, were important habitats for threatened and near-threatened species. We propose that young stages of natural succession should be included in the network of protected forest areas. On the other hand, the composition of saproxylic species assemblages in seminatural forests differed from the assemblages in managed forests, indicating also the need to improve the forest management guidelines so that they better address the requirements of species protection. Regeneration methods applied should resemble or mimic the natural disturbances more closely. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a process involving splitting of continuous habitats into smaller, and more isolated habitat patches. To assess the effects of small-scale habitat patchiness and isolation without the confounding effect of habitat loss on benthic macrofauna, two field experiments were conducted in the Archipelago Sea, SW Finland. Using artificial seagrass units (ASUs) we contrasted continuous patches ("C") with fragmented patches ("F") of the same combined area as the continuous patches. The fragmentation treatment involved two isolation distances (0.5 and 3.0 m) between the ASUs ("F 0.5") and ("F 3.0"). This design was repeated in two consecutive experiments where the patch area was 0.25 and 0.0625 m(2), respectively. Mobile epifauna were allowed to colonize patches for 12 days in both experiments. In both experiments, the total epifaunal density was significantly higher in the "F 0.5" treatment than in the "C" treatment, and the three dominant taxa showed positive or neutral responses to the habitat configuration. No fragmentation effect on the number of species was detected in either of the experiments, but fragmentation had a negative effect on the epifaunal diversity (Shannon's H') in the experiment with the largest patch area. Epifaunal diversity was significantly lower in "F 3.0" treatment than in "C" or "F 0.5" treatments in the first experiment, indicating stronger effect of isolation instead of fragmentation per se. Edge effects were indirectly tested by comparing epifaunal densities with patch edge: area ratios. The results suggest that edge effects may have a more important role than patch size for the total densities of epifaunal taxa, and that small, isolated patches have equal or higher habitat value compared to larger fragments.

AB  - Current archaeological evidence indicates the transition from hunting-fishing-gathering to agriculture in Northern Europe was a gradual process. This transition was especially complex in the prehistoric North Fennoscandian landscape where the high latitude posed a challenge to both domestic animal breeding and cereal cultivation. The conditions varied, the coastal dwellers had access to rich marine resources and enjoyed a milder climate due to the Gulf Stream, while those living in the inland Boreal forest zone faced longer and colder winters and less diversity in animal and plant resources. Thus, the coastal area provided more favourable conditions for early agriculture compared to those found inland. Interestingly, a cultural differentiation between these areas is archaeologically visible from the late 2nd millennium BC onwards. This is most clearly seen in regionally distinct pottery styles, offering unique opportunities to probe diet and subsistence through the organic residues preserved in ceramic vessels. Herein, we integrate the lipid biomarker, compound-specific stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13), and zooarchaeological evidence to reveal culturally distinct human diets and subsistence patterns. In northern Norway, some of the coastal people adopted dairying as part of their subsistence strategy, while the inhabitants of the interior, in common with northern Finland, continued their hunter-gatherer-fisher lifestyles.

AB  - In Sweden one forestry method, the clear-cutting method, has been used all over the country despite differences in climate, topography etc. At present there is a growing interest in using alternative methods such as selective felling, which to a larger extent mimic natural disturbances. In this study we compare virgin forests with stands which have been cut with old selective felling (dimension felling), new selective felling (single tree selection felling), and clear-cutting with respect to frequency of characters important to biodiversity (mainly dead wood). The frequency of different types of dead wood decreases with increasing intensity of the cutting method in the following order: old selective felling, new selective felling, and clear-cutting. New selective felling had higher amounts and quality of dead wood compared to clear-cutting. New selective felling also showed less differences compared to virgin forests than clear-cutting. Dead wood in new selective felling compared to clear-cutting may offer substrate for different types of faunas because of the environment surrounding the dead wood. Even if the new selective felling method seems to provide higher amounts of dead wood compared to the clear-cutting method, further studies of organisms utilising the dead wood are needed. New selective felling does not seem to solve the problem of decreasing availability of dead wood in managed forests and there is still a need to preserve unmanaged forest patches in a landscape perspective in order to offer habitats with a high amount of dead wood.

AB  - The role of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in local economies differ in time and space. We analysed Ukrainian and Swedish national policies and management rules related to the use of NWFPs, and described how different forest stakeholders utilised NWFPs in rural areas in Ukraine and Sweden. In total we interviewed 114 local forest stakeholders in one rural region's settlements in both countries. The topics for the field study were (1) the reasons and amounts of NWFPs harvested by different forest user categories; (2) traditional practices of NWFP use, including harvesting methods and (3) how these practices have changed over the past decades. At the national level, both countries allowed the utilisation of most NWFPs, did not regulate the use, and did not include NWFPs into forest management plans. In both case studies, historical use of NWFPs was intensive. This use remained important in Ukraine, but not in Sweden. Due to difficult economic transition in Ukraine, use of NWFPs by locals has increased. While hunting as a tradition was more popular in the Swedish case study, recreational use of forest was popular in both case studies. Finally, we discuss the role of NWFPs in countries with transition and market economies, and the extent to which the countries support sustainable use of NWFPs.

AB  - Winter sports resorts in general, and cross-country skiing destinations in particular, will need to address the impacts of climate change in the near future. This study uses the results of a discrete choice experiment to investigate likely skier responses to various destination scenarios under possible adaptation strategies to climate change. The heterogeneity of skiers is accounted for in a latent class model resulting in three segments of Austrian and Finnish skiers respectively. The results show that it is less risky for Austrian destinations to introduce technical adaptation, as well as to expand into additional offers, compared to Finland. The main reasons seem to be the strong tradition of cross-country skiing in Finland combined with a clear aversion toward user fees. The study serves as an example for using results of a stated choice survey to evaluate future destination scenarios and provide market intelligence for management and target marketing.

AB  - The need for quantification of land cover from pollen data has led to the development of a Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA). The LRA includes several models of which the REVEALS model estimates regional vegetation abundance using pollen assemblages from large sites (lakes or bogs). In this paper we explore the effects of selection and number of pollen samples, and choice of pollen productivity estimates on the REVEALS results. The effect of the size of vegetation surveys is also tested. The results suggest that the differences between two sizes of vegetation surveys have little effect on the model validation. The "characteristic radius" of regional vegetation in southern Sweden was estimated as 200 km. However, the vegetation composition in a 100 x 100 km(2) square matches well with that estimated by REVEALS. Whether 25, 20 (outliers excluded) or 4 pollen samples are used does not change the REVEALS reconstructions much although the error estimates are larger when outliers are included, and very large when only four samples are used. Therefore validation of the REVEALS model and REVEALS reconstructions of past vegetation can be performed using a limited number of pollen samples, although with caution. The use of many pollen samples from multiple sites is always better whenever possible. REVEALS reconstructions are closer to the actual vegetation when the Danish Pollen Productivity Estimates (PPEs) are used instead of the Swedish PPEs for Cereals, Rumex acetosa/acetosella, Plantago lanceolata and Calluna, indicating that the Danish PPEs are more reliable than the Swedish ones for those taxa. It is recommended to test more than one set of PPEs in validation and applications of the REVEALS model for a better evaluation of the results.

AB  - This article investigates the construction of instruments and techniques employed in the management of Norwegian wolves since the early 1980s by construing the tools as technologies of government. The proliferation of such instruments and techniques, constructed to effect protection in practice, has transformed Norwegian wolves in significant ways. Unlike the historic population, which often went through large variations in numbers and was spread throughout large parts of the country, the current population of wolves is regulated to stay at a fixed number and within a relatively small wolf-zone. The current population is also highly amenable to detailed government; the number and location of the wolves, and even the genetic composition of the population over the longer term, can be reconfigured in detail. The article further argues that the general proliferation of governmental technologies in biodiversity conservation has meant similar transformations of a great number of endangered organisms.

The study is based on a literature review and field studies, including semi-structured interviews. The results show that the conceptions held by the various actors are largely complementary. the most important divergence between them concerning time. The time perspective of local politicians is shorter than that of researchers and practitioners A long-term perspective needs to be reinforced in decision making and planning to encourage research and development (R&D) for both technology and organizational structures to be better able to meet the sustainability challenges that urban water systems face. This reinforcement partly concerns fostering better understanding between different groups of actors. for example. through the joint (re)development of visions of and strategies foi sustainable development, but also concerns clarifying at the national level how R&D in the Swedish water sector should be organized and financed.

AB  - Large-scale variation in mammalian body size has often been found to be related to environmental conditions. A general finding among large herbivores is that body size increases with decreasing temperature (Bergmann's rule), because animals with larger body size have better heat conservation or fasting tolerance, or because higher quality forage occurs in colder environments. Using a data set on the skeletal morphology of Norwegian red deer (Artiodactyla, Cervidae: Cervus elaphus) spanning the last approximately 7,100 years, we document an inverse relationship between climatic conditions and body size. The size of Norwegian red deer, as estimated from both teeth and weight-bearing bones, was significantly larger during the warmer and wetter middle Holocene than it is today. However, the reduction in body size does not seem to be related to changing climatic conditions. Rather, this decrease happened during a period of large-scale human-mediated habitat fragmentation, increased populations of domestic herbivores, and heavy hunting pressure that reduced population density. The size of teeth was reduced as much as, or even more than, the size of weight-bearing bones, which indicates an evolutionary response rather than phenotypic plasticity to changing forage and environmental conditions. Decreased body size may be a general response in wild ungulates to a more human-dominated landscape, resulting from reduced access to optimal habitats and high adult hunting mortality.

AB  - Several Norwegian mountain and coastal municipalities have experienced comprehensive second-home development in recent decades. From a sustainability perspective, it is necessary to understand both the importance of various geographical locations within a local context, as the location has an impact on available resources, amenities, and courses of action, and the complex interdependencies between the three sustainability pillars: economy, society, and environment. The purpose of the article is to provide knowledge on why and how various locations matter for planning sustainable second-home tourism. The analysis is based on document studies and interviews from three Norwegian destinations, supplemented with official statistics. The findings indicate that emphasis on, and development challenges associated with, the sustainability pillars differ across locations. They also indicate that local capacities to assess, plan, and implement adequate measures to address specific sustainable development challenges vary. Hence, there is a need for regional and local authorities to reflect on the driving forces behind the development of second-home tourism, as the impacts vary depending on what and who is driving the development. The authors conclude that it matters where second-home development is planned and what sustainability measures are adequate, applicable, and available. Nevertheless, all three pillars must be considered even if just one is enhanced.

AB  - Traditional gene-resource management programs for forest trees are long-term endeavors requiring sustained organizational commitment covering extensive landscapes. While successful in maintaining adaptation, genetic diversity and capturing traditional growth attributes gains, these programs are dependent on rigid methods requiring elaborate mating schemes, thus making them slow in coping with climate change challenges. Here, we review the significance of Norway spruce in the boreal region and its current management practices. Next, we discuss opportunities offered by novel technologies and, with the use of computer simulations, we propose and evaluate a dynamic landscape gene-resource management in Norway. Our suggested long-term management approach capitalizes on: (1) existing afforestation activities, natural crosses, and DNA-based pedigree assembly to create structured pedigree for evaluation, thus traditional laborious control crosses are avoided and (2) landscape level genetic evaluation, rather than localized traditional progeny trials, allowing for screening of adapted individuals across multiple environmental gradients under changing climate. These advantages lead to greater genetic response to selection in adaptive traits without the traditional breeding and testing scheme, facilitating conservation of genetic resources within the breeding population of the most important forest tree species in Norway. The use of in situ selection from proven material exposed to realistic conditions over vast territories has not been conducted in forestry before. Our proposed approach is in contrast to worldwide current programs, where genetic evaluation is constrained by the range of environments where testing is conducted, which may be insufficient to capture the broad environmental variation necessary to tackle adaptation under changing climate.

AB  - For over 40years, acid deposition has been recognized as a serious international environmental problem, but efforts to restore acidified streams and biota have had limited success. The need to better understand the effects of different sources of acidity on streams has become more pressing with the recent increases in surface water organic acids, or brownification,' associated with climate change and decreased inorganic acid deposition. Here, we carried out a large scale multi-seasonal investigation in the Adirondacks, one of the most acid-impacted regions in the United States, to assess how acid stream producers respond to local and watershed influences and whether these influences can be used in acidification remediation. We explored the pathways of wetland control on aluminum chemistry and diatom taxonomic and functional composition. We demonstrate that streams with larger watershed wetlands have higher organic content, lower concentrations of acidic anions, and lower ratios of inorganic to organic monomeric aluminum, all beneficial for diatom biodiversity and guilds producing high biomass. Although brownification has been viewed as a form of pollution, our results indicate that it may be a stimulating force for biofilm producers with potentially positive consequences for higher trophic levels. Our research also reveals that the mechanism of watershed control of local stream diatom biodiversity through wetland export of organic matter is universal in running waters, operating not only in hard streams, as previously reported, but also in acid streams. Our findings that the negative impacts of acid deposition on Adirondack stream chemistry and biota can be mitigated by wetlands have important implications for biodiversity conservation and stream ecosystem management. Future acidification research should focus on the potential for wetlands to improve stream ecosystem health in acid-impacted regions and their direct use in stream restoration, for example, through stream rechanneling or wetland construction in appropriate hydrologic settings.

AB  - Fishing and translocation of marine species for use in aquaculture is widespread. Corkwing, goldsinny, and ballan wrasse (Symphodus melops, Ctenolabrus rupestris, and Labrus bergylta) are fished on the Swedish west coast for use as cleaner-fish in Norwegian salmon farms. Here, we aim to provide knowledge and recommendations to support ecosystem-based management for wrasse fisheries in Sweden. We compared fished and non-fished areas to test if current fishery levels have led to stock depletion. To gain insight on the role of wrasse in the algal belt trophic chain, we analysed the gut contents of goldsinny and corkwing using metabarcoding. Finally, we analysed the trophic interactions of wrasse and potential prey in a mesocosm study. We could not detect any signs of stock depletion or altered size structure in fished areas compared to the protected control area. Gut analyses confirmed both goldsinny and corkwing as non-specialized, omnivorous opportunists and revealed, with 189 prey taxa detected, a broader spectrum of prey than previously known. Common prey items included mesoherbivores such as small gastropods and crustaceans, but also insects and algae. We conclude that there are no visible signs of stock depletion at the current removal level of wrasses by the fishery. However, this emerging fishery should be closely monitored for potential cascading effects on the algal belt ecosystem, and our study could provide a baseline for future monitoring.

AB  - The role of emotions within extractive industries has been acknowledged and embraced in recent years, though security studies research on it remains limited. This article argues that to better understand narratives of everyday security, the role of emotions should be acknowledged. I focus on an Arctic locality in northern Norway, and on local experiences and emotions surrounding everyday securities and insecurities of having an oil and gas production site nearby. The Arctic oil and gas industry is important economically for local communities; however, it also accelerates global climate change. The article scrutinizes interviews collected from local people and concludes that security narratives are complex and conflicted, portraying various stories about having the petroleum industry in one's neighbourhood. The narratives express concern and worry for the environment while expressing gratitude to the economic benefits of the industry. The Arctic communities have been tied to the global oil and gas market while being forced to find new means to cope with the change. Contributing to the wider discussion on the local security impacts of extractivist projects, as well as further developing the concept of human security, I argue that the role of emotions cannot be ignored.

AB  - Establishment of artificial reefs and no-take areas are management measures available for restoring deteriorated marine ecosystems, compensating for habitat loss and strengthening harvested populations. Following the establishment of no-take artificial reefs in western Sweden to compensate for hard bottoms lost to a shipping lane, we detected rapid positive effects on crustaceans and demersal fish compared to fished reference areas. The relative abundance and size structure of European lobster (Homarus gammarus) increased strongly in the no-take area indicating more than doubled and tripled egg production in 5 and 10 years, respectively. For benthic fish and crustacean communities, the abundances of gadoids and wrasses increased and the abundances of small decapod crustaceans decreased in the no-take area, likely indicating cascading effects of increased predation. The study demonstrates that relatively small no-take areas, enhanced by artificial reefs, can rapidly invigorate populations of lobster and fish that in turn may re-initiate local top-down control.

AB  - This study examined how species richness of butterflies with differing population trends is affected by land cover and climate. Generalized linear models (GLM) with land cover, climate and geographical location as explanatory variables were constructed to explain variation in species richness of declining, stable and increasing butterflies in 10-km squares in Finland. The largest part of explained variation in species richness of all the three butterfly trend categories was related to spatially structured climate variables and pure geographical location. However, the relative importance of climate and land cover differed between the butterfly categories. Pure and spatially structured climate variables explained two-fold more variation in species richness in increasing butterflies than in stable and declining butterflies. On the other hand, pure and spatially structured land cover variables explained 2.5-6 times more variation in species richness in declining butterflies than in stable and increasing butterflies. Land cover variables differed in their effects on the species richness of the three trend categories: the amount of grassland had the greatest positive effect on the number of declining species, whereas the amount of forest was the most important land cover variable for species richness of stable butterflies and arable land and field-forest mosaic for species richness of increasing butterflies. The results suggest that habitat availability has the greatest effect on the trends of declining butterfly species, and climate in concert with habitat availability on the trends of increasing species.

AB  - Analyzing the population dynamic consequences of spatio-temporal changes in landscape structure is a formidable challenge for spatial ecology. One key population dynamic process in fragmented landscapes is the influence of isolation on colonization rate and thereby on the occurrence of species in habitat fragments, but it is not obvious how isolation should be measured in landscapes that are affected by on-going habitat loss and fragmentation. We suggest the following procedure for the measurement of spatio-temporal isolation. First, a historical record of habitat loss and fragmentation in the landscape is prepared based on snapshots of the extent of the suitable habitat for the focal species. Second, a metapopulation model is used to simulate the occurrence of the species in this landscape, assuming the empirically observed landscape change. The model-predicted pattern of habitat occupancy at a particular point in time (usually the present time) is then compared with empirical observations on the occurrence of the species. We describe a metapopulation model that has been constructed for this purpose, and we apply it to a changing landscape of boreal forests in eastern Finland. We give an example on the occurrence of four threatened polyporous fungi in 18 small fragments of old-growth forest. In none of the species does the current isolation of the fragments nor the time since their isolation explain the occurrence of the species in the study fragments, but in three species the model-predicted occupancy probability had a significant effect on the observed abundance of the species. The model-predicted occupancy probabilities were also calculated by ignoring past landscape changes, that is, by assuming that the landscape had remained in the present configuration for a long time. These probabilities had a significant effect on the abundance of only one of the four species, suggesting that the occurrence of the species tracks landscapes changes with a noticable time lag.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that climate warming will allow southern species to advance north and invade northern ecosystems. We review the changes in the Swedish mammal and bird community in boreal forest and alpine tundra since the nineteenth century, as well as suggested drivers of change. Observed changes include (1) range expansion and increased abundance in southern birds, ungulates, and carnivores; (2) range contraction and decline in northern birds and carnivores; and (3) abundance decline or periodically disrupted dynamics in cyclic populations of small and medium-sized mammals and birds. The first warm spell, 1930-1960, stands out as a period of substantial faunal change. However, in addition to climate warming, suggested drivers of change include land use and other anthropogenic factors. We hypothesize all these drivers interacted, primarily favoring southern generalists. Future research should aim to distinguish between effects of climate and land-use change in boreal and tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Human-driven wildlife mortality is caused by both indirect causes and direct persecution due to conflicts of interests. The wolf, a predator frequently at risk from human-wildlife conflict, is returning to areas where it was historically extirpated in Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway). The wolf is expanding via a management strategy that allows wolves to reproduce exclusively in a wolf breeding range (WBR) in the south-central region. We modelled wolf territory occurrence in the WBR and all of Scandinavia, accounting for biotic and anthropogenic variables, and we also modelled the occurrence of human-driven mortality (traffic collisions, culling and illegal killing). We integrated territory distribution and mortality models in a two-dimensional model estimating habitat suitability and mortality risk for wolves. Forest was the main variable driving territory occurrence, and mortality was a consequence of variables associated with traffic infrastructure, human population, prey densities, and wolf management levels. Only < 0.1% of the WBR was not characterized by these risks. Our results confirm that human-related conflicts resulting in wolf mortality occur wherever the species is present, which leads to actions to control the population expansion. Considering the adaptability of wolves and the presence of potential suitable habitat in Scandinavia, their survival and expansion will be dependent on changes in public attitudes about illegal killing, and a review of policies and management actions. Our framework can be used to assist management of human-wildlife conflicts of recolonizing wolves elsewhere, or of other species at high risk from human-induced mortality.

AB  - "The Swedish forestry model" refers to the forest regime that evolved following the 1993 revision of the Swedish Forestry Act. It is key to Swedish forest politics and used to capture the essence of a sustainable way of managing forests. However, the ideas, institutions and practices comprising the model have not been comprehensively analyzed previously. Addressing this knowledge gap, we use frame analysis and a Pathways approach to investigate the underlying governance model, focusing on the way policy problems are addressed, goals, implementation procedures, outcomes and the resulting pathways to sustainability. We suggest that the institutionally embedded response to pressing sustainability challenges and increasing demands is expansion, inclusion and integration: more of everything. The more-of-everything pathway is influenced by ideas of ecological modernization and the optimistic view that existing resources can be increased. Our findings suggest that in effect it prioritizes the economic dimension of sustainability. While broadening out policy formulation it closes down the range of alternative outputs, a shortcoming that hampers its capacity to respond to current sustainability challenges. Consequently, there is a need for a broad public debate regarding not only the role of forests in future society, but also the operationalization of sustainable development. (C) 2015 The Authors.

KW  - sustainable development
AB  - Entrepreneurship is considered a central force of economic development, as it generates growth and serves as a vehicle for innovation and change., Tourism is one of the economic sectors in which a great degree of involvement is needed by the entrepreneurial sector: diversification of tourism products and services is needed to cope with increased demand for new types of tourism needs. These include opportunities for more sustainable tourism. The Soderslatt region of Sweden, which is used as a case study, is a newborn tourist destination with lots of natural and cultural characteristics. It is also one of the most agriculture intensive areas in Sweden where a potential for rural entrepreneurship development can be identified. However, the entrepreneurial culture and climate Was poor in the region. This is due to the social pressure that is characteristic for this rural community. This paper shows the results of a SWOT analysis of Soderslatt tourism entrepreneurship development, which gives an overview of their current entrepreneurial situation. The case of a family-based enterprise, "Healthy Pig Farm" is presented as an example of a successful, innovative entrepreneur in farm tourism. Moreover, based on the findings and analyses, several recommendations are proposed to overcome obstacles for sustainable entrepreneurship development in rural tourist areas. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Extant literature point to difficulties related to enabling transitions to sustainable tourism development. Supplementing hereto, this study explored how we may collaboratively design (co-design) opportunities for sustainable tourism futures. Based on fieldwork involving co-designing tourism with a diverse range of practitioners centred on Lake Mjosa in Norway, it unfolds how an understanding and construction of 'Our Mjosa' surfaced. By analysing the contingent processes and ensuing outcomes, the study introduces a framework for understanding how opportunities may - and may not - emerge and enable sustainable development. The framework comprises four dynamic zones including two of inertia, one of sustaining tourism and one of re-imagining tourism. The study argues that traditional tourism approaches often are located within zones of inertia and sustaining tourism and consequently overlook or fail to engage series of opportunities for sustainability transitions. Within the latter zone of re-imagining tourism, it shows how opportunities can emerge as 'yours and mine', together as our sustainable tourism futures. Altogether, the findings suggest that the ongoing tempo-spatial shifts and flows on the verges of inertia, sustaining tourism and re-imagining tourism allow for simultaneously revealing and making more transparent the implicit and explicit assumptions underpinning current tourism practice, while re-imagining our sustainable tourism futures.

AB  - The magnitude of the diffuse leakage of metals (AI, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) from Finnish acid sulfate soils (AS soils) into streams was assessed and then compared to the metal discharges in effluent from Finnish industry. The diffuse leakage was calculated by using median metal concentrations for a total of 30 ditches draining AS soils and the mean annual runoff from such soils. In comparison to the present-day industrial discharges, AS soils are a massive supplier of AI, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn to the aquatic environment. Also Cu exists abundantly in runoff from such soils, while Pb, Cr, Fe, As, and V in. general do not. Since the AS soils are. anthropogenic (developed as a result of deep ditching for farming purposes), the comparison with industry is justified and shows that there is an urgent need to take measures against the extensive metal leakage from these soils. It is likely that high quantities of metals are leached, in a similar manner, from corresponding soils distributed in many coastal plains worldwide.

AB  - Transition to a low-carbon economy to achieve the Paris Agreement goal requires substantial investments. The green bond market shows good potential to help mobilize financial sources towards sustainable investments. In this paper, we compare the uptake of green bonds in Norway and Sweden from 2013 till 2019, with the aim to understand what drives the green bond market. Our study is one of the first comparative analyses specifically designed to explain differences in green bond uptake between two similar financial markets. The analysis can help us to identify factors that are transferable to other countries and that therefore can be important for facilitating the growth of green bonds in different markets. Data shows that there has been a faster growth in issuances in Sweden than Norway, and especially for the corporate sector and municipalities. When interviewing experienced green bond market participants in Norway and Sweden, we find that likely explanations are a business culture and financial institutions more focused on sustainability in Sweden, as well as a larger and more diversified corporate sector. In Norway, green bonds uptake may have been hampered by competition with high yield investments in oil & gas and shipping, a 'green' energy sector that considers green bonds to be superfluous, and many municipalities that are too small for green bond issuance. The experience from Sweden indicates that other countries wanting to facilitate uptake of green bonds should emphasize leadership on sustainability, collaboration between green bond issuers and investors, and active communication, high visibility, and thorough disclosure of sustainable finance activities.

AB  - 1. The governments of Norway and Indonesia are collaborating on a REDD+ partnership that would contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and peatland conversion in Indonesia. Part of this agreement requires Indonesia to implement a 2-year moratorium to suspend the issuance of new permits for conversion of peat and natural forests for forestry or agriculture. 2. This partnership offers an unprecedented opportunity for Indonesia to mitigate its deforestation and carbon emission levels. However, it has also galvanized intense debates within Indonesian society regarding the scope of the moratorium and its consequent environmental and socioeconomic ramifications. 3. We developed a web-based application for evaluating the implications and trade-offs of implementing Indonesia's forest moratorium in Kalimantan. This spatially explicit tool quantifies the moratorium's benefits for carbon conservation and its opportunity costs under alternative userdefinedmoratoriumscenarios. This application could serve as a useful framework for understanding the costs and benefits of REDD+ implementation across Indonesia and other forest-rich tropical nations.

AB  - This article addresses cultural and other forms of appropriation related to tourism in the Sami areas of Norway (Sapmi). Tourists are chasing and consuming otherness - places, culture and nature different from their home environments. Thus, exposures of arts, culture, nature and places are vital parts of tourism production. Within this context, indigenous cultures are praised. When the use of land and culture is conducted by those from outside the culture, appropriation take place, and it is shown how this occurs in different ways within Sami tourism. The article is based on a Nordic research project, where the relations between tourism and Sami culture were addressed. Tourism providers were interviewed. Through these conversations, cultural appropriation came up as one of the challenging issues. Some of the topics and examples given are referred to in the empirical part of the article. The interview data are supplemented by observations and media clips from recent years. In the discussion part, ambiguities, ambivalences, and complexities related to the tourism-culture nexus are discussed. The article is a contribution to this discourse, addressing issues to be aware of, both in the production and the analysis of indigenous tourism.

AB  - Norwegian mountain forests represent interesting sources of wood biomass for bioenergy. This case study gives a life cycle assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs of forest management, harvest and transport operations in the mountainous areas of Hedmark and Oppland counties in Norway. Low-intensity forest management characterizes the study sites. The study shows that transportation to the terminal is the operation with the highest GHG impacts in the examined supply chain and that the bundling of forest residues has the highest financial cost. The mountain forest system analyzed emits 17,600 g CO(2)e per solid cubic meter over bark. Transportation to the terminal accounts for 31% of the emissions and 23% of the costs, while bundling accounts for 25% of the total emissions and 19% of the total costs. The study shows that there is a considerable quantity of woody biomass available for bioenergy purpose from mountain areas. In the short term, it is possible to integrate harvesting of logging residues in the conventional logging operations. However, it is necessary to improve forest management, logistic and technology for reducing emissions and operative costs, ensuring the achievement of a sustainable system at the same time.

AB  - One of the most dramatic landscape changes during the 20th century in Sweden, like in most of Europe, has been the reduction and fragmentation of semi-natural grasslands. Using a set of remnant semi-natural grasslands, chosen to be as similar as possible, but differing in size, we have examined whether size of remnant fragments of traditionally managed semi-natural grasslands in Sweden is related to patterns of species richness and composition. We focused on edge-to-interior relationships, since we expected that a possible impact from invasive habitat generalists would be manifested in a gradient from the edge of fragments to their interior. We found no relationship between size of grassland fragments and (a) overall species richness, (b) species richness at different spatial scales, and (c) abundance of some typical invader species or species characteristic of semi-natural grasslands. However, the results indicated that larger grasslands have a comparatively larger number of species in the edges, whereas the opposite pattern was found in smaller grasslands. The similarity in species composition between the edge and the interior of the pastures also increased with grassland size. Thus, even though the overall species richness is still unaffected by reduction in grassland fragment size, the edges of smaller grasslands show signs of degradation, i.e. reduction in species richness and a decreased similarity to the grassland interior. We suggest that these kinds of effects may be early signs of fragmentation effects that in the future will result in species loss even if the present distribution of semi-natural grasslands is maintained.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method to quantify the market equilibrium impacts of tighter environmental policies. The approach is taken to evaluate the welfare effects of emerging environmental regulations to protect the biodiversity of river ecosystems that put pressure on reducing hydropower generation capacity. A dataset of 129 million bids in the Nordic electricity market is used to calculate how small reductions in hydropower capacity change market outcomes and surpluses hour-by-hour for the years 2011-2022. Reaching the EU Biodiversity Strategy target of 2030 is estimated to reduce 56 MW of hydropower capacity in Finland. Such a change would lead to quantifiable welfare losses of euro62 million over time, not counting environmental benefits. Notably, the producer surplus increases by euro318 million over time through electricity market price changes, suggesting that instead of lobbying against biodiversity enhancing regulation, agreeing to an industry-wide implementation could benefit both the environment and the firms. Yet the fact that consumer costs increase more than the mere implementation cost reads as a sign of caution when tighter biodiversity policies are introduced.

AB  - Managing nutrient flows to urban lakes is one of the main challenges to environmental sustainability in cities. Considering that future urban and climate changes may increase the challenge of handling future eutrophication, prediction of future nutrient loadings to aquatic environments in urban catchments has become increasingly important. Based on a new, innovative, structured Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) approach, where a source model was coupled to a Generalised Watershed Loading Functions (GWLF) model, this study investigated nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) delivery from sources to a water recipient for an urban catchment, using the case of Racksta Trask in Stockholm, Sweden, as an example. Potential effects from future changes in atmospheric deposition, vehicle volume and land use and from climate change (temperature and precipitation) were examined by comparing model scenarios in two periods (2000-2009 and 2050-2059). Model results suggested that climate change may have a greater impact on nitrogen loading to Racksta Trask lake than increasing vehicle volume and land use change. In addition, the results suggested that nitrogen loading to the lake may increase taking into account all changes examined, despite the expected decrease in background atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. In contrast, a marginal impact was found for phosphorus loading to the lake under all scenarios examined, resulting in only a slight increase in the combined scenario. From a nutrient pathways perspective, the results suggested that major pathways of nutrient loadings to the lake may not be much affected under most future scenarios examined, although groundwater was found to be a potentially sensitive pathway of nitrogen transport in the climate scenario. The model results provided important information for managers who need to plan for future nutrient handling in urban catchments, and the coupled SFA-GWLF model was suggested to be worthy of further testing at other sites and conditions.

AB  - Cycling is a healthy and sustainable form of transportation. The recent increase of daily cyclists in Sweden has triggered broad interest in finding how policies and measures may facilitate the planning of bicycle traffic in the urban area. However, in comparison to car traffic, bicycle traffic is still far from well understood. This study is part of the research effort to investigate microscopic cyclist behavior, model bicycle traffic and finally build a simulation tool for applications in transport planning. In particular, the paper focuses on representing bicycle movements when the cyclist doesn't interact with others. The cyclist acceleration behavior is modeled using naturalistic GPS data collected by eleven recruited commuter cyclists. After filtering the large amount of data, cyclist trajectories are obtained and acceleration profiles are abstracted. A mathematical model is proposed based on the dataset, and three model forms are estimated using the maximum likelihood method with Laplace and Normal error terms. While the model with more parameters shows superior performance, the simplified ones are still capable of capturing the trends in the acceleration profiles. On the other hand, the study also introduces social economic characteristics of cyclists to explain the model parameters and they show significant effects. However, the cyclist population being investigated in the study is still limited, and more convincing results can be obtained when the data collection effort is extended to larger population with more variable cyclist characteristics.

AB  - Detailed descriptions of individual vegetation types shown on vegetation maps can improve the ways in which the composition and spatial structure within the types are understood. The authors therefore examined dwarf shrub heath, a vegetation type covering large areas and found in many parts of the Norwegian mountains. They used data from point samples obtained in a wall-to-wall area frame survey. The point sampling method provided data that gave a good understanding of the composition and structure of the vegetation type, but also revealed a difference between variation within the vegetation type itself (intra-class variation) and variation resulting from the inclusion of other types of vegetation inside the map polygons (landscape variation). Intra-class variation reflected differences in the botanical composition of the vegetation type itself, whereas landscape variation represented differences in the land-cover composition of the broader landscape in which the vegetation type was found. Both types of variation were related to environmental gradients. The authors conclude that integrated point sampling method is an efficient way to achieve increased understanding of the content of a vegetation map and can be implemented as a supporting activity during a survey.

AB  - In Europe, more than 20 billion Euros have been paid to farmers for agri-environment schemes (AESs) during the last half decade to counteract negative effects of farming on the environment. In Sweden alone 0.4 billion Euros are paid to farmers for AESs every year, but large-scale analyses of the relationship between AESs and biodiversity are scarce in northern Europe. We surveyed farmland birds at over 600 sites in non-crop habitats in 37 arable dominated landscapes (each 25 km(2)) in southern Sweden and investigated if bird species richness and abundance were related to the amount of agricultural land receiving subsidies for five common AESs. Abundance and species richness of three subsets of farmland birds were positively associated with AES for management of permanent pastures, and bird abundance was associated to habitat elements managed for the maintenance of nature and cultural values (e.g. old buildings, infield non-crop islands, stone walls and ditches). Farmland bird abundance was also positively associated with the amount of grasslands (leys and especially pastures) and set-aside without subsidies, whereas neither richness nor abundance was positively associated with the amount of organic fields at the local scale (i.e. within a 250 m radius). However, bird diversity was related to increased area of organic fields at the landscape scale (i.e. 25 km(2)); with a positive relationship in the most simplified landscapes but a negative relationship in more complex landscapes (i.e. with less arable land and more woodlands). Our results show that AESs are targeting habitats and habitat elements of high farmland bird diversity with the possible exception of organic farming in less simplified landscapes. Future studies investigating effects of AES management need to collect longitudinal before-after data on the change of biodiversity and need to investigate the possible landscape-dependent outcomes of specific management tied to AESs.

AB  - The state of seafood resources around the world has been declining for the last 50 years. There are multiple global, regional, and national regulatory arrangements that make an effort to revert this situation. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is a voluntary global instrument, believed to foster sustainability in commercial fishing practices. This paper analyzes the institutionalization of MSC in Finland and Russia, and highlights how MSC as a global standard adapts to the different local contexts. It also shows which other global regulatory arrangements contribute to regulating fish production and what are the specifics of interaction between them. For the analysis of the MSC scheme, this paper uses the governance generating network (GGN) theory, which has been widely applied to the research on the FSC forest certification scheme and oil sector. The GGN lens helps to analyze the generative capacity of multiple global regulatory instruments including MSC in the Baltic Sea (Finland) and the Barents Sea (Russia). Qualitative methodology, such as semi-structured interviews with the same interview guide, document analysis, and participant observations were used in both Finland and Russia. We show that several GGNs are contributing to fishing regulations, e.g., the implementation of MSC in both countries is facilitated by multiple international organizations and conventions, which were signed prior to the creation of the MSC scheme. The limited added value of MSC certification is observed in both Finland and Russia: MSC ensures economic stability of certified companies and contributes to biodiversity conservation.

AB  - New forest-biodiversity-protection instruments based on temporary protection periods and non-industrial private forest owners' voluntary participation have been recently introduced and tested in pilot areas located in Southern Finland. Thanks to their several benefits, the use of voluntary instruments is becoming more common in many other countries as well. Voluntary protection here means that forest owners voluntarily set aside tracts of forest to be protected and define their compensation fees. Depending on the objectives of the forest owners, the compensation fee reflects the forest owners' (positive) attitude towards biodiversity, scenic beauty, recreational values and/or the existence of long-term cutting possibilities. When a forest owner decides to offer part of his/her forest holding to be temporarily protected, the owner faces a new decision problem related to definition of the compensation fee, which should be based on diverse information concerning stand- and holding-level opportunity costs as well as on the biodiversity value of the stand. This article introduces three decision-support elements for assisting forest owners in defining their compensation fees. The first element relates to the assessment of the potential stand-level loss of timber harvesting income that the temporary protection of the stand may cause. The second element sets the holding-level opportunity cost of protection by utilizing the forest owners' holding level goals, the holdings' production possibilities and optimization methods. The third element describes the biodiversity value of the stand by means of a multi-criteria expert model. Case study material collected from the area of Central Karelia Herb-rich Forests Network pilot project is used to illustrate the characteristics of the decision-support elements and to point out some development needs for the future use of these elements.

AB  - Soil biological activity was calculated on a daily basis, using standard meteorological data from African weather stations, a simple soil water model, and commonly used assumptions regarding the relations between temperature, soil water content, and biological activity. The activity factor r(e_clim), is calculated from daily soil moisture and temperature, thereby taking the daily interaction between temperature and moisture into account. Annual mean r(e_clim) was normalized to 1 in Central Sweden (clay loam soil, no crop), where the original calibration took place. Since soils vary in water storage capacity and plant cover will affect transpiration, we used this soil under no crop for all sites, thereby only including climate differences. The Swedish r(e_clim) value, 1, corresponds to ca. 50% annual mass loss of, e.g., cereal straw incorporated into the topsoil. African mean annual r(e_clim) values varied between 1.1 at a hot and dry site (Faya, Chad) and 4.7 at a warm and moist site (Brazzaville, Congo). Sites in Kenya ranged between r(e_clim) = 2.1 at high altitude (Matanya) and 4.1 in western Kenya (Ahero). This means that 4.1 times the Swedish C input to soil is necessary to maintain Swedish soil carbon levels in Ahero, if soil type and management are equal. Diagrams showing daily r(e_clim) dynamics are presented for all sites, and differences in within-year dynamics are discussed. A model experiment indicated that a Swedish soil in balance with respect to soil carbon would lose 41% of its soil carbon during 30 y, if moved to Ahero, Kenya. If the soil was in balance in Ahero with respect to soil carbon, and then moved to Sweden, soil carbon mass would increase by 64% in 30 y. The validity of the methodology and results is discussed, and r(e_clim) is compared with other climate indices. A simple method to produce a rough estimate of r(e_clim) is suggested.

AB  - About a quarter of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, forestry and other land use. Few studies of afforested drained peatlands have measured exchanges of all three major greenhouse gases (GHG) at a given site, leading to uncertainty in estimated GHG budgets. Thus, we measured forest floor exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at a well-drained afforested peatland in southern Sweden. The CO2 emissions (76000 kg ha(-1) a(-1); SE 6000) were large compared with previous measurements at similar sites, which may have been partly due to a measurement technique that did not underestimate the flux. A net CH4 uptake of 4.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.41) and a net N2O emission of 2.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.23) were found, which agreed well with published models relating fluxes to stand biomass (CH4 models) or soil C:N ratio (N2O models).

AB  - Finnish hunters, animal welfarists, and scientists started getting organised in the later half of the nineteenth century. In doing so, they became interest groups in wildlife conservation issues, as they began to express their views in public media. Wildlife related coverage published in relevant journals around the turn of the twentieth century shows the emergence of conservation thinking in these groups. The most profound effort was put in protection of 'small birds'; this happened due to not only their usefulness in farming but also their sheer aesthetic value. The data further showed that the dichotomising of wildlife into 'useful' and 'pest' in the contemporary law texts was not fully consistent with the public opinion at the time. During the 1890s, all examined groups emphasised the importance of protecting certain rodent-eating raptors, but this view did not take any shape in the law reform of 1898. The emerging conservation-mindedness of these groups did not, however, apply to the most 'harmful' pests; the attitudes of, not only hunters, but also average animal welfarists, naturalists or professional zoologists towards many species in the pest category were not yet particularly positive at the turn of the century.

AB  - The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is one of the major insect pests of mature Norway spruce forests. In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961-2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4-3.8 degrees C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63-81% of the years. The corresponding figures are 16-33% for Mid Sweden, and 1-6% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.

AB  - High expectations to harness agricultural soils as sinks for atmospheric carbon (C) necessitate methods for verifying changes in soil organic C (SOC) stocks and improving the accuracy of regional SOC stock estimates specific to various land-use and management types. In this study we used a sample set included in the Finnish national soil monitoring network (n = 125) to determine the SOC stock and its vertical distribution in Finnish agricultural mineral soils using fixed depth (FD) and equivalent soil mass (ESM) methods. Further, we explored the within-field variation in SOC stock and minimum sample size in the context of SOC sequestration. Boreal agricultural mineral soils were found to be rich in SOC. The average SOC stock ranged between 8.4 and 9.8 kg m(-2)in the top 30 cm depending on cropping system and soil type. Cultivation of perennial crops tended to enrich the C close to the soil surface in comparison to dominantly annual crops, which exhibited a less steep C gradient with depth. The commonly used van Bemmelen factor of 1.724 to convert results of loss on ignition to SOC was found to be appropriate for coarse-textured Finnish agricultural soils. However, the results showed that in clay-rich soils, it is critical to take into account the structural water bound in clay particles to avoid overestimation of the SOC content. The study also demonstrated that the minimum sample size required to detect the change of 0.1 kg C m(-2)at field level is typically several hundreds. Therefore empirical soil sampling is not at all cost-effective enough for verifying the changes in SOC stocks with regard to compensation of C sequestration for farmers. Thus, alternative verification methods, such as SOC modelling in combination with field-level data collected, for example, using remote sensing should be developed further. Highlights
   Boreal agricultural mineral soils are rich in C Rotations where perennial crops dominated tended to enrich C in the soil surface Soil clay content should be taken into account when converting SOM to SOC The sample size required to verify SOC stock changes for C trading is extremely high

AB  - Forest management rarely considers protecting bats in Fennoscandian regions although all species rely on forest habitat at some point in their annual cycle. This issue is especially evident as wind parks have increasingly been developed inside Fennoscandian forests, against the advice of international bat conservation guidelines. In this study, we aimed to describe and explain bat community dynamics at a Norwegian wind park located in a boreal forest, especially to understand potential avoidance or attraction effects. The bat community was sampled acoustically and described using foraging guilds (short, medium, and long-range echolocators; SRE, MRE, LRE) as well as behavior (commuting, feeding and social calls). Sampling was undertaken at two locations per turbine: 1) the turbine pad and 2) a paired natural habitat at ground level, as well as from a meteorological tower. We used a recently developed method for camera trapping nocturnal flying insects synchronously with bat acoustic activity. Our results reveal trends in feeding and general bat activity across foraging guilds in relation to insect availability, habitat type, wind, temperature, and seasonality. We show how seasonal patterns in behavior across guilds were affected by habitat type, temperature, and wind. We found that SRE commuting and especially feeding activity was highest in natural habitats, whereas LRE overall activity at habitats more season dependent. We found that nocturnal insect availability was positively correlated with total bat feeding activity throughout the night. Our results provide evidence for both direct and indirect risks to bat communities by wind parks: SRE bat habitat is lost to wind energy infrastructure and LRE bat may have an increased risk of fatality. Our findings provide important insights on seasonal and spatial variability in bat activity, which can inform standardizing monitoring of bats acoustically in boreal forests, at wind parks, and in combination with non-invasive insect monitoring.

AB  - Northern Europe supports large soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and has been subjected to high frequency of land-use changes during the past decades. However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.

AB  - This paper deals with processes and outcomes of sustainable bioenergy development in Emilia Romagna. It draws on an on-going research project concerning inclusive innovation in forest-based bioenergy and biogas in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Italy. The goal is to explore how local governance impacts on inclusive innovation processes and triple bottom sustainability of bioenergy development in Emilia Romagna and, ultimately, to contribute to the debate on the bioeconomy. It thus compares the case of biogas and forest-based bioenergy production. The study adopts an analytical framework called Grounded Innovation (GRIP) and the local governance approach. The study uses qualitative methods and particularly semi-structured interviews and governance analysis. The key results show different outcomes on both inclusive innovation and triple bottom-line dimensions. Biogas has not fostered inclusiveness and triple bottom line sustainability benefits, contrary to forest-based bioenergy. The findings indicate that the minor role of local actors, particularly municipalities, in favour of industrial and national interests may jeopardise the sustainability of biobased industries. Besides, policies limited to financial incentives may lead to a land-acquisition rush, unforeseen local environmental effects and exacerbate conflicts.

AB  - In 2012 Sweden implemented a collaborative governance regime for managing moose (Alces aloes). This was guided by the awareness that decentralization and stakeholder participation can help to reduce conflicts, foster systematic learning, and handle complexity. However, previous research has highlighted that there are no blueprint approaches to the governance and management of natural resources. In this case, diverse multi-use landscapes, ever-changing ungulate populations, and other external stressors (e.g. climate change, wildlife diseases) can create challenges for collaborative institutions. Adaptive capacity is therefore needed as it allows a system and the actors involved to react successfully to social-ecological changes and to develop even in times of no imminent change or risk. Using Swedish moose management as an example of a multi-level governance system, this research assesses the critical determinants of adaptive capacity across levels. We developed and applied a psychometric approach to measure actors' perceived adaptive capacity on two levels in the management system. A web-based survey was sent to Moose Management Groups (n = 765, response rate = 81 %) and Moose Management Units (n = 1,380, response rate = 71 %). Using structural equation modelling, we assessed the relative importance of governance aspects, different types of social capital, as well as human and financial capital on actors' perceived adaptive capacity. Linking and bridging social capital in the system had significant impacts on both levels. Actors felt more prepared to handle future challenges in moose management when they perceived benefits through collaborations with levels below and expressed social trust in authorities and the management level above. Besides those similarities between the two levels, fairness was a more important determinant of actors' perceived adaptive capacity on the lower management level. These results can contribute to a future improvement of the collaborative governance setting by finessing strategic interventions on different levels. Furthermore, our results illustrate the importance of scale when assessing the adaptive capacity of a system.

AB  - Understanding where and why political change is happening in a country is a fundamental issue in political geography. While electoral choice is individual, it is influenced by various sociological, cultural, and geographical factors postulated to create 'cultural fields' influencing individual decision-making. Here, we test the cultural field hypothesis on Sweden, an important democracy of Europe long regarded as an example by other European countries, by studying the middle-long-term evolution of the spatial structure of political choice over the last three decades. In testing the cultural field hypothesis, an analysis of spatial correlations is combined with groupings of Swedish municipalities into larger communities reflecting the similarity of their voting profiles. We show that spatial correlations decay logarithmically, which is a sign of long-ranged interactions, and also demonstrate that Sweden can be divided into three or four large and stable politico-cultural communities. More precisely, a transition from three to four main politico-cultural communities is observed. The fourth community, which emerged in the early 2000s is of particular interest as it is characterized by a large vote-share for the Sweden Democrats, while almost all other parties underperform. Moreover, the Swedish electoral landscape seems to be increasingly fragmenting even when the voting profiles of the municipalities over the country are slowly converging.

AB  - In this work, we present a novel approach to explore future trajectories in urban drainage systems, emphasizing the adoption and implementation of sustainable 'nature-based' stormwater management strategies. The focus is on the development and long-term assessment of socio-technical pathways to create a multifunctional stormwater system at the city scale. The innovation is to identify and represent the socio-technical pathways by means of adoption curves for such transition processes. We combine urban planning policies and state-of-the-art urban engineering approaches with societal aspects and analyze them with traditional biophysical models (hydrologic-hydraulic sewer modeling). In doing so, different pathways from a current to a future system state are investigated under a variety of political, population and climate scenarios. Results allow for strategy screening by addressing the spatial and temporal implementation of decentralized stormwater control measures, to enable a successful transition to a sustainable future city. The model is applied to an ongoing transition of Kiruna, a city in Sweden, considering 36 different future trajectories over a transition period of 23 years. Results show that the trajectory of raingarden implementation under a sustainability policy can alleviate the adverse effects of urbanization (growth scenario). While this trajectory resulted in, for example, nearly the same sewer surcharge performance as that characterized by declining urbanization (stagnation) and a business-as-usual policy (with expected raingarden uptake rates approximately one-third lower), significantly better ecological performances (e.g. runoff treatment ratios up to 50%) are achieved.

AB  - Forests are important for the transition to a bioeconomy. With 60% of Europe's forest area owned and managed by small-scale owners, these owners' management behaviour is key. Identifying commonalities and differences between owners in different EU countries promotes effective implementation of EU strategies for a sustainable transition to a wood-based bioeconomy. This study examines the value orientations and management behaviour of private small-scale forest owners in five EU countries. Based on a questionnaire survey in Austria, Finland, Germany, Slovenia, and Sweden (n = 2524), we analysed these owners' values, and how various management activities are perceived in relation to management strategies. Respondents rated the importance of economic, environmental, and social values regarding their forest holdings, and were divided into groups based on their value orientation. Overall, the largest value group was 'All values very important'; more so in Austria, Finland, and Germany than in Slovenia and Sweden. In Finland and Sweden the proportion of respondents in the 'Eco-nomic and environmental values' value group was low. This suggets that small-scale forest owners in these countries rarely consider economics and the environment together. Forest management activities were applied to varying degrees in the five countries. However, respondents in all countries who considered all values to be very important were the most active in all management activities compared to those who considered all values to be somewhat important. Our analysis highlighted the importance of context, showing that the propensity to use a particular activity was explained to a lesser extent by owner characteristics and value orientation and, in the case of most activities, more strongly by country. The way objectives of policies and management strategies are communicated may need to be adapted to the specific conditions of each country.

TI  - Sustainability through good advice? Assessing the governance of Swedish forest biodiversity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA  - English
KW  - POLICY INSTRUMENTS
AB  - This article assesses the possibility of implementing biodiversity policies using voluntary, informative policy instruments. The case is the Swedish forest sector, a policy area where vital national economic interests as well as important ecological values are at stake. The results show that informative policy instruments affect the behaviour of forest owners by providing advice and raising awareness but do not change underlying values and preferences. Sustainability through good advice is an important practice with limited effects, at least in the short run. Private regulations (certifications) have a relatively powerful influence on forest owners and complement the public informative policy instruments, implying that the forest sector can be depicted as private governance with government.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the sectors of food tourism in Finland by using Maslow's hierarchy of needs in the classification.
   Design/methodology/approach - Previous research on food tourism concentrates on the role of food as an attraction, as a cultural phenomenon, and as an experience. Moreover, food from productional and motivational viewpoints is reviewed briefly. The empirical data consists both of the secondary data and an interview.
   Findings - The findings introduce five sectors of food tourism where the needs and motivations are linked with Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
   Practical implications - The practical implications are that the food tourism promoters could emphasize the needs and motivations when marketing food tourism services.
   Originality/value - Sectors of food tourism in Finland classified by the hierarchy of needs are presented, providing practical implications for food tourism promoters and thus offering motivations for food tourism.

AB  - Livestock depredation is an important factor that contributes to low public acceptance of large carnivores, and it is often used as an incentive to reduce large carnivore populations. In central Sweden, brown bears Ursus arctos coexist with a traditional cattle husbandry system that allows daytime free-ranging of dairy cattle. Despite a growing brown bear population, depredation on cattle remained stable during the last decade and is among the lowest rates reported worldwide. Nevertheless, major stakeholders argue for a substantial reduction in brown bear numbers, among other reasons, to safeguard the traditional husbandry system. Based on satellite tracking data, we assessed and correlated the resource selection of nine brown bears that were sympatric with six daytime free-ranging cattle herds during the free-ranging season (i.e. June-August) in 2008. We found a significant and negative relationship between resource selection of brown bears and free-ranging cattle during the study period, mainly because of inverse relationships between the species towards vegetation density and human-related infrastructure, such as forest roads, buildings and settlements. We predict that the probability of an encounter between these species, given that there is no directed predation, is highest in dense vegetation patches close to the human habitation-related variables. Because of the low reported depredation rates and the apparent habitat segregation between the species, our results provide no support for the argument to reduce brown bear numbers to safeguard the traditional cattle herding system.

AB  - This article explores the changing construction of the future in Swedish forestry since 1850. The framework is based on three concepts: (1) knowability, addressing changing views of knowledge; (2) governability, addressing changing views of the ability to steer the future; and (3) temporality, referring to varying ways of relating to time. The results reveal that until the 1980s, trust in science-based forestry triggered other knowledge-based activities, such as education, surveys, and field trials. The future was seen as predictable and forecasts were expected to support increased forest production. In the 1970s, the environmental debate about the forest incorporated a pluralistic futures agenda. High-production forestry using intensive management methods was questioned. Futures studies shifted focus from predictions to scenarios, highlighting a less predictable future open to human agency. Paradoxically, with increased knowledge of forest ecology and forest markets with improved modeling techniques, the future horizon shifted to one of risks and uncertainties.

AB  - This article looks at a project involving nine internationally acclaimed street artists who agreed to make murals in Oslo, following the 22 July 2011 attacks. Resting on the art project's aims ('to promote universal human rights and to counter the intolerance and xenophobia that can give rise to violence and justify terrorism') and the art community's reaction, the article argues that street art's visibility and agency offer alternative ways of thinking about, and approaching, international relations (IR). The article examines the streets as the space where artists express and engage the 'everyday'; and as the medium that allows artists to bring art to the public (as opposed to galleries or exhibitions the public chooses to visit). We argue that the incorporation of street art's spatiality and aesthetics into 'everyday IR' supports more critical frameworks that (a) expose the exceptional logic(s) of illiberal governance; (b) enable the visibility of marginalised and/or dissenting voices in society; and (c) explore experimental, eclectic and creative approaches of doing/thinking everyday security, community and peace.

AB  - Wildlife damage to human property threatens human-wildlife coexistence. Conflicts arising from wildlife damage in intensively managed landscapes often undermine conservation efforts, making damage mitigation and compensation of special concern for wildlife conservation. However, the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of damage and claims at large scales are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the patterns of damage caused by brown bears Ursus arctos and its ecological and socio-economic correlates at a continental scale. We compiled information about compensation schemes across 26 countries in Europe in 2005-2012 and analysed the variation in the number of compensated claims in relation to (i) bear abundance, (ii) forest availability, (iii) human land use, (iv) management practices and (v) indicators of economic wealth. Most European countries have a posteriori compensation schemes based on damage verification, which, in many cases, have operated for more than 30years. On average, over 3200 claims of bear damage were compensated annually in Europe. The majority of claims were for damage to livestock (59%), distributed throughout the bear range, followed by damage to apiaries (21%) and agriculture (17%), mainly in Mediterranean and eastern European countries. The mean number of compensated claims per bear and year ranged from 01 in Estonia to 85 in Norway. This variation was not only due to the differences in compensation schemes; damage claims were less numerous in areas with supplementary feeding and with a high proportion of agricultural land. However, observed variation in compensated damage was not related to bear abundance.Synthesis and applications. Compensation schemes, management practices and human land use influence the number of claims for brown bear damage, while bear abundance does not. Policies that ignore this complexity and focus on a single factor, such as bear population size, may not be effective in reducing claims. To be effective, policies should be based on integrative schemes that prioritize damage prevention and make it a condition of payment of compensation that preventive measures are applied. Such integrative schemes should focus mitigation efforts in areas or populations where damage claims are more likely to occur. Similar studies using different species and continents might further improve our understanding of conflicts arising from wildlife damage.

AB  - The deep-water coral Lophelia pertusa is a common reef-building scleractinian coral, or stony coral, occurring in mid to deep waters around the world. The reefs they form are regarded as hot spots for biodiversity and carbon cycling, and play a key role in benthic ecosystems in Norwegian waters. The cold-water reefs are however under increasing anthropogenic pressure due to human activities and a changing environment. Development of methods that enable time- and cost-effective monitoring of these reefs is therefore important. We propose using synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) on-board autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as a means to detect the presence of assemblages of corals. Automated segmentation of areas with coral is presented using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

AB  - The expansion of spruce-dominated forestry in Southern Sweden during the twentieth century has led to a considerable amount of oak (Quercus robur L.) woodlands being converted into stands dominated by planted spruce. The thinning of spruces around oak trees is currently done in Sweden to improve local diversity of insects, oak growing conditions and eventually decrease their mortality. To evaluate the effect of these treatments, we dendrochronologically studied growth of old (100-200 years old) oaks subjected to thinning of different intensity at nine locations in southern Sweden, and compared them to oaks located in nearby pastures. The overall pattern suggests that commonly adopted thinning intensities do not significantly affect oak growth. Oak growth was positively related to oak age and negatively to the amount of dead oak crown. Analyses of correlations between oak growth and summer drought conditions, as reflected by location-specific chronologies of the Monthly Drought Code (MDC), indicated that older trees exhibited generally negative correlations, whereas the correlation remained generally positive for the younger trees, both inside and outside forest stands. We propose that removal of spruces should be primarily done around older and healthier-looking trees.

AB  - The Finnish metal mining industry and mineral exploration have experienced rapid growth in recent years. The new activity has mainly focused on gold, and base, ferrous and platinum-group metals. The rapid growth has raised both hopes concerning the economic benefits and fears of environmental degradation, and has aroused local and national conflicts between differing viewpoints. In this paper, we assess the possible future development of the metal mining industry in Finland by constructing three scenarios presenting possible developments of the industry in economic and environmental terms. These are: 1) the best-estimate scenario, 2) the base-level scenario and 3) the maximum scenario. The best-estimate and maximum scenarios show continuous growth in the industry in the coming years if the profitability outlook of mining projects and prospects remains positive. Growth is indicated for both economic and environmental factors, especially in the value-added, waste mineral generation and indirect CO2-eq emissions. In the base-level scenario, there is a small growth observed during 2010-2020 but otherwise the indicators in this scenario show a declining trend. The metal mining industry appears to have a good potential to provide benefits in Finland, especially in the economically regressive northern and eastern areas. However, sufficient management of the economic and environmental impacts as well as successful corporate-stakeholder responsibility strategy is needed to maintain the industry's social license to operate.

AB  - Knowledge of space use is central to understand animals' role in ecosystems. The raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides is considered as one of the most influential alien mesopredator species in Europe, having the potential to cause loss of local biodiversity and act as a vector for zoonotic diseases. We collared 12 animals to study their home range and habitat use in two areas with different management regimes in Estonia: in a protected natural area and in an intensively managed area. From May to October raccoon dogs inhabiting the natural area had considerably smaller home ranges compared to the managed area, 193.3ha +/- 37.3SD and 391.9ha +/- 292.9SD, respectively. This result contradicts somewhat earlier findings in other European raccoon dog populations, where the home range sizes in natural areas in summer and autumn period have usually been larger compared to managed areas. In both study areas raccoon dogs preferred watersides, where amphibians and other semiaquatic prey are abundant, to other habitats available in their home ranges. We also studied movements of a raccoon dog pair in the managed study area in winter period. Due to mild weather conditions during the study period, raccoon dogs changed their resting sites quite often, covering a relatively large 599 ha area from November 2012 to January 2013, indicating the absence of usual winter lethargy during the mild winters.

AB  - Sustainable growth is a solution to reduce the negative effects of transport systems functioning in cities. It deals mainly with analysing the reasons for excessive exploitation and deterioration of the environment and specifying a strategy for limiting the process in the following areas: ecological, economic, social and cultural. The most effective activities in a sustainable urban transport policy combine all the aspects while minimising the costs connected with meeting the expected goals. Stakeholders' engagement is essential for the effectiveness of sustainable urban mobility plans. This paper proposes a tool for assessing the level of maturity of the engagement of urban freight transport stakeholders, comparing cities in Brazil, Poland and Norway. We proposed the minimum requirements of stakeholders' engagement and levels of maturity based on the literature. A comparative analyse was performed. The results indicate that Brazilian cities represent a low level of maturity, Polish cities represent intermediary level, and Norway cities, mainly Oslo, represent the more advanced level of maturity in the stakeholder's engagement. The results also indicated that the cities with sustainable urban mobility plans represent the highest level of maturity in the stakeholder's engagement.

AB  - Agricultural soil erosion has negative effects on surface water quality and aquatic ecosystems. A major imped-iment to agricultural erosion management in Finland has been the lack of high-resolution country-scale data on the spatial distribution of erosion. As a result, erosion mitigation measures have been targeted with limited information. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the widely used RUSLE model against measurements from experimental fields, used the model to produce a two-metre resolution crop and management independent erosion estimate for all agricultural lands of Finland, and analysed erosion over different spatial scales. RUSLE showed skill (R2 = 0.76, NSE = 0.72) in estimating the observed erosion at experimental fields (55-2100 kg ha- 1 yr- 1) but with large errors (mean:-134 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, 90% range:-711 and 218 kg ha- 1 yr- 1). The evaluation, however, suggests that RUSLE performs similarly in Finland as elsewhere. The analysis of the developed country -scale data, in turn, revealed high erosion regions, and it showed how erosion varies between sub-catchment and between and within field parcels. For example, high-erosion areas concentrated in the proximity of water bodies were identified at the sub-catchment and within-field parcel scales. Altogether, the results demonstrate the predictive skill of RUSLE in high-latitude conditions, fill the earlier data gap in country-scale erosion, provide information for targeting erosion mitigation measures, and considerably improve the understanding of the spatial distribution of erosion in Finland.

AB  - Visualisations of land-use projects have become an important part of the planning process. Using a survey of heritage professionals' attitudes towards visualisations as a starting point, this article addresses tensions between the expressed usefulness of visualisations and critical attitudes towards the lack of objectivity' of visual representation and the risk of manipulation for strategic purposes. Moving from the survey, the article discusses how visual representations of development proposals became part of a Norwegian public dispute over the expansion of a shopping centre in a historic town. Furthermore, our aim is to introduce a social semiotic approach for analysing visualisations at historic sites. Finally, we discuss some theoretical implications of negotiating visualisations, with emphasis on the recent debate about representational and non-representational theories in heritage studies.

AB  - In early design phases, architects, landscape architects and urban planners are key actors whose decisions determine the environmental impact of planning and building projects. Environmental and sustainability assessment tools for buildings and neighbourhoods have been developed to promote sustainable building, but their usage has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated self-reported knowledge and usage of such tools among competitors and jury group from 10 European countries involved in the international architectural competition A New City Centre for Kiruna' in Sweden. The questionnaire revealed that 13% used environmental assessment tools or management systems in the competition, although 47% had used them previously. Tool users reported greater knowledge of how to handle environmental impacts than non-users. However, the self-rated experience of handling various environmental impacts, in the competition and in general, was low for both groups. Nevertheless, the self-rated importance of environmental impacts was high among all participants. Based on this study, it is concluded that environmental assessment tools, issues and goals can be better integrated into the processes of early design in planning and building projects, and in architectural competitions. Furthermore, to limit environmental impacts in building and planning projects, professionals need to be educated about environmental strategies and solutions.

AB  - In Europe, Natura 2000 sites should protect threatened target species and networks of habitats. The management of Natura 2000 grasslands is often financed by subsidized grazing as part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We studied the extent of CAP grazing for Natura 2000 management and how this affects a butterfly target species (the marsh fritillary) and floral resources. Based on extensive capture-mark-release studies from 2 years in >550 ha grid cells in a 225 km(2) landscape in Sweden that includes 15 Natura 2000 sites, we compared marsh fritillary occurrence probabilities and population densities in ungrazed and CAP-grazed habitats. Moreover, we analyzed how nectar resources and orchids were affected by CAP grazing based on plants records from 2347 sample plots. We estimated the proportion of butterfly habitats that were CAP-grazed within and outside Natura 2000 sites. In total, 10 453 and 4417 butterflies were marked in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The grid cell occurrence probability was 1.8 times higher and the population density was 2.3 times higher in ungrazed compared with CAP-grazed habitats in 2017, and the corresponding numbers for 2019 were 10 and 5.3 times higher, respectively. The number of flowering plants were on average 6.9 times higher and the density of orchids was 12.3 times higher in ungrazed habitats. Roughly, 30% (130 ha) of the marsh fritillary habitat was CAP grazed, and 97% of this grazing occurred within protected areas, of which 111 ha was situated within Natura 2000 area where the marsh fritillary is the target species. Alarmingly, we show that intense yearly CAP grazing, which is the dominant management strategy in all Natura 2000 sites, has devastating consequences for the target species and other aspects of biodiversity. Less intense management, which would benefit biodiversity, requires changes in the CAP, to allow more flexible payments for habitat management objectives and conservation of target species.

AB  - Mainstreaming adaptation to climate change in forest-relevant policy can be as a "most difficult" case, relevant for asking the question to extent to which adaptation can at all be mainstreamed in complex multi-level governance systems. This study examines the case of to what extent EU and national (exemplified by Swedish) legal and policy frameworks are able to integrate with each other in ways that may support climate change adaptation in forests. To move as close to the real life situation of mainstreaming challenges as possible, the study focuses on not only one area of mainstreaming or integration, but on the three broad policy areas: (a) adaptation per se; (b) forest biodiversity and habitat protection with respect to invasive species; and (c) water protection in relation to forest use. The study concludes that conflicts between international legal principles such as precaution and free trade, as well as distribution of competences at EU and national level, results in a great discrepancy in terms of opportunities for a nation to effectively act independently as well as for effectively integrating adaptation aims in the connected EU-national systems.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess how to locate logging operations in the scenically most appropriate way. A second objective was to find out whether the visual design principles adopted elsewhere are applicable in Finland. Different felling alternatives were created partly on the basis of landscape-architectural principles, and partly on the basis of actual felling methods. The options were illustrated as slides produced by computer software. A total of 190 respondents evaluated the alternatives shown in 23 slides. Forest scenes without any notable logging operations were preferred to Those with the felling area visible. Conservation of hill silhouettes was important, regardless of whether the skyline was uniform or ragged. Seed trees improved the scenic appearance of felling sites, but residual solitary trees did not significantly enhance the visual quality of the scene. Summit forests were aesthetically most vulnerable to fellings, whereas lake shorelines and hillsides were more tolerant. A forest strip along shorelines improved the visual quality of felling sites. Irregular shapes were preferred to geometrical ones, as were horizontal shapes to vertical ones. Forestry personnel gave higher ranks than local residents and tourists to most of the logging options, while the respondents' preferences concerning untouched forests did nor differ: Forestry experts also made more distinctions among the alternative options than the other groups. The results obtained would suggest that the visual design principles of logging are, to some extent, related to specific cultural contexts and natural conditions. In addition, principles adopted from landscape architecture are not always consistent with the public's preferences. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Aim The forest steppe of the Transylvanian Plain is a landscape of exceptionally diverse steppe-like and semi-natural grasslands. Is this vegetation a remnant of a once continuous temperate forest extensively cleared by humans, or has the area, since the last glacial, always been a forest steppe? Understanding the processes that drive temperate grassland formation is important because effective management of this biome is critical to the conservation of the European cultural landscape.
   Location Lake Stiucii, north-western Romania, central-eastern Europe.
   Methods We analysed multi-proxy variables (pollen, coprophilous fungi, plant macroremains, macrocharcoal) from a 55,000year discontinuous sequence (c. 55,000-35,000; 13,000-0cal. yr bp), integrating models of pollen-based vegetation cover, biome reconstruction, global atmospheric simulations and archaeological records.
   Results Needleleaf woodland occurred during glacial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, but contracted at the end of this period. Forest coverage of c. 55% (early Holocene) and 65% (mid-Holocene) prevailed through the Holocene, but Bronze Age humans extensively cleared forests after 3700cal. yr bp. Forest coverage was most widespread between 8600 and 3700cal. yr bp, whereas grasses, steppe and xerothermic forbs were most extensive between 11,700 and 8600cal. yr bp and during the last 3700cal. yr bp. Cerealia pollen indicate the presence of arable agriculture by c. 7000cal. yr bp.
   Main conclusions We have provided the first unequivocal evidence for needleleaf woodland during glacial MIS 3 in this region. Extensive forests prevailed prior to 3700cal. yr bp, challenging the hypothesis that the Transylvanian lowlands were never wooded following the last glaciation. However, these forests were never fully closed either, reflecting dry growing season conditions, recurrent fires and anthropogenic impacts, which have favoured grassland persistence throughout the Holocene. The longevity of natural and semi-natural grasslands in the region may explain their current exceptional biodiversity. This longer-term perspective implies that future climatic warming and associated fire will maintain these grasslands.

AB  - Coregonids constitute one of the most diverse fish families in the northern freshwater systems and several species are highly endangered mainly due to anthropogenic pressure. Cost effective and powerful polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rnicrosatellite multiplex assays were established for genetic studies of the population structure, hybridization and conservation status of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) and vendace (C. albula (L.)). An assay containing four PCR multiplexes for co-amplification of 9, 5, 3, and 4 loci was developed for C. lavaretus. Cross-species amplification and rearrangement of the same loci resulted in an assay containing three multiplex reactions of 6, 3, and 4 loci for C. albula. Highly significant pair-wise F-ST - estimates were obtained between C. albula from L. Vaggatem (Norway) and L. Palojarvi (Finland) (F-ST = 0.301, p < 0.001), between C. lavaretus from L. Skrukkebukta (Norway) and L. Stuorajavri (Norway) (F-ST = 0.161, p < 0.001), and between morphpairs occurring in the two latter lakes (F-ST = 0.0135-0.043, p < 0.001). The multiplex assays provided a 100% correct assignment success for discriminating C. lavaretus and C. albula and hence provide a powerful diagnostic tool for the future management of these species.

AB  - This study aims to elaborate of the concept of ethnographic village based on the Karelian-Finnish epic Kalevala. Creating such a village will foster academic research on the common ethnic background of Karelians and Finns, the culture and literary language developed due to this epic and will become a key point for its further use as a tourist center in business projection. Relevant research Literature and academic conference papers were used to achieve the above objective. To confirm that the right choice was made of the epic as the foundation of the future thematic entity and to investigate the target audience and the touristic relevance of the project among fifty-four travel agency managing directors, the authors adopted the peer reviewing method worked out by the "Yuminkeko" - Foundation, - a cultural center located in the town of Kuhmo, Finland, whose tasks include preserving Kalevala-related culture, promoting cultural exchanges between Karelia and Finland and carrying out international projects. The concept presented in present study won an investment proposal competition as part of the Russia- EU Cross-border Cooperation Program. Currently, an ethnic village business plan is being developed with a view of attracting investment.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the recent history of forest management on the state and structure of forests. Comparisons were made between test areas in the south-eastern part of North Karelia, Finland, and the western part of the Republic of Karelia, Russian Federation. The test areas are located in the same climatic region, but their history of forest management has been considerably different during the past 50 years. They therefore also provide possibilities for wider international observations.
   The total biodiversity of a large forest area consists of the existence and area distribution of the forest succession stages. Within these stages the stand structure reflects the processes of the small natural vegetation succession cycle of boreal coniferous forests. Considering the factors that maintain potential forest biodiversity, it is clearly seen that the forests in the Republic of Karelia are in a more natural state than those of North Karelia. However, considering the natural fire ecology of the region, both test areas have a paucity of old forests. When examining the stand characteristics reflecting the small succession cycle within habitats, the forests in the Republic of Karelia have more of the crucial factors typical of species classified as threatened in Finland.
   If mimicking the natural dynamics of boreal coniferous forests is taken as a goal of forest management, the desired habitat diversity can be achieved only by maintaining all stages of the large vegetation succession cycle. Within the succession stages of young, middle-aged and mature stands, structural variation and variation of tree species composition should be increased. This can be achieved by means of forest management and forestry operations, but these policies, on the other hand, may decrease wood production.

AB  - The weed flora on 57 arable fields on 17 farms employing organic farming was recorded. With the ordination technique pCCA (partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis) the relative importance of some farming practices was evaluated (crop, preceding crop, +/- undersown ley, +/- weed harrowing, +/- weed hoeing, ploughing regime, +/- compost, +/- animal husbandry, rt biodynamic agriculture). The variables that explained most of the variation in the weed flora in fields (along with typical weed species) were the crops 'beans and peas' (analysed together; Centaurea cyanus),'ley as preceding crop' (Cerastium fontanum), 'weed hoeing',:fallowing in the preceding year' (Lamium spp.) and 'animal husbandry' (Sinapis arvensis). A number of species considered endangered, rare or decreasing in Sweden were recorded on these farms, suggesting that organic farming can contribute to maintaining biodiversity in an agricultural landscape. The weed flora was also compared with that of unsprayed control plots in herbicide trials. Ranking of weeds according to either frequency or a pCCA both showed clear differences, with organic fields having much more weeds. Species typical of organic farming were Centaurea cyanus and Vicia hirsuta. There was a tendency for weed species that dominate in conventional farming to be more nitrophilous than those species characteristic in organic farming.

AB  - We examined the Finnish biodiversity conservation pilot project, called Trading in Natural Values (TNV), using a simulated biodiversity auction model. We found, first, that the share of the most valuable old stands in the key ecological forest habitats was higher in the actual TNV program than in a simulated auction. Second, the actual bids in the TNV program were on average (sic)400-1,200 lower per ha than the bids generated by the auction model. These findings indicate the presence of strong conservation motives among the Finnish landowners. Third, because the number of stands with high biodiversity values is limited in the study area and conservation costs are high for these stands, increasing the size of the conservation budget enrolls more stands in the program but with lower biodiversity values.

AB  - Plant species composition and species number were studied in two types of field margins: 31 arable field margins and 33 road verges. Both field margin types were adjacent to intensively managed grass or cereal fields. Effects of eight variables on field margin vegetation were studied. Despite having many plant species in common, composition and species number differed between the two field margin types, due to different ecological conditions and margin management. Arable field margins were composed of tall and/or nutrient demanding ubiquitous species and were characterised by species of later successional stages than those of road verges. The vegetation of road verges was lower and species numbers were higher than in arable field margins. The road verges contained several semi-natural meadow species that are declining in abundance. A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded variables showed that plant species composition was significantly affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent to fields with mainly cereal crops. In order to preserve botanical diversity in this agricultural landscape, the maintenance of regularly mown road verges should be prioritized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - In Norway, the landowners' income from forestry and farming has decreased, mainly due to changes in international trade and trade conventions, and they are looking for new sources of income. In Norway, as opposed to Canada and USA, the landowner holds the right to hunt on their own land, and the meat from the hunt is sold on the free market. Still, a large, but unknown portion of the hunting permits are used in a closed market of landowners, their friends and local people wherein the only economic value of hunting is free or cheap meat to hunter and landowner. With increasing moose populations and increasing potential income for the landowner, more hunting permits are sold on the open market, where the hunters pay for the meat and/or the hunting experience. The main economic costs are moose browsing on pine plantations and moose-vehicle collisions. Crop damage is an additional small cost. The socioeconomic estimates of benefits and costs vary considerably depending on the methods used. The two main estimation problems are the closed hunting market and damage to plantations, which first show economical losses after about 100 years. The estimates of total annual revenue range from US $70 to 90 M and the costs from US $23 to 80 M. When setting the economic carrying capacity for moose, the increased costs of forest damage and traffic accidents, and mitigating countermeasures, should be compared to the increase in income associated with one more moose added to the population. In Norway, the regional management units set regional goals, whereas the duty of national wildlife authorities is to ensure that national and international goals are met. To succeed in managing the moose population to an optimal economic carrying capacity, a broad cooperation between interest groups and detailed spatial economic and ecological knowledge will be needed. We predict that increased economic revenue will become an important objective for many moose regions.

AB  - For understanding new governance and its opportunities for supplementing government driven policy, networks are an important mechanism and unit of analysis. The theoretical bases for analysing policy networks, project networks, and operational networks overlap in a random fashion. This paper reviews and compares the theoretical approaches utilised in analysing networks and their perspectives on learning. Policy, project and operational networks are exemplified in the context of integrating biodiversity conservation into forest policy in Finland. Information flow and appreciation among network organisations are analysed with the aim of understanding how the formality and openness of information exchange shape learning mechanisms, and the capacity of the networks to adapt to the policy demand for biodiversity conservation. The policy, project and operational networks generate partly different mechanisms for learning. While project networks utilise both direct and open access to up-to-date research-based understanding of biodiversity conservation and bridge across sector-boundaries, policy networks are more strongly reliant on formal patterns of information exchange and communicate interests at a level distanced from practice. Operational networks on the other hand, have strong informal contacts but their biodiversity conservation learning relies on information flows through conduit-like closed links. Reliance on channels and allowing spill-overs can improve adaptation and explorative learning. Where information exchange is formally defined, informal ties can ease the tackling of emerging issues.

AB  - The Swedish wild boar (Sus scrofa) population has increased rapidly over the last decades, resulting in conflicts with human activities. Particularly, the increase has been challenging for agriculture as wild boar cause damage on crops and grasslands. To predict under what conditions to expect damage and where to prioritize management actions, basic knowledge about wild boar habitat and space use is needed. In this study, we used data from 99 wild boar equipped with GPS-collars, collected over a large temporal scale and throughout their distributional range in southern Sweden. We investigated wild boar home range size and habitat use across gradients of habitat availability and population density. Functional response in habitat use was assessed by estimating the use and availability of agricultural land on individual level and then, on population-level evaluating how use changed with changing availability. Finally, a potential response in habitat use was evaluated in relation to population density, i.e., the interaction between availability and population density. Home range size was negatively related to population density for both male and female wild boar. Wild boar used agricultural land more intensively with increasing population density and when other habitat types were less available. Our findings show that wild boar spatial behavior is highly context dependent and may vary considerably due to landscape characteristics and local conditions. Wild boars tend to overuse agricultural land at high densities which has strong implications for wildlife management. It is therefore important to consider local conditions when predicting space and habitat use by wild boar. Overall, this study provided a better understanding of the drivers of wild boar distribution and space use in agro-forested mosaic landscapes and how this knowledge can improve management practices.

AB  - There is an assumption in current landscape preference theory of universal consensus in human preferences for moderate to high openness in a natural landscape. This premise is largely based on empirical studies of urban Western populations. Here we examine for the first time landscape preference across a number of geographically, ecologically and culturally diverse indigenous populations. Included in the study were two urban Western samples of university students (from southern Sweden) and five non-Western, indigenous and primarily rural communities: Jahai (Malay Peninsula), Lokono (Suriname), Makalero (Timor), Makasae (Timor), and Wayuu (Colombia). Preference judgements were obtained using pairwise forced choice assessments of digital visualizations of a natural landscape varied systematically on three different levels of topography and vegetation density. The results show differences between the Western and non-Western samples, with interaction effects between topography and vegetation being present for the two Swedish student samples but not for the other five samples. The theoretical claim of human preferences for half-open landscapes was only significantly confirmed for the student sample comprising landscape architects. The five non Western indigenous groups all preferred the highest level of vegetation density. Results show there are internal similarities between the two Western samples on the one hand, and between the five non-Western samples on the other. To some extent this supports the idea of consensus in preference, not universally but within those categories respectively.

AB  - A fine-scale numerical model for road surface parameters prediction (BJ-ROME) is developed based on the Common Land Model. The model is validated using in situ observation data measured by the ROSA road weather stations of Vaisala Company, Finland. BJ-ROME not only takes into account road surface factors, such as imperviousness, relatively low albedo, high heat capacity, and high heat conductivity, but also considers the influence of urban anthropogenic heat, impervious surface evaporation, and urban land-use/land-cover changes. The forecast time span and the update interval of BJ-ROME in vocational operation are 24 and 3 h, respectively. The validation results indicate that BJ-ROME can successfully simulate the diurnal variation of road surface temperature both under clear-sky and rainfall conditions. BJ-ROME can simulate road water and snow depth well if the artificial removing was considered. Road surface energy balance in rainy days is quite different from that in clear-sky conditions. Road evaporation could not be neglected in road surface water cycle research. The results of sensitivity analysis show solar radiation correction coefficient, asphalt depth, and asphalt heat conductivity are important parameters in road interface temperatures simulation. The prediction results could be used as a reference of maintenance decision support system to mitigate the traffic jam and urban water logging especially in large cities.

AB  - European landscapes have been shaped over the centuries by processes related to human land use, which are reflected in regionally distinct landscape patterns Since landscape pattern has been linked to biodiversity and other ecological Values of the landscapes. this paper explores landscape pattern as a tool for ecological sustainability assessments at the regional (Austrian Cultural Landscapes), national (Austria) and European (European Union + Norway, Switzerland) level with focus oil agricultural landscapes A set of landscape metrics served as a basis to assess naturalness and geometrisation of Austrian and European landscapes as a proxy for their sustainability To achieve an accurate spatially explicit assessment, we applied a spatial reference framework consisting in units that are homogeneous in biophysical and socio-economic contexts, adapted the regional approach for its application at European level, and developed relative sustainability thresholds for the landscape metrics The analyses revealed that several landscape metrics, particularly the "Number of Shape Characterising Points" showed a high correlation with the degree of naturalness The sustainability map of Austria based on ail ordinal regression model revealed well-known problem regions of ecological sustainability At [lie European level, the relative deviation from the average pattern showed clearly the simplification processes in the landscapes. However. a better spatial resolution of land cover data would add to the refinement of pattern analysis in regions and therefore the assessment of sustainability. We recommend the combination of information of different scales for the formulation and implementation of sustainability policies (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Black shales are sedimentary rocks containing > 0.5% of organic carbon. They host polymetallic deposits which have been mined for Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, P, Mo, V, U, Au and PGE (platinum group elements). Even sub-economic occurrences provide potential risk of acid rock drainage when exposed to oxic surface environment. The natural acid neutralisation potential varies depending on the adjacent rock units, especially on the presence of calcareous rocks. The chemical and mineralogical composition of black shale is reflected in the quality of the surface waters and groundwater. Cu, Ni, Pb, U and Zn are recognised as major pollutants though the environmental impact is characteristically polymetallic just like the black shale occurrences. Hence, the environmental impacts have to be evaluated in each occurrence.
   The Proterozoic Ni-Zn-Cu-Co deposit at Talvivaara, Finland, is reviewed in more detail as an example of a large, low-grade deposit that is currently exploited with open pit mining and a bioleaching process, together with the Proterozoic Central African Copperbelt, the Cambrian U-Mo deposits in Sweden, the Cambrian Ni-Mo-PGE deposits in China and the Cambrian-Ordovician U deposits in South-Korea, the Devonian Ni-Zn-PGE occurrences in Yukon, Canada, and Kentucky, USA, and the Permian Cu-Ag deposits in Poland and Germany. The mineralised horizons may be merely few centimetres thick like in Yukon or hundreds of metres thick like at Talvivaara. Both natural and anthropogenic environmental impacts of black shales are reviewed world-wide, and based on the overview of the state-of-the-art an integrated research approach is suggested for the comprehensive assessment of the risk.
   Black shales are natural sources of soil and water contamination. At Talvivaara, the geochemical background includes higher than average concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn and Mn in glacial till, peat, surface waters and groundwater as well as in stream and lake sediments. Bioaccumulation by plants has been reported in China and Korea. Even endemic diseases have been proposed to be linked with the contamination derived from the weathering and leaching of harmful elements from black shale. Anthropogenic actions exposing the black shale bedrock and associated soils to oxic conditions further intensifies acid rock drainage.
   Regional or nation-wide mapping of the black shales is recommended to detect potential risk areas. Finland has recently completed the country-wide mapping program of black shales with airborne geophysics integrated with geological, petrophysical and geochemical studies. The black shale database is actively used in regional planning and by environmental authorities, research institutes and consulting companies. In the case of the historical black shale mining areas like in the Kupferschiefer in Germany, restoration measures have been applied to prevent further acid mine drainage. In active and future mining projects, a comprehensive environmental impact assessment with effective monitoring programmes and closure plans play a crucial role in the prevention of acid mine drainage from the black shale -associated deposits.

AB  - The institutional capacity of local authorities to integrate climate change mitigation aspects into spatial planning is of vital importance. This paper sets out to investigate this capacity in the county of Stockholm, Sweden, by surveying 26 municipalities and analysing two case study municipalities through participation in workshops and interviews. The study shows the need both for a local energy and climate policy domain that can be integrated into spatial planning as well as dedicated personnel to maintain this policy, thereby securing knowledge resources within the organisation. Additionally, the importance of relations to and repertoires for interacting with politicians is highlighted. Lastly, the study demonstrates the complementary added value of a regional-local network administered by the County Administrative Board, spreading learning examples and diffusing theoretical knowledge, as well as sub-regional, inter-municipal networks that enable the transfer of more practical knowledge and provide a platform for concrete action.

CP  - Human Role in Reindeer/Caribou Systems Workshop
AB  - Reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus) constitute a biological resource of vital importance to the physical and cultural survival of Arctic residents since time immemorial, Recent and possible future economic, social and ecological changes raise concern for sustainability of these resources and the well-being of those who depend on them. In February 1999 eighty scientists, reindeer/caribou users and resource managers gathered in Rovaniemi, Finland, for an interdisciplinary workshop to develop a circumpolar research plan that addressed the sustainability of human-reindeer/caribou systems. Small working groups addressed six themes: hunting systems, herding systems, rangeland/habitat protection, minimizing industrial impacts, maintaining the strength of indigenous cultures, and responding to global change. The resulting Research Plan calls for interdisciplinary comparative studies, advancement: of tools for assessing cumulative effects, implementation of regional and a circumpolar monitoring and assessment programmes, and cultural studies on the transmission of knowledge. Cross-cuttings directives for future research include:
   improving humans' ability to anticipate and respond to change;
   understanding better the dynamics of human-reindeer/caribou systems;
   developing research methods that are both more instructive and less intrusive;
   facilitating open communication among groups with interests in reindeer/caribou resources;
   organizing researchers into a strong, coordinated network;
   re-framing the conventional research paradigm to be more inclusive of differing cultural perspectives.
   Three follow-up initiatives are proposed: 1) development of a web-based resource on the human role in reindeer/caribou systems (www.rangifer.net); 2) establishment of a Profile of Herds database to support comparative research; and 3) convening of working groups to address specific problems identified by workshop participants.

AB  - Crisis management planning and response can be improved by regional governments and organisations learning from one another. Specifically, comparative learning may be a benefit when groups understand the perceived effectiveness of various regional approaches when responding to different types of hazards. This article presents findings from a comparative case study analysis of regional governance perspectives of crisis management for geopolitical events and natural hazards in the Sunshine Coast, Australia, and Gotland, Sweden. Data were collected and analysed using document analyses and semi-structured interviews with regional practitioners. It was found that regional crisis management is increasingly influenced by global processes that are affecting the scales and characteristics of crises. As a result, prospective regional governance must evolve to include more international perspectives in crisis management and account for activities and processes that take place beyond arbitrary political boundaries.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to compare, from an urban planning perspective, the choice between combined heat and power (CHP) and a ground-source heat pump (HP) as the energy systems of a new residential area in the light of the uncertainty related to the assessments. There has been a strong push globally for CHP due to its climate mitigation potential compared to separate production, and consequently it is often prioritized in planning without questioning. However, the uncertainties in assessing the emissions from CHP and alternative options in a certain planning situation make it very difficult to give robust decision guidelines. In addition, even the order of magnitude of the climate impact of a certain plan is actually difficult to assess robustly. With a case study of the new residential development of Harmalanranta in Tampere, Finland, we show how strongly the uncertainties related to (1) utilizing average or marginal electricity as the reference; (2) assigning emissions intensities for the production; and (3) allocating the emissions from CHP to heat and electricity affect the results and lead to varying decision guidelines. We also depict how a rather rarely utilized method in assigning the emissions from CHP is the most robust for planning support.

AB  - We studied the relations of aquatic macrophyte communities, ecological quality metrics and water quality to lake characteristics and to land use defined at multiple spatial scales (three lake marginal zones (LMZs) of contrasting width and the whole topographic catchment) in 110 boreal lakes in Finland using ordination and generalised additive modelling. Variation in macrophyte community composition of our lakes was related to water quality, land use, latitude and lake morphology. Relationships of macrophyte status metrics - the proportion of type-specific species (TT50), Percent Model Affinity (PMA) and Trophic Index (TI) - to land use were scale dependent. The proportion of agricultural and urban land use adjacent to the lake shoreline (LMZs of 300 m and 500 m) had a more significant effect on the metrics compared to land use at the catchment scale. The scale-related pattern in the effect of land use was not congruent among metrics and the metrics also showed different indications of deterioration. Lower sensitivity to the measured disturbance of the pressure sensitive metric TI compared to the other metrics (1150 and PMA) based on general type-specific species composition was presumably due to a lack of helophytes in the species pool used, and due to invariable indicator values across lake types. Moreover. TI varied more with hydromorphology related natural gradients than TT50 and PMA. This could be due to lack of habitat for eutrophication sensitive submerged indicator species in shallow lakes. Our study demonstrates that choosing the most influential catchment scale for the evaluation and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts on lacustrine biota, may be significant in conserving and restoring the ecological quality of freshwaters, as required by, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Safe System is a holistic way of managing traffic safety based on all components within that system including road environments, speed regimes, vehicle safety, and post-crash intervention. The ultimate goal is to achieve zero road death and serious injury. Safe System was pioneered in the Netherlands and Sweden in the 1990s and gradually began to influence traffic safety management in other countries, including the U.S. Our research shows that since the adoption of Safe System in the Netherlands and Sweden, the risk of fatality has decreased at a rate far outpacing that in the U.S. The improvements have been particularly impressive when it comes to pedestrians and bicyclists who now have fatality risks that are as low as that of people in cars. Our paper outlines details of the Dutch and Swedish approach to Safe System that is associated with their tremendous success in reducing traffic fatality. The synthesis suggests that to embrace the Safe System approach, we need a paradigm shift that puts safety and quality of life at the forefront of our thinking about transportation planning, design, and implementation. We argue that there is a need for a broader dissemination, understanding, and adoption of the underlying principles of Sustainable Safety, and recommend that universities improve engineering and planning education with more Sustainable Safety thinking. We also argue for greater coordination between federal, state, and municipal agencies, and a move away from victim blaming toward the achievable goal of zero road deaths through the adoption of Sustainable Safety approaches.

AB  - Climate change can affect the mining sector in various ways. Physical impacts can be a threat to mines and personnel, transport infrastructure and supply chains, while the low-carbon transition may entail transition risks stemming from e.g., the need to respond to mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as opportunities in the form of increased metal and mineral demand. However, there is little knowledge of how mining companies perceive, manage, and respond to risks related to climate change. To address this knowledge gap, we examined annual and sustainability reports from 2019 for active metal mines in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Through a structuring qualitative content analysis, we analysed the mining companies' self-reported experience of and expectations for climate change impacts and risks, as well as adaptation and management activities taken or planned. Our findings indicate that physical impacts of climate change are not perceived as a major risk. In contrast, mitigation activities and reactions to climate policies play an important role, at least for some of the companies. Hence, the mining sector would benefit from more stringent risk reporting regulations and distinctive guidelines, as well as more research on the direct and indirect climate change impacts.

AB  - Land Use Change (LUC), especially deforestation in tropical regions, significantly contributes to global anthro-pogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we address potential combined impacts of LUC and Climate Change (CC) on Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks in the Ethiopian highlands. The soil model Q was employed to predict SOC stocks for various combinations of LUC and CC scenarios until the year 2100. Four reference sce-narios (cropland, bushland, natural forest, and Eucalyptus plantations under contemporary climatic conditions) were evaluated against reported measurements of SOC stocks. We studied impacts of six common LUC scenarios, including deforestation and planting Eucalyptus, on SOC stocks under contemporary and future climates. To assess the impact of CC, effects of elevated temperature (mean annual temperature + 2.6 degrees C) together with three litterfall scenarios (no change in litterfall, a 5% reduction and 22% increase, designated CC0, CCd, and CCi, respectively) were considered to test potential vegetation responses to increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Most of the tested combinations of LUC and CC led to losses of SOC stocks. Losses were most severe, both relatively and absolutely, in the deforestation scenarios: up to 30% was lost if natural forest was converted to cropland and temperature increased (under the CC0 scenario). Gains in SOC stocks of 4-19% were modelled when sparse vegetation was converted to more dense vegetation like Eucalyptus plantation with sub-stantially increased litterfall (the CCi scenario). Elevated temperature accelerated decomposition rates, leading to circa 8% losses of SOC stocks.We conclude that effects of LUC and CC on SOC stocks are additive and changes in litterfall caused by LUC determine which has the largest impact. Hence, deforestation is the biggest threat to SOC stocks in the Ethiopian highlands, and stocks in sparse vegetation systems like cropland and bushland are more sensitive to CC0 than LUC. We recommend conservation of natural forests and longer rotation periods for Eucalyptus plantations to preserve SOC stocks.Finally, we suggest that use of the Q model is a viable option for national reporting changes in SOC stocks at Tier 3 within the LULUCF sector to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as it is widely applicable and robust, although it only requires input data on a few generally available variables.

AB  - To reduce the energy sector's CO2 emissions, sustainability transitions are essential but may have unexpected national security consequences. We investigate policymaking around energy transitions and national security, combining sociology with sustainability transitions thinking to analyse 73 policy documents issued between 2006 and 2023 in Estonia, Finland, and Norway and investigate how zero-carbon energy and security issues have co-evolved with, strengthened, or undermined one another by analysing the rhetoric in official national strategy documents. With an epistemic governance framework, we identify the discourses that contextualise, justify, and explain policymaking in the energy-security nexus. We find that sustainable energy transitions are strengthened by connections to national security when alternative energy niches have matured but undermined for the same reason when fossil fuels are viewed as more robust sources of security. We detect policy intervention points aiming to indicate how transitions are enabled. Estonia and Finland evince strategic directions to destabilise the regime while supporting niches, whereas Norway focuses on continued oil and gas production. Whereas all are in principle in favour of sustainability transitions, they define transitions differently: Estonia values national sovereignty, Finland preparedness and the economy, and Norway sustainable development and economic security tied to hydrocarbons.

AB  - Norway is the world's largest producer of farmed salmon. Aquaculture is the country's second largest export industry and thus vital for employment in coastal areas of Norway. The industry is dependent on public acceptance and good standing in local communities in order to gain access to new sites and to be able to sell its product. Public opinion (and assumptions about public opinion) on aquaculture may influence the industry's framework conditions and policy. Being located in coastal and rural areas, the industry must rely on the media to spread information to the public about the industry. Therefore, the media are an important source of information about farmed salmon, and the way the media present aquaculture issues has an impact on public opinion as well as authorities. This article examines how the aquaculture industry is portrayed in Norwegian newspapers and discusses how media topics and media framing may influence public opinion. The analysis shows that the most frequent topics covered in Norwegian newspapers are connected to the environment, aquaculture industry, and politics, where the concerns about the environment are dominant within the risk frame. The negative images portrayed by the media have a strong agenda-setting force and may skew public opinion to a narrow focus on environmental risks, influencing both the debate's content and the regulators' increased emphasis on environmental risks. This is strengthened further by the focus on sustainability, where the focus is solely on the dimension of environment, making other sustainability dimensions less prominent in the media coverage.

AB  - Logging exceeded growth and timber trees were sparse in Norwegian forests in the early 1900s. Still, the forest canopy was lush green and characterised by large tree-crowns. This situation was referred to as the "Green lie'' and was advocated by foresters throughout Scandinavia as an argument in favour of forestry practices based on clear-felling. Here we examine effects of past selective loggings on forest structure and composition in a spruce forest landscape using dendroecology and historical records. Our results show that forests that were selectively logged up to the early 1900s could be structurally heterogeneous with multi-layered canopies, varying degree of openness and continuous presence of old trees across different spatial scales. Because the past forests were not clear-felled, a diverse forest structure in terms of tree species composition and age and diameter distribution was maintained over time, which could enable forest-dwelling species to persist during the early phase following the loggings in the past. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in most modern managed forest landscapes in Scandinavia. A better understanding of the link between loggings in the past- and present-day forest structure and diversity will contribute to rewarding discussions on forestry methods for the future.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on marine habitats are a global problem, particularly in coastal areas. While boulder reefs in temperate waters hold high biomass and biodiversity, and may be unable to recover from anthropogenic stressors without restoration efforts, little is known about how to restore and conserve this important marine habitat. Limited knowledge is a serious impediment to projects aimed at restoring boulder reefs that have been degraded or removed by substrate extraction. In 2008, a boulder reef was restored in Kattegat, the transitional waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, using differently sized boulders. The restored reef covered approximately 27,600 m(2) seafloor and included 100,712 tons of boulders added at depths ranging between 4 and 11 m. This paper describes methodology and lessons learned during the restoration project. Before the restoration, geological and geotechnical surveys confirmed that the sea bed could support added boulders, and high resolution bathymetric surveys provided input for the design of the reef, particularly for numerical modelling of the hydrographic and sediment transport conditions. Numerical modelling was used to derive hydrographic design conditions for boulder placements and further, to ensure that the restored reef would not affect the sea bed morphology and hydrographic conditions at a local harbour and at a protected habitat, both situated in the vicinity of the restoration area. Data on the physical structure of the restored boulder reef, collected in 2009, demonstrated that cavernous structures and shallow reef areas were restored. Moreover, data collected in 2012 confirmed the stability of the restored reef. Finally, results highlighted the importance of stakeholder mapping at the outset, appropriate timing of stakeholder involvement and ongoing consideration of stakeholder perceptions. Charting strategy and introducing a checklist for marine restoration projects, this paper outlines important considerations and methodology needed to ensure that restoration of temperate reef structures meet the objectives, without having undesirable effects on existing hydrographic and morphological conditions, including nearby coastal areas and protected marine habitats.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on coastal areas have led to an increased degradation of marine environments globally. Eelgrass ecosystems are particularly susceptible to human induced stressors as they are sensitive to low light conditions and usually grow in shallow protected areas where pressure from coastal development is high. The extensive decline in coverage of eelgrass along the Swedish Northwest coast since the 1980s has largely been attributed to the effects of coastal eutrophication and overfishing. However, the impact on eelgrass from small-scale coastal development (docks and marinas) has never been investigated in this area. The aim of this study was to assess the local and large-scale effect of shading by docks and marinas on eelgrass habitats along the Swedish NW coast and to investigate the decision process behind small-scale exploitation to identify problems with the current legislation, which allows for continued exploitation of eelgrass. Through field assessments of eelgrass around docks and analysis of available data on eelgrass and dock distribution along the coast, the present study demonstrates that shading from docks reduced eelgrass coverage with on average 42-64% under and adjacent to the docks, and that floating docks affected larger areas and caused a much stronger reduction in eelgrass coverage (up to 100% loss) compared to docks elevated on poles (up to 70% reduction in coverage). The total eelgrass area negatively affected by docks and marinas along the NW coast was estimated to approximately 480 ha, an area corresponding to over 7% of the present areal coverage of eelgrass in the region. The analysis of decisions for dock construction showed that eelgrass was generally not assessed or considered in the decision process and that 69-88% of the applications were approved also in areas where eelgrass was present. Furthermore, marine protected areas only marginally reduced the approval of applications in eelgrass habitats. The continued small-scale development along the Swedish NW coast constitutes a significant threat to the already decimated coverage of eelgrass along the coast and changes in the management practices are needed in order to achieve both national and international goals on environmental status.

AB  - Questions Forest classifications are tools used in research, monitoring, and management. In Finland, the Cajanderian forest site type classification is based on the composition of understorey vegetation with the assumption that it reflects in a predictable way the site's productive value. In Russia, the Sukachevian forest classification is similarly based on understorey vegetation but also accounts for tree species, soil wetness, and paludification. Here we ask whether Cajander's and Sukachev's forest types are effectively the same in terms of species composition, site productivity, and biodiversity. Location Boreal forests on mineral soils in Finland and the Russian part of Fennoscandia. Methods We use vegetation and soil survey data to compare the Cajanderian and the Sukachevian systems in terms of the understorey community composition (that is supposed to define them), soil fertility and tree productivity (that they are expected to indicate), and biodiversity (that is of interest for conservation purposes). We create and employ class prediction models to divide Russian and Finnish sites into Cajander's and Sukachev's types, respectively, based on vegetation composition. We perform cross-comparisons between the two systems by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and statistical tests. Results Within both systems, the site types formed similar, meaningful gradients in terms of the studied variables. Certain site types from the two systems were largely overlapping in community composition and arranged similarly along the fertility gradient and may thus be considered comparable. Conclusions The Cajanderian and the Sukachevian systems were both developed in the European boreal zone but differ in terms of the exact rules by which site types are determined. Our results show that analogous types between the systems can be identified. These findings aid in endeavours of technology and information transfer between Finnish and Russian forests for the purposes of basic or applied ecological research and forest management.

AB  - It has been generally accepted that cultivation in northernmost Sweden was intrinsically associated with the migration of Nordic farmers into the area and that indigenous Sami societies followed purely hunter-gatherer or pastoralist subsistence strategies. In this paper, it is argued that the discursive connotations of cultivation have promoted a dichotomy between Sami and Swedish idioms that are still being reproduced among scholars, as well the general public. Recent palynological findings in pollen records challenge prevailing views on the time, course, and cultural context of the introduction of ( cereal) cultivation and call for a redefinition of traditional Sami subsistence, as well as for a decolonization of the cultivation concept.

AB  - In search of an appropriate institutional structure for successful environmental policy, many researchers focus on network governance. And while it provides the flexibility and adaptability needed for climate change initiatives, the paper argues that many networks collaborate too loosely to have the capacity to reach strategic goals or mobilize local players. There is often a disconnect between national policy goals and on-the-ground dynamics. Instead, government should adopt a network perspective which does not eliminate state action, but involves network management institutions at arm's length of government. As an example for this mode of network governance, the research looks at the Swedish National Network for Wind Power, which was initiated by government and is now led by four wind coordinators managing the development of on- and off-shore wind electricity. The paper compares Swedish performance before and after the introduction of the wind network and shows how these government efforts have transformed Sweden from a weak performer to being a frontrunner in Europe.

AB  - Swedish foresters are placing increasing reliance in burning of forestland and green tree retention, in order to enhance biodiversity in the Swedish boreal forests. However, much remains to be learned about how to optimise nature conservation goals by different logging and burning procedures. We monitored the survival of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi as mycorrhizas, at a clear-cut, a seed tree stand and an uncut stand of Scots pine in central Sweden, with and without burning at two levels of fire severity. The abundance of mycorrhizas and the EM fungal diversity declined with increased logging intensity and with increased depth of burn. Deep burning fires in combination with logging or fire-caused tree mortality can kill much of the existing EM community. Logging intensity, fire intensity and fire severity are all factors that can be manipulated, thus changing the effects on EM fungi and other soil biota. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural history was investigated by means of pollen and charcoal analyses from the sediment of Lake Kirjavalampi in the Riekkalansaari Island, in the northern archipelago of Lake Ladoga, NW Russia (61degrees44'N, 30degrees46'E). Pollen and charcoal stratigraphies, and loss-on-ignition were analysed from a 0-294-cm profile cored from the deepest part of the small lake. The pollen profile was divided into six local pollen assemblage zones Kir 1-6 and dated by three radiocarbon samples. Lake Kirjavalampi was isolated from Lake Ladoga between 1460-1300 B.C., when the River Neva was formed as a new outlet for Lake Ladoga and the water level rapidly fell. The isolation is seen as a phase of rapid sedimentation in Kir 2 (237-173 cm). Spruce (Picea) starts to decline at 113 cm ca. A.D. 70, and the earliest cereal (Secale cereale) pollen was encountered at the 97-cm level, empirically dating the onset of cultivation to ca. A.D. 600. A marked intensification in agricultural activities occurs around A.D. 1200, and the indication of an open cultivated landscape is at its strongest during the time period 1700 to 1850.

AB  - The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) reports to the general public fisheries 'landings' not 'total removals' for north-east Atlantic waters. Thus, public data do not include all anthropogenic removals, including discards. We reconstructed total removals for the nine countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden) fishing in the Baltic Sea by estimating their unreported removals. Estimated total removals of 53.5 million tonnes are 30% higher than the 41.3 million tonnes ICES reports publicly for 1950-2007. During 2000-2007, total removals are 35% higher than reported data suggest. The major components of unreported removals since 2000 were unreported landings, discards and recreational removals. Unreported landings were dominated by Poland (47%), Sweden (12%), Denmark (10%) and Latvia (8%), while discarding was dominated by Poland (21%), Denmark (19%), Finland (15%) and Sweden (14%). Finland (32%) and Sweden (30%) contributed the most to recreational removals. While ICES includes some estimates of unreported landings and discards in their stock assessment process, the lack of comprehensive and transparent public reporting on a society-owned resource presents a hindrance to accountability and ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Aim Conserving freshwater biodiversity in a rapidly changing world requires updated planning schemes and research efforts. Geodiversity - the diversity of Earth surface forms, materials and processes - and biodiversity are interlinked at a fundamental level. This relationship is being considered in a growing number of studies, yet research from freshwater environments is scarce. We used geodiversity (rock-type, soil-type and geomorphological richness), local and climatic variables to explore whether geodiversity can be used as a surrogate for aquatic plant species richness in lakes and rivers. Location Finland. Taxon Aquatic plants. Methods We compared geodiversity variables (measured within 1-km(2) grid cells) to well-studied local (e.g. area, alkalinity) and climate (e.g. growing degree-days) variables, and examined the patterns between habitat types (lakes and rivers) and among all taxa and major functional groups (helophytes and hydrophytes). We modelled lake (n = 145) and river (n = 146) plant species richness with generalized linear models, and further partitioned variation to measure the independent and shared contributions of the geodiversity, climate and local environmental variable groups. As a complementary analysis, and to identify single important variables explaining variation in aquatic plant species richness, we utilized boosted regression trees. Results We found a positive relationship between aquatic plant species richness and catchment geodiversity variation with recurring patterns across two different freshwater habitat types and two aquatic plant functional groups. Higher variation in geodiversity (measured at landscape scale) supported higher freshwater biodiversity (measured at the local scale) of lakes and rivers. Main conclusions Geodiversity can be a useful addition to biodiversity modelling, and it should be considered in conservation schemes and monitoring efforts, further supporting the principle of conserving nature's stage. Yet, differences between habitats and functional groups suggest that more habitat-specific approaches and multiple biodiversity measures should be considered. Our study is an important signpost guiding further studies on the biodiversity-geodiversity relationship in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Implementing culture-based development strategies is a recent trend in large and small cities all over Europe. The definition of culture and the objectives of cultural strategies are highly contested in the public debate. Analysing the newspaper debates on the establishment of the Cultiva foundation in Kristiansand, Norway, this article discusses how and why the discursive debate on the definition of culture creates different discursive positions in the public debate on culture-based development. In the different discourses on what these strategies should be, there are a number of antagonisms that contribute to defining the relationships and interfaces between the different discursive positions. The main lines of discursive conflict are between urban planners and/or policy-makers who follow a spatial logic that emphasises a comprehensive understanding of territorial planning and cultural workers and/or artists who follow a critical artistic creation logic that emphasises the values that exist in art and the potential of the cultural field for personal development, general education and social criticism.

AB  - We present a novel procedure based on eco-efficiency for assessing farm-level effects of technology adoption while considering secondary effects. Secondary effects are defined as structural and behavioural adaptations to technology that may impact environmental, social or economic outcomes. We apply the procedure to automatic milking systems (AMS) in Norway and find that AMS induces secondary effects, most strongly by decreasing labour per cow and increasing herd sizes. For estimating effects of AMS we employ a novel causal machine learning approach. AMS induce heterogenous effects on eco-efficiency, negatively associated with herd expansion and labour per cow.

AB  - This paper investigates a greenfield mining project in a peripheral region in northern Sweden through the analysis of how different actor groups formed their own 'horizons of expectations' that temporally became fused, only to crumble together with the mining company in a short period of time. By focusing on the co-evolvement of expectations, we show how expectations are differentiated along geographical and temporal scales, reflect upon how these differences relate to interests and historical memory, and finally what these differences mean for the development of large-scale, long-term, raw materials-based projects devoted to industrial production in depopulating areas in an economy otherwise orientated towards neoliberal governance and post-industrial development. By doing so, we make a theoretical contribution to the literature on expectations through the introduction of the concept 'horizon of expectations', and a contribution to the literature on neoliberalism and its cultural-geographical implications.

AB  - Forest policies and management rules imposed on forests in Romania provide favourable habitat conditions for many species across forest landscapes. This is empirically proven by the high biodiversity of the Carpathians and their surroundings. However, they do not explicitly address the spatial arrangement of forest patches across landscapes. Therefore, assessment of the connectivity (inside tracts of continuous forest - i.e. intrapatch connectivity - and also among spatially separate patches - i.e. interpatch connectivity) is important. To analyze this, the CORINE Land Cover data set (2012) available for Romania was used. Forest patches were classified into three size categories considered to ensure survival of tree populations on short term, medium and long term: Interconnectivity Nodes (IN: 1,5 to 14,9 ha, minimum 30 m width), Habitat Islands (HI: 15,0 ha and 499,0 ha, minimum 100 m width) and Habitat Continuum (HC: over 500 ha with a minimum 200 m width) respectively. The connectivity of each patch to others around it was assessed for a maximum threshold distance of 1 km. Further connectivity was classified in terms of its strength (depending on the size category to which a patch is connected) and quality (size and structure of a resulting connected cluster). Next, the distributions of the main forest tree species on the various sizes, connectivity strength and quality patches of forest vegetation were assessed. The results showed good connectivity between forest patches, both in terms of intrapatch connectivity (85% of the area was included in the HC class) and interpatch connectivity (92,4% are included in 12 clusters over 10.000 ha; among these the one around Carpathians comprised 86,7% of the total forest area). The main tree species showed good connectivity in general, higher in mountainous areas than at lower elevations (area in Habitat Continuum patches: 97,5% for Norway spruce vs. 63,3% for pedunculate oak; strong connection - 97,8% for Norway spruce vs. 67,2% for pedunculate oak; high quality connectivity - 98,2% for Norway spruce vs. 68,6% for pedunculate oak). These results confirm that management policies and guidelines inherited from the past provide good conditions for connectivity of the main forest tree species and for forests in general. Further enforcement of these practices in the future should ensure the conservation of species across the forested landscapes at national scale and also provide routes for species migration in the context of climate change. However, as a large proportion of forestland is today not state-owned, financial incentives for private owners are a key condition for further acceptance of these policies and ensure these major goals are met.

AB  - The transition to a sustainable society requires the development of visions paving the way for socio-technical changes. In recent years, the literature on sustainable transitions and urban planning has highlighted the intermediation role of municipalities to implement international and national goals and visions at a local level. Yet, empirical research studying municipalities from the lens of the intermediation theory are sparse. This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of what strategies municipalities use when intermediating between and within different scales of governance (i.e. local, national and international), and what factors influence the choice of strategies. Through semi-structured interviews and document studies, three Swedish municipalities are studied. Results show that these municipalities translate the visions through local experiments, task delegation and coalitions. Additionally, the analysis indicates that the local circumstances, rather than the relations between the local level and the higher levels of governance or the guidance of national policies, influence the choice of intermediation strategy. Particularly, whether the management approach is centralized or decentralized, result- or process-oriented, participative or exclusive, is determinant. Results also indicate that municipalities perform both top-down and bottom-up intermediation, i.e. closing the loop from the local to the national and/or international levels.

AB  - 1. Land-use change can disrupt associations between different trophic groups, but it is unclear if habitat restoration can recover these associations. In Sweden, restoration efforts have been applied to increase areas of semi-natural grassland previously remaining as small fragments due to abandonment. We assessed how the associations between plant and pollinator communities can be modified by grassland abandonment and restoration, together with landscape connectivity.
   2. We surveyed plant, hoverfly and bee communities in 10 abandoned, 18 restored and 10 intact grasslands in south-central Sweden, distributed along a gradient of isolation from other species-rich grasslands. We assessed the effects of management history and connectivity on the relationships between several measures of the composition of plant and pollinator communities as well as between plant community composition and pollinator guilds.
   3. The composition of the local flowering plant community was an important determinant of both hoverfly and bee communities. However, plant-pollinator associations were modulated by landscape connectivity and, to some extent, by grassland management history. Abundance, species richness and functional richness of bees and species richness of hoverflies were positively associated with local plant communities in isolated grasslands, but these associations weakened in well-connected grasslands. In contrast, hoverfly abundance correlated positively with plant communities in well-connected grasslands.
   4. The response of pollinator feeding guilds was consistent with overall pollinator communities. However, abundance of bees adapted to foraging on particular plants (long-tongued and short-tongued) responded positively to specific host plant species abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show how land use and landscape context can significantly affect interactions between different trophic levels. Land use and landscape context should therefore be recognised in grassland restoration guidelines. Enhancement of both functional-rich and species-rich plant communities, as well as increasing abundance and species and functional richness of host plants for specialist pollinators will amend pollinator diversity. Restoration actions should consider the spatial configuration of the landscape to improve its outcome. Efforts in more isolated grasslands should focus on promoting local habitat quality while, in more connected grasslands, the priority should be maintaining connectivity to well-preserved grasslands.

AB  - Achieving sustainability goals in shared marine ecosystems is often undermined by different nation state marine governance systems, conflict over jurisdictional boundaries, and geopolitical differences. Moreover, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is politically charged in cross-border areas resulting in institutional fragmentation. Decision-making processes are embedded in different legislative approaches, cultures, fiscal, and administrative procedures which are unable to adequately consider the specificities of these areas. Greater integration is required to deliver sustainable outcomes. However, academic literature regarding integration in MSP fail to incorporate the co-evolution of institutions and this remains a wholly undeveloped area of MSP research. This paper contributes to the emerging MSP discourse by revisiting the understanding of institutional barriers to effective MSP implementation. The island of Ireland is selected as a case study to demonstrate how MSP legislation, policies and plans are emerging with limited coherence contrary to requirements under the EU MSP Directive 2014/89/EU and the UK Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. Findings from series of interviews with key stakeholders on the island of Ireland are discussed. The analysis focuses on key barriers identified by utilising Ansong et al.'s 'Wheel of Integration and Adaptation' [1] under the themes of structural alignment, community and self-action, decision making, collaborative learning, leading structured intervention, and collaborative capacity. The paper concludes by presenting different intervention pathways to addressing the management and planning of contested marine areas.

AB  - The long-term impact of natural and human-induced large-scale changes on aquatic phanerogams and charophytes has remained mostly unstudied in the Baltic Sea, largely because of a lack of historical data. A vegetation data set based on transects in an estuary in the western part of the Gulf of Finland studied in the 1930s-1940s, however, exists. We re-surveyed 91 of these transects in 2005 and 2007. The historical data set included 60 species and the contemporary 52 species. The species were classified into increasing, decreasing or unchanged according to the change in their occurrence frequencies. A significant frequency change was found for 31 of the 50 (62%) species which were present in both surveys. The proportion of species/growth forms with high-nitrogen and low-light preferences increased, whereas that of species/growth forms preferring oligotrophic conditions and species of shallow waters decreased. In the area, the species expanded their distribution ranges mainly towards the open sea. Eutrophication, reduced grazing pressure and shore overgrowth by Phragmites australis are suggested as the main reasons for the observed changes. In addition, increased boating and shore-construction activities contributed to the long-term floristic changes.

AB  - Retention forestry, also known as green tree retention or variable retention is a silvicultural approach in which small patches of forest or individual trees are retained during harvesting. The most com- mon form of retention forestry is leaving clumps of old trees and scattered individual trees in clearcuts, mimicking the natural dynamics of a disturbance such as windthrow or fire. The main purpose of such management is to maintain biodiversity, to provide dead wood, to improve soil conservation, and to diversify open clearcut areas. This article presents research findings on this topic, primarily highlighting the ecological benefits of retention forestry. The article also highlights the negative consequences, mainly economic, of leaving groups of mature trees on small clearcuts. In Poland, this practice mainly concerns pine stands, so the biotic and abiotic hazards associated with this group of tree species are highlighted. In some cases, these hazards can reduce the posi- tive effect of tree groups related to biodiversity. Ways to change this practice that minimize the negative impacts of leaving groups of trees are suggested. From the standpoint of maintaining greater biodiversity, more attention should be paid to a proper selection of potential tree groups in the stand, with priority given to valuable admixture species, hollow trees, and trees with unusual shapes. To limit the risk of wind damage to remaining tree groups, they should be selected well in advance of felling and the slenderness index of trees should be lowered by thinning to make them more wind resistant. Given the small size of clearcuts in Poland, voluntary use of old- growth islands on clearcuts should be considered, especially in forests on former agricultural land and in locations that are conducive to wind damage. In small clearcuts, the function of a 'lifeboat' for plant, fungal, and animal species can be equally well-fulfilled by stands adjacent to the clearcut. One solution worth considering is leaving large fragments of intact stand at the scale of larger forest tracts.

AB  - The emission-exposure and exposure-response (toxicity) relationships are different for different emission source categories of anthropogenic primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These variations have a potentially crucial importance in the integrated assessment, when determining cost-effective abatement strategies. We studied the importance of these variations by conducting a sensitivity analysis for an integrated assessment model. The model was developed to estimate the adverse health effects to the Finnish population attributable to primary PM2.5 emissions from the whole of Europe. The primary PM2.5 emissions in the whole of Europe and in more detail in Finland were evaluated using the inventory of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and the Finnish Regional Emission Scenario model (FRES), respectively. The emission-exposure relationships for different primary PM2.5 emission source categories in Finland have been previously evaluated and these values incorporated as intake fractions into the integrated assessment model. The primary PM2.5 exposure-response functions and toxicity differences for the pollution originating from different source categories were estimated in an expert elicitation study performed by six European experts on air pollution health effects. The primary PM2.5 emissions from Finnish and other European sources were estimated for the population of Finland in 2000 to be responsible for 209 (mean, 95% confidence interval 6-739) and 357 (mean, 95% CI 8-1482) premature deaths, respectively. The inclusion of emission-exposure and toxicity variation into the model increased the predicted relative importance of traffic related primary PM2.5 emissions and correspondingly, decreased the predicted relative importance of other emission source categories. We conclude that the variations of emission-exposure relationship and toxicity between various source categories had significant impacts for the assessment on premature deaths caused by primary PM2.5.

AB  - Our study compared the soil collembolan at three semi-natural sites (a beech forest, a beech-fir forest and a fir stand) and three managed sites (Norway spruce, beech-fir and fir). Collembola were extracted from a total of 60 samples with a Bertese-Tullgren funnel, counted and identified to species level. A total of 7187 specimens, representing 51 species and 37 genera, were collected. There were significant differences between managed and natural forests (t-test, P = 0.000). The communities and their population densities were significantly lower in the managed site: 51 species with 708,498 ind m(-2) in the semi-natural forests to 36 species and 306,042 ind m(-2) in the managed stands. The endemic component suffered a particularly severe decrease in species richness and abundance (57% and 71% tower in the managed forests, respectively). These species with narrow distribution and small local populations are doubly vulnerable to alterations of environmental conditions. They are very sensitive to loss of their natural habitat owing to human intervention and thus represent useful indicators of tolerance to environmental stress. We highlight the need to take endemic species into consideration in studies on the conservation of biodiversity because they are most at risk of extinction. Semi-natural forests are refuges for endemic species and should be protected. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The abundance of the parasitic salmon louse has increased with the growth in aquaculture of salmonids in open net pens. This represents a threat to wild salmonid populations as well as a key limiting factor for salmon farming. The Norwegian 'traffic light' management system for salmon farming aims to increase aquaculture production while securing sustainable wild salmonid populations. However, this system is at present solely focusing on mortality in wild Atlantic salmon, while the responses of sea trout with different ecological characteristics are not included. We analyse lice counts on sea trout from surveillance data and use Bayesian statistical models to relate observed lice infestations to the environmental lice infestation pressure, salinity and current speed. These models can be used in risk assessment to predict when and where lice numbers surpass threshold levels for expected serious health effects in wild sea trout. We find that in production areas with the highest density of salmon farms (West coast), more than 50% of the sea trout experienced lice infestations above the levels of expected serious health effects. We also observed high lice infestations on sea trout in areas with salinities below louse tolerance levels, indicating that fish had been infested elsewhere but were returning to low-saline waters to delouse. This behavioural response may over time disrupt anadromy in sea trout. The observed infestations on sea trout can be explained by the hydrodynamic lice dispersal model, which provides continuous estimates of lice exposure along the whole Norwegian coast. These estimates, which are used in Atlantic salmon research and management, can also be used for sea trout. Synthesis and applications. Wild sea trout, spending its entire feeding migration in fjords and coastal areas, is at higher risk than wild Atlantic salmon to lice infestations from industrial salmon farming. The high levels of lice infestation we observed on sea trout question the environmental sustainability of the current aquaculture industry in areas with intensive farming. We discuss the complex responses of sea trout to salmon lice and how the Norwegian 'traffic light' management system may include data on sea trout.

AB  - The concept of old-growth in temperate forests is based on two underlying ecological concepts. Firstly, old-growth forests are 'late successional' or 'climax' forests that are compositionally, functionally and structurally distinct from the other successional stages of the same forest type. Secondly, they are relatively undisturbed by humans. We examined these concepts in relation to the use of old-growth characteristics as a means of identifying high conservation value temperate forests and highlight some of the problems associated with identifying old-growth. The application of this criterion alone will not meet the goal of maintaining biodiversity in terms of species richness, nor will it maintain the structural and functional diversity of ecosystems. The criterion becomes much more useful when used in the context of forest landscapes.

AB  - Protected areas are considered fundamental to counter biodiversity loss. However, evidence for their effectiveness in averting local extinctions remains scarce and taxonomically biased. We employ a robust counterfactual multi-taxon approach to compare occupancy patterns of 638 species, including birds (150), mammals (23), plants (39) and phytoplankton (426) between protected and unprotected sites across four decades in Finland. We find mixed impacts of protected areas, with only a small proportion of species explicitly benefiting from protection-mainly through slower rates of decline inside protected areas. The benefits of protection are enhanced for larger protected areas and are traceable to when the sites were protected, but are mostly unrelated to species conservation status or traits (size, climatic niche and threat status). Our results suggest that the current protected area network can partly contribute to slow down declines in occupancy rates, but alone will not suffice to halt the biodiversity crisis. Efforts aimed at improving coverage, connectivity and management will be key to enhance the effectiveness of protected areas towards bending the curve of biodiversity loss.

AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly being used to detect cultural remains in forest landscapes. Boreal forests are challenging, however, since most ancient land use was carried out without major permanent ground disturbances. If this challenge can be met, there is a large potential for surveys through existing nation-wide laser-scanning programs, although their resolutions tend to be low. In this study, we compare the performance of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) ALS data in the Krycklan catchment in northern Sweden, an area where ancient land use was small-scale and diverse. About three times as many cultural remains were detected in the HR data set, but the LR set was satisfactory for distinct structures. We analyze how LR data sets can be enhanced at ground-point classification and terrain-model generation and conclude that ALS data have a large potential for the detection and protection of cultural remains in the boreal forest.

AB  - We organized a large-scale pilot on gypsum amendment of arable fields in southwest Finland, along the River Savijoki to examine its effects on phosphorus loads and aquatic environment, and to assess its feasibility as a water protection measure. This paper reports findings on the feasibility aspects of gypsum amendment covering logistics and costs of spreading, abatement potential and farmers' experience. We found that farmers perceived gypsum amendment positively and the costs of reducing phosphorus are low relative to other measures available in agriculture. Gypsum amendment suits well to 0.5 million hectares of arable land in southern Finland. Gypsum could potentially contribute considerably to the achievement of phosphorus reduction targets of the Baltic Sea Action Plan if applied in all countries having clay soils.

AB  - Agricultural drought can severely reduce crop yields, lead to large economic losses and health impacts. Combined climate and land use variations determine key indicators of agricultural drought, including soil moisture and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). This study investigated the use of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting these indicators over Sweden, spanning steep climate and land use gradients. Three data arrangement methods (multi-features, temporal, and spatial) were used and compared in combination with seven ML/deep learning (DL) models (random forest (RF), decision tree, multivariate linear regression, support vector regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (AMIRA), artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network). Seven investigated features, obtained from Google Earth Engine, were used in the ML/DL modeling (soil moisture, PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, elevation, slope and soil texture). The temporal ARIMA model (found most suitable for local scale prediction) and the multi-features RF model (more suitable for national-scale prediction) emerged as best performing for soil moisture prediction (with MAE of 9.1 and 11.95, and R2 of 0.79 and 0.59, respectively). All models generally performed better in predicting the soil moisture than the PDSI indicator of drought. For drought indicator prediction and mapping, previous-year average monthly soil moisture emerged as the most important feature, combined with the four additional corresponding features of PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration and elevation.

AB  - 1. Litter sex ratio variation in enclosed populations of two strains of root voles originating from northern and southern Norway was studied in experimentally fragmented habitats during 2. years (1990 and 1991) in the period early July-mid October.
   2. Three fragmentation patterns differing with respect to habitat fragment size and interfragment connectivity (corridors) were colonized by voles from either strain in each of the 9 years; yielding two population replicates per strain and fragmentation pattern. Litter affiliation of weanlings was decided from a combination of trapping data, marking of lactating mothers with fluorescent powder and marking of nestlings.
   3. Habitat fragmentation had no consistent influence on weanling sex ratio at the population level. However, within populations of both strains, mothers inhabiting a habitat fragment alone produced more female-biased litters than those sharing a fragment with other reproductive females.
   4. For the south Norwegian strain, large mothers produced more female-biased litters than small mothers. The southern strain had an overall female-biased weanling sex ratio the first year, probably because reproductive females were generally heavier in 1990 than in 1991.
   5. The results are consistent with hypotheses predicting that females should adjust the litter sex ratio according to resource availability and social environment at a local scale, as well as to their own competitive ability. It is argued that adaptive sex ratio variation in Microtus is more probably due to spatial variability of fitness returns from daughters than from sons, because females are the philopatric sex and compete at a smaller spatial scale than males.

AB  - This paper analyses and discusses how and to what extent social learning (SL), as a means to address complex adaptive problems in water governance, can be enabled in local and regional multi-stakeholder collaborations. Using a multi-method, qualitative, collaborative, and self-reflective case study design, the conditions, challenges, and enablers for SL were studied, comparing three complementary cases of voluntary multi-actor platforms (water councils) to improve water quality in West Sweden. These councils were established to foster the implementation of the Water Frame Directive and-on a voluntary basis without a formal decision mandate or responsibility-to implement measures or act. Using participant observation, evaluation workshops, and a survey, the methods employed by the councils, which were founded on trust-based approaches, were assessed based on how they contributed to trust and social learning. Observed outcomes included an increased number of participants, sub-projects, local water groups, and measures. Respondents mentioned better dialogue, higher commitment, and broader knowledge as positive outcomes. Based on this, we conclude that there is a need for neutral spaces for meetings led by process facilitators, enabling cross-sectorial and cross-level exchanges, a process which is not common in Swedish water management.

AB  - Larix decidua, the European Larch tree, is a typical forest species of the Southern Alps of North Italy growing in mixture with Picea, in isolated pure stands, or as solitary trees on meadows at 1000-2000 in elevation. Presently, the old-growth Larix forests show no regeneration, while Picea abies, Norway spruce, invades at lower elevation, and Pinus cembra, Stone pine, at higher elevation. In this study, we investigate the conditions that lead to pure stands of L. decidua in the past. It is shown that intensive land-use of grazing was essential for Larix regeneration, and that the pure stands of Larix will disappear in the future with the change of land-use, unless management will be intensified again to produce mineral soil for Larix to regenerate.

AB  - Shellfish carrying capacity is determined by the interaction of cultured species with the ecosystem, principally constrained by environmental characteristics, especially food availability. A recent experiment carried out in Lysefjord (SW Norway) has shown that induced upwelling of nutrient-rich deeper water stimulated phytoplankton growth, potentially increasing the carrying capacity for mussel cultivation. With the aim of assisting in development of sustainable mussel culture in Lysefjord, an object-oriented model of aquaculture-environment interactions and mussel carrying capacity was constructed. A multiple box ecosystem model was developed within the visual simulation environment of Simile software allowing explicit coupling between boxes, which represent regions of the fjord. Once the box model was developed and calibrated, subsequent application of PEST (Parameter ESTimation) allowed optimization of different parameters of the model in order to manage mussel production according to carrying capacity criteria. The Simile model and the simultaneous application of PEST allowed several scenarios taking into account different stocking densities, upwelling alternatives, and the creation of new cultivation areas.

AB  - In this study, we estimate baseline conditions in terms of the current risk of well salinization on the Baltic Sea island of Oland, Sweden, and assess the effects of future sea level rise on the land area, infrastructure and cultural values. We use a multicriterion geographical information systems (GIS) approach. Geomorphological and physical parameters affect the risk of saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers, including their hydrology, geomorphology, and climatology; the spatial distribution of the current risk of salinization is mapped in this study. In the event of a future 2 m sea level rise, a total land area of 67 km(2) will be inundated on Oland, corresponding to approximately 5% of the island's land surface. Inundation includes urban areas, nature reserves, and animal protection areas, implying the loss of environmental and socioeconomic values. A future 2 m sea level rise will also cause direct inundation of 3% of all wells on the island. Currently, 17.5% of all wells are at a high risk of becoming saltwater contaminated. More generally, the present results add evidence showing a relatively high vulnerability of major Baltic Sea islands and their infrastructure to future sea level rise. The approach used here and related results, including salinization risk maps, may prove useful for decision-makers in the planning of infrastructure. Drilling of new wells could for instance preferably be done in areas with identified lower risk-index values, which would facilitate an overall higher freshwater withdrawal in the interest of the entire island.

AB  - Key message Forest owners who maximize profitability with a low discount rate or whose management goals are related to conservation and recreation, rarely sell timber. These owners make it difficult to achieve the high harvesting targets of the growing bioeconomy sector of Finland. To increase timber supply, these landowners should be informed about alternative silvicultural methods. Context The round wood harvests from Finnish forests are increasing and approaching to the level of maximum sustainable cut. Cutting budget calculations assume that forests are harvested in an optimal way for national timber supply. The calculations ignore the variability of landowners' forest management preferences. Aims This study analyzed the effect of variation in the management objectives and silvicultural preferences of forest landowners on the forecasted timber supply from Finnish forests. Methods Forest owners were divided into savers (net present value maximized with a 1% discount rate), average owners (3% discount rate), and investors (5% discount rate). The owners of each group were further divided into three groups: those who allow only continuous cover management (12%), owners who use only rotation forest management (10%), and indifferent landowners who may use both silvicultural systems (78%). Scenarios were composed of management prescriptions that were optimized separately for the different groups of forest landowners. Results Compared to the even-flow timber drain scenario for rotation forest management (calculated without acknowledging the varying preferences of landowners), the scenario where the owners' preferences varied decreased harvested volume by 15-19% during a 100-year calculation period. The main reason for the difference was the saver type of landowners who rarely sell timber. Conclusion It was concluded that variation of the preferences of forest landowners may make it challenging to meet the increasing harvesting targets of the growing bioeconomy of Finland.

AB  - The rotation forestry system provides high biomass production, but could also have a negative impact on species sensitive to disturbance. Continuous cover forestry (CCF) could contribute to solving these conflicting goals, but its feasibility in nutrient limited boreal forests is yet unresolved. In a unique experiment, we simultaneously assessed the short-term effect of single-tree selection on both biomass production and biodiversity (vascular plants, bryophytes, wood-inhabiting fungi), and tested fertilization as a way to mediate growth-biodiversity trade-offs. We found that unharvested stands and stands subjected to single-tree selection had a similar species assemblage of vascular plants, bryophytes, and wood-inhabiting fungi. Fertilization increased growth by 37% and induced shifts in two understory species (favoring the grass Avenella flexuosa and disfavoring the bryophyte Hylocomium splendens). We conclude that single-tree selection may become a useful tool to enhance biodiversity in managed forests.

AB  - The use of cultivated seaweeds as a feedstock for multiple industrial applications has gained increasing interest in the Western World over the past decades. Norway has an extensive coastline and a well-established aquaculture sector offering suitable preconditions for developing large-scale cultivation of seaweed biomass both in monoculture and in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems. Recent efforts from research, industry and public authorities have been committed to develop a Norwegian bio-economy based on cultivated seaweed, focusing on cultivation and processing of the biomass. This review reports on the status of seaweed aquaculture in Norway, supported by production data collected since the delivery of the first commercial cultivation permits at sea in 2014. Although novel product developments are currently limited, future industrial perspectives based on cultivated biomass are being discussed. Upscaling from experimental cultivation schemes to commercial production requires a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits associated with seaweed aquaculture, as well as the development of a regulative framework adapted to this industry. Issues associated with upscaling the macroalgal production that needs to be addressed includes (i) genetic interactions between cultivated and wild crops, (ii) impacts of seaweed cultivation on surrounding ecosystems, (iii) epiphytes and diseases, (iv) area utilization and (v) threats from climate change. Addressing these issues and adapting production practices will ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of an emerging industry based on cultivated seaweed biomass in Norway.

AB  - To allocate resources effectively to reduce nitrate leaching and the resulting adverse effects on the environment, it is of great importance to quantify the contribution from different agricultural management practices and different agro-environmental conditions. In this paper we present a decision support tool, SOILNDB, that can be used to quantify nitrogen leaching losses from large areas of arable land where the availability of detailed data is limited. SOILNDB is also a useful tool for studying the effects of changes in agricultural management and land use on leaching, and for evaluating alternative management practices to minimise nitrogen leaching. The basis for SOILNDB is two widely used 'research models', SOIL and SOILN, which describe water and heat fluxes, and nitrogen transformation and transport processes in the soil. A parameter database and parameter estimation algorithms are used to convert the input data in SOILNDB to parameter values for the SOIL-SOILN models. Model outputs can be presented either in a summarised form with yearly averages, or in more detail as a time series with daily resolution. An illustrative example simulation shows how the model can be used to compare nitrate leaching under alternative management practices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global trends influence the approaches and mindset for using natural resources and technological capacities. Participatory scenario methods have proven useful in long-term foresight. However, country-level foresight studies often ignore the broader trends affecting international markets and setting frames for economic development. This study envisions which global trends could occur and how the resulting European policies might affect the Finnish forest sector's development in 2040. We applied a Futures Wheel approach, where stakeholder groups consisting of policy-, economic- and social sustainability-, technology-, and climate sustainability -experts in the field of forestry and interlinking industries created three future scenarios in a workshop: (1) biodiversity and regulated economy, (2) circular economy, and (3) era of social connection. The scenarios assumed growing resource scarcity as a result of climate change, as well as over-consumption and increasing inequality problems globally. Thus, European-level policies focused on the circular economy and resource-use restrictions. Finnish industries should invest in wood-based side stream and waste utilization to increase added value and decrease virgin wood uses to succeed in these scenarios. However, this would require investments in non-wood energy sources to release these secondary wood flows from energy uses.

AB  - The present paper presents the practical implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in Norway. This involves defining management objectives and developing simple and efficient tools to achieve an overview of management needs and prioritise among these, while integrating broader conservation issues and ensuring stakeholder invdIvement. A new Marine Resources Act entered into force in Norway in 2009. By integrating conservation and sustainable use as basic principles, the law represents a paradigm shift in the management of Norwegian fisheries. The law indicates which concerns should be addressed, but neither how nor how often evaluations should take place. That is for management to decide. A management principle in the Marine Resources Act confers on the Ministry an obligation to evaluate whether continued fishing at the present scale is justifiable, or whether improved management is required to ensure sustainability. A Stock table, and a table of "Catches of data-poor species" constitute a comprehensive system for monitoring the management principle. Along with a Fisheries table, these tables establish a framework for developing an ecosystem-based fisheries management by providing a basis and tools for prioritising the needs of new and/or revised management measures.

AB  - The development of the Finnish Starling Sturnus vulgaris population was studied, using data from 20 local populations and from the national ringing scheme extending from the beginning of the 1960s to the end of the 1980s (data for 7-26 years from each population). According to local studies, the population size started to decrease in the late 1960s, and fell to about 20% by the early 1980s. In the timing of the decrease, there were clear regional and local differences. Clutch size varied significantly among local populations (range of the means of annual means in three populations: 4.7-5.3 eggs; data from 12-21 years), but there were much greater differences in the number of fledglings (range in the same populations: 2.33-3.99 fledglings, with 3.52-4.87 for four other populations; data from 5-21 years). These differences were caused by differences in foraging habitat. According to national ringing data, brood size at the age of ringing increased significantly (by 0.04 nestlings/year) during the period of 1968-89. The mean brood size decreased towards the north. This decline seems be due to large-scale abandoning of dairy farming in southern Finland. This has resulted in losses of good foraging habitats (pastures and leys) for the Starlings, and, as consequence, to reduced reproductive success in the whole south Finnish population. The continuous increase of brood size at the age of ringing reflects the disappearance of Starlings from poor breeding habitats and the strong decrease in northern Finland.

AB  - Coastal Zone Management must address situations that are inherently complex, diverse, dynamic, and risky. What management systems are best able to handle such challenges? What ambitions are realistic for coastal zone managers? This article reflects on Norway's coastal zone management experience. In particular, we dwell with the tendency to postpone, or even neglect, making the hard decisions and to rationalize non-decision by referring to some beliefs or myths regarding the situation in the coastal zone, variously that (a) space is no limitation, (b) spatial delimitation is all it takes, and (c) coastal culture will always self-heal. Finally, we argue that risk-management may be a more fruitful/realistic management ambition than aiming for some positively defined goals.

AB  - The river-resident Salmo salar (smablank) has been isolated from other Atlantic salmon populations for 9,500years in upper River Namsen, Norway. This is the only European Atlantic salmon population accomplishing its entire life cycle in a river. Hydropower development during the last six decades has introduced movement barriers and changed more than 50% of the river habitat to lentic conditions. Based on microsatellites and SNPs, genetic variation within smablank was only about 50% of that in the anadromous Atlantic salmon within the same river. The genetic differentiation (F-ST) between smablank and the anadromous population was 0.24. This is similar to the differentiation between anadromous Atlantic salmon in Europe and North America. Microsatellite analyses identified three genetic subpopulations within smablank, each with an effective population size N-e of a few hundred individuals. There was no evidence of reduced heterozygosity and allelic richness in contemporary samples (2005-2008) compared with historical samples (1955-56 and 1978-79). However, there was a reduction in genetic differentiation between sampling localities over time. SNP data supported the differentiation of smablank into subpopulations and revealed downstream asymmetric gene flow between subpopulations. In spite of this, genetic variation was not higher in the lower than in the upper areas. The meta-population structure of smablank probably maintains genetic variation better than one panmictic population would do, as long as gene flow among subpopulations is maintained. Smablank is a unique endemic island population of Atlantic salmon. It is in a precarious situation due to a variety of anthropogenic impacts on its restricted habitat area. Thus, maintaining population size and avoiding further habitat fragmentation are important.

AB  - New patterns of working, the globalisation of production and the introduction of information technologies are changing the way we work. This new working environment has eliminated some risks whilst introducing others. The importance of the psychosocial working environment for the health of employees is now well documented, but the effects of managerial style have received relatively little attention. Yet management is an increasingly important aspect of companies' policies. In this paper, we examine the relationship between conflict management in the workplace and self-reported measures of stress, poor general health, exhaustion and sickness absence due to overstrain or fatigue. Our sample consists of non-supervisory employees (N = 9309) working in the Swedish and Finnish plants of a multinational forestry company who were surveyed in 2000. Bivariate analyses show that those who report that differences are resolved through discussion are least likely to report stress, poor general health, exhaustion or sickness absence. Those who report that authority is used or that no attempts are made to resolve differences have quite similar rates across all measures. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed for all health outcomes controlling for age, sex, occupational group, job complexity, job autonomy and support from superiors. Results show significantly lower likelihoods of reporting stress, poor general health, exhaustion or sickness absence amongst employees who report that differences of opinion are resolved through discussion compared to those who report that no attempts are made. No significant differences were found between those who reported that differences were resolved through use of authority and subjects in the 'no attempt' category. These results suggest that the workplace conflict resolution is important in the health of employees in addition to traditional psychosocial work environment risk factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Short rotation forestry in its present context deals mainly with willows and to some extent with alders and poplars. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss which direct and indirect environmental factors that are improved in such a way that there is a clear justification for promoting growth and use of short-rotation forestry in Sweden. It is clear that willow cultivation promotes biodiversity, if established and managed correctly, compared with conventional agriculture and forestry. Its capacity to efficiently take up nutrients and heavy metals (including cadmium) is shown in several experiments. In this respect, widow can be used as a vegetation filter for wastewater treatment instead of conventional treatment plants. Calculations have shown that the economy of such filters is more favourable than that of conventional plants, at least for societies up to 2000 person equivalents (pe). SRF crops, used for heating purposes, are carbon dioxide neutral and also reduce many of the air-polluting components compared with fossil fuels. The conclusion, therefore, must be that there are several justifications for growing and using SRF, not least as substitution for fossil fuels. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Climate change's burden is double for many Indigenous communities: while changing weather-patterns threaten their ways of life, greenlabeled extractive industries take hold in their territories. This article advances decolonial psychology's engagement with climate change mitigation as a form of green colonization through a multi-site study of lived experiences among Indigenous and Tribal communities affected by the production of "green aluminum." The study follows aluminum's value and supply chains interconnecting the indigenous Southern Saami people's struggle to defend their reindeer pasturing lands to the booming wind power industry in Norway and the Brazilian Amazon communities' confrontations with bauxite-mining and alumina refineries. Data material consists of individual interviews (N = 25), 13 group interviews and participatory observation. Despite sociocultural differences, participants narrated lived experiences of loss of lifeworlds and meaning-systems resulting from wind power and aluminum production, and harmful experiences with companies and bureaucracy thematized as forms of "bad faith." They discussed different mechanisms of violence and dehumanization in hegemonic green agendas. By highlighting how Green New Deal (GND) proposals in Norway forward aluminum-smelting as exemplar of just transition and green inclusion, the study's findings suggest that for proliferating GND's to be inclusive and just, their scope must be international and decolonial.

AB  - The Paris Agreement aims to limit global mean temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. This target has wide-ranging implications for Europe and its cities, which are the source of substantial greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reports the state of local planning for climate change by collecting and analysing information about local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the EU-28. A typology and framework for analysis was developed that classifies local climate plans in terms of their alignment with spatial (local, national and international) and other climate related policies. Out of eight types of local climate plans identified in total we document three types of stand-alone local climate plans classified as type Al (autonomously produced plans), A2 (plans produced to comply with national regulations) or A3 (plans developed for international climate networks). There is wide variation among countries in the prevalence of local climate plans, with generally more plans developed by central and northern European cities. Approximately 66% of EU cities have a type Al, A2, or A3 mitigation plan, 26% an adaptation plan, and 17% a joint adaptation and mitigation plan, while about 33% lack any form of stand-alone local climate plan (i.e. what we classify as Al, A2, A3 plans). Mitigation plans are more numerous than adaptation plans, but planning for mitigation does not always precede planning for adaptation. Our analysis reveals that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate plans. We found that size does matter as about 80% of the cities with above 500,000 inhabitants have a comprehensive and stand-alone mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (Al). Cities in four countries with national climate legislation (A2), i.e. Denmark, France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, are nearly twice as likely to produce local mitigation plans, and five times more likely to produce local adaptation plans, compared to cities in countries without such legislation. Al and A2 mitigation plans are particularly numerous in Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Finland: while Al and A2 adaptation plans are prevalent in Denmark, Finland, UK and France. The integration of adaptation and mitigation is country-specific and can mainly be observed in two countries where local climate plans are compulsory, i.e. France and the UK. Finally, local climate plans produced for international climate networks (A3) are mostly found in the many countries where autonomous (type Al) plans are less common. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climate planning to date. The findings are of international importance as they will inform and support decision making towards climate planning and policy development at national, EU and global level being based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of local climate planning available to date.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to reflect on the low power distance levels of synergy in the Nordic Cluster countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland), and its direct influence on the learning by doing process. To measure the acceptance of inequality we will use the coefficient of correlation proposed by Pearson for the power distance differences between the 5 nations. The result, that is the comparison between the similarities of the power distance index is the criterion for the analyses of the learning by doing regional process. It demonstrates that the national perception of the power distance constitutes an incentive for independent business behavior and a high-performance orientation approach. This article argues in favor of the following: the presentation of the Nordic egalitarian management style, the analyses of power distance values, as well as the weight of the cultural compatibility in the learning by doing approach.

AB  - This article describes an open source web-based visualization tool for exploring stakeholder conflicts in land-use planning. It implements a multi-criteria, decision-analytic framework which solves a conflict-constrained knapsack problem in order to find Pareto efficient combinations of actions which maximize public value, given the conflict constraint. The user interface is centered around an interactive map in which geographical subareas are color-shaded in proportion to the mean strength of preference for a particular chosen action within the population in the selected area. The aim of this work is to investigate the use of web technologies and formal problem-solving methods for improving public participation in land-use planning and support local governments in the pursuit of improved decision-making. The tool was developed using the free statistical programming language R and the web application framework Shiny. Its usefulness is demonstrated through a case study in Upplands Vasby municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. The article ends with a summary together with some ideas for future research and development.

AB  - In northern Europe, the biologically rich European aspen (Populus tremula) tends to disappear both from intensively managed and strictly protected forests, thus representing a biodiversity conservation challenge. This study describes the distribution of Aphyllophoroid fungi inhabiting aspen in a hemiboreal mixed-forest landscape where clear-cutting was usually followed by natural regeneration. In a 4-km(2) area in Estonia, 181 individual forest stands and cut areas were surveyed. Sixty-one percent of the 2831 live aspen trees found were concentrated in 11% of the area. Thirty-six polypore species were recorded on aspen, with old stands and naturally created deadwood hosting most species. Among the records of 14 pre-defined aspen-specific basidiomycetes, Phellinus tremulae comprised about 95%. Six species (Ceriporiopsis aneirina, Clavicorona pyxidata, Funalia trogii, Phellinus populicola, Rigidoporus corticola, Steccherinum pseudozilingianum) were infrequent to rare, but widely distributed, inhabiting various stand-age classes, and mostly occurring outside "key habitats''. All the seven species absent are of conservation concern and frequent in Estonian old-growth forests. Thus, rotational management with natural aspen regeneration only provided habitat for some aspen-specific species. For sustaining all species, such landscapes should probably be complemented with stands managed using modified thinning and partial harvesting techniques in aspen-containing mixed stands.

AB  - Due to the expansion of nearby mining operations, the city of Kiruna, an arctic city in Sweden, has been undergoing a massive urban transformation, led by the mining company, Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB), which is the largest iron ore producer in the EU. This paper explores this relocation in a three-sphere transformation framework that has sustainability as the outcome (practical sphere), and analyses it as a socio-spatial transformation process, including political decisions as its driving forces (political sphere), to examine how this outcome and decisions represent individual and collective values (personal sphere). The analysis of three spheres is used as a tool to understand how and why Kiruna's urban transformation is deemed to be sustainable, as it claims, and which it is being globally acknowledged for. Methods include analysis of Kiruna's new master plan, media representations, and interviews with key actors of the project, who include municipal planners; the mining company's planning developers; consultants, as the designers of 'Kiruna 4-ever' and the new city center; as well as the city's residents. The analysis is a critique of the approaches that fit this project into either the critique of market-led spatial production, or as an example of best practice, based on its participatory processes. Results indicate that although Kiruna's relocation is claimed to be a transformation of collective values, practical and technical transformations were dominant, which represents only partial responses in the framework. Therefore, a multi-voice narrative challenges the sustainability of Kiruna's transformation.

AB  - Capsule: A description of the methods used for monitoring the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos in Norway
   Aims: To provide a comprehensive description of monitoring methods.
   Methods: The intensive monitoring of the Golden Eagle in Norway started in 1991 as part of a national monitoring programme initiated by the Directorate for Nature Management (now the Norwegian Environment Agency). It has since become part of the Norwegian Large Predator Programme, and Golden Eagles are currently being monitored in 12 separate areas. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the current methods used in the intensive monitoring, with definitions, fieldwork and evaluation criteria for the final breeding status. In addition, a description of estimation of annual adult survival by genetic analysis is given. We describe the current methodology used in the intensive part of the Golden Eagle monitoring in Norway.
   Results: We present some results derived from the Norwegian monitoring system and discuss the potential for further analyses. In addition, we highlight aspects in the monitoring of the Golden Eagles where our methods deviate slightly from those applied in other countries and the potential effects of these.
   Conclusions: Intensive long-term monitoring programmes, such as this, will become increasingly valuable for monitoring the impact of environmental change, both from natural phenomena and from anthropogenic activities. To facilitate comparisons among the Golden Eagle monitoring programmes, detailed knowledge about the various methods applied is important.

AB  - Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become a popular tool for governing rural development in a European context. PPPs are often presented as significant solutions for increasing both the effectiveness (problem-solving capacity) and the legitimacy of sustainable rural governance in terms of participation and accountability. In Sweden, where PPPs have played a marginal role, due to the EU cohesion policy they are now gaining ground as a model for the governance and management of natural resources in rural areas. Previous research shows that the state remains crucial in governing the process of governance through partnerships, especially in a rural as opposed to an urban context, where the state plays an ongoing role in initiating, structuring, financing and regulating partnerships. Is this an example of the state trying to counterbalance the increased power of the private sector, or the opposite that is, an attempt to reduce social exclusion and increase participation by promoting the interest of private actors in local development processes? Our study examines the critical role of the state in these partnerships. We focus on authorities in charge of natural resource management and rural development and assess the enabling role of the authorities in rural areas with a weak or dispersed private sector. Empirical data is collected via group interviews at a workshop in which key representatives from the authorities participated. We identify a number of potential challenges associated to PPPs in a rural context, and in light of this we clarify how the authorities engage in different types of partnership arrangements, as well as their capacity to facilitate these partnerships in attempt to enhance sustainable rural development.

AB  - Biological control of crop pests by naturally occurring arthropods depends on the entire community of natural enemies, but generalist predators and parasitoids are rarely considered in the same study. Also, the level of biological control in the field is affected by both within-field and landscape scale management. A multi-taxa approach that integrates multiple scales of management is needed to understand drivers for pest mortality. We examined local (weed cover and soil characteristics) and landscape (proportions of semi-natural and oilseed rape habitat) effects on natural enemy communities and biological control of pollen beetles in 15 oilseed rape (OSR) fields in Sweden. We found that agricultural intensification at the local (low weed cover) and landscape scale (low proportion of semi-natural area) increased evenness of generalist predators, but had no effect on the densities of pests and their natural enemies. This suggests that the generalist predators in OSR are well adapted to crop lands, at least within the examined gradient. Increasing OSR in the landscape decreased parasitoid densities and increased pest density, indicating a potential loss of pest control services by specialist natural enemies in landscapes with a high proportion of OSR. Finally, pollen beetle mortality increased with ground dwelling generalist predator abundance and soil clay content. Parasitism rates did not affect pest mortality, which is interesting as parasitoids have been considered major control agents in OSR. The hypothesis that increasing semi-natural habitat in the landscape enhances natural enemy abundances and species richness in agricultural landscapes was not supported. Local measures targeting generalist predators appear as a reasonable strategy to maximize pollen beetle control.

AB  - Algae-based biomass occupies a prominent role in policy narratives for a more sustainable future situated between Blue Growth Strategies and European (Blue) bioeconomy development. Especially in Norway, the developing seaweed farming sector is portrayed as a novel bioresource sector entailing an array of benefits to remediate global as local environmental and socio-economic challenges. Accredited with massive growth potentials and framed by large-scale industrialist rhetoric with a future in conquering ocean spaces through technological fixes, the sector's development faces multiple challenges. Additionally, the assumptive growth-centred policy narratives employed leave little room for small-scale, locally embedded alternatives called upon by many experts on sustainable and socially just blue resource governance. The paper addresses this issue by conceptualizing Norwegian seaweed farming as an assembling process with a focus on (policy) narratives as a means for governmental spatial interventions. Based on qualitative data with a focus on active Norwegian seaweed farmers' perspectives for the sector's current practices and future developments, the paper assesses the relations and contradictions between the optimistic key policy narratives, current sector developments, and the entrepreneur positionalities that shape the reproduction processes of this Norwegian seaweed assemblage. The paper shows that strong beliefs in extensive growth and technological solutions to tackle the fluid materialities of seaweed production are widespread among entrepreneurs. Paired with policy strategies and a development environment rooted in similar narratives, this creates a current development approach that reduces challenges to technological and administrative domains and neglects the (local) socio-economic and sustainability potential vested in alternative, small-scale approaches.

AB  - This article examines the strategic role played by private gardens in meeting societal challenges in urbanized environments in the late 19th-early 20th century. These gardens represented a means to provide food, a healthier living environment and, by implication, improved living conditions for the growing urban population. This strategic role was embedded in spatial and urban planning policies, as exemplified here in two case studies: the residential area Rostorp, Malmo (Sweden) and the region of Flanders (Belgium). With the case studies' results as starting point their historical narratives were written. These narratives were then confronted and the cases were qualitatively compared to demonstrate how, over time, the idea and materiality of the private garden have created value and meaning. These values include the strengthening of family values, establishing and maintaining social coherence, sense of place and identity, and creating social space which enabled an exchange of knowledge. We argue that these values have been gradually lost over the past half-century, particularly the understanding of private gardens as strategic spaces in which social challenges can be met. Due to lack of documentation, current knowledge of their meaning and heritage is poor. Their physical space is declining through urban densification. We add to the densification debate by arguing the potential for reinvigoration of the private garden and its values, to meet and plan for sustainable urban futures. Based on historical reflections and a presentation of the significance and meaning of private gardens in Belgium and Sweden, the main contributions of this article are general insights on the heritage and meaning of private gardens and a future outlook on the strategic role of private gardens in planning.

AB  - Urban sustainability transitions have attracted increasing academic interest. However, the political-institutional contexts, in which these urban sustainability transitions unfold and by which they are incited, shaped, or inhibited, have received much less attention. This is why we aim at extending previous studies of sustainability transitions by incorporating a multi-level governance perspective. While multi-level governance has been a long-standing theme in political science research, it has remained under-explored in the study of sustainability transitions. This claim is the starting point of our comparative analysis of urban sustainability transitions in Brighton (UK), Dresden (Germany), Genk (Belgium) and Stockholm (Sweden). Our approach "brings the politics back in" by elucidating the dynamics of power concentration and power dispersion generated by different national governance contexts. In our analysis, we explore which opportunities and obstacles these diverse governance contexts provide for urban sustainability transitions.

AB  - The prevalence of road traffic accidents is increasing towards endemic proportions in developing countries. The present study investigated cultural and demographic predictors of car accident involvement in a developed country in Europe and three developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The comparison was carried out with questionnaires among a randomly obtained representative sample of the Norwegian population (n = 247) as well as stratified samples in Accra and Cape-Coast in Ghana (n = 299), Dar-es-Salaam and Arusha areas in Tanzania (n = 599), and the central Kampala and the Mbarara district in Uganda (n = 415). Measurement instruments of culture as symbol exchange and destiny orientation were used to predict self-reported road traffic accident involvement by car among the respondents. Demographic characteristics, such as gender, age and education, were also included as predictors of car accidents. The results showed that male gender was the only significant predictor of accident involvement in Norway. Introverted and extroverted culture, destiny orientation and written culture were associated with accident involvement in the African countries. Male gender also predicted accidents in these countries. Non-technical injury preventive countermeasures in developing countries could focus on cultural practice and fatalistic beliefs. Countermeasures in both developed and developing countries should target male drivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability to predict nitrogen export from forested catchments is essential in order to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activities on the trophic status of lakes and sea areas, and to extrapolate the results to catchments from which no measurements are available. Data from 20 forested catchments (0.3-42 km(2)) in Finland and Sweden during the 10-year period 1979-88 were used to develop empirical multivariate regression models of average NO3-N, NH4-N and organic N export fluxes as a function of geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, deposition and forest management variables. A combination of high inorganic N deposition or air temperature and a low extent of organic soils was related to (R(2) = 0.64) high losses of NO3-N. A strong correlation between N deposition and air temperature makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of one variable from the other. Retention of deposited nitrogen is still high in most of the catchments. High losses of NH4-N had the strongest correlation with forestry activities and stream density. A combination of drainage percentage and temperature was related to (R(2) = 0.53) losses of NH4-N. The most important factors explaining spatial variability of organic N losses were clearly forestry activities. A combination of high percentage of drainage and clear-cutting was related to (R(2) = 0.81) high organic N losses. However, within the catchments, large-scale forest management practices were needed before any clear effect on spatial variability was detected. All the equations obtained were influenced by the choice of a limited number of catchments. No causal relationships between losses and the explaining variables can be inferred from this type of study.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables is the first step toward establishing sustainable freshwater ecosystems in terms of biodiversity, and this knowledge can be applied in river management. We analyzed major environmental variables that affect biotic communities on the national scale in the Republic of Korea. To achieve this goal, 2647 sampling stream sites were surveyed from 2016 to 2018 to collect benthic macroinvertebrates and measure 14 environmental variables. We identified a total of 359 taxa, belonging to 32 orders in 9 classes of 5 phyla, most of which were aquatic insects including Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Trichoptera. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on biotic communities divided the sampling sites into six groups. Discriminant analysis identified gradient, streambed substrates, velocity, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and altitude as the major environmental variables that distinguished each TWINSPAN group. In addition, stream order and stream width also influenced aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, but the influence was low. The indicator taxa in each group were gradually changed from sensitive organisms preferring high altitudes, fast velocities and coarse substrates to tolerant organisms preferring low altitudes, slow velocities and fine substrates in each group from one to six. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Republic of Korea was dependent on stream gradient, microhabitat, organic pollution and geographical feature rather than on stream size or other water quality variables. Our study identified variables affecting the overall distribution patterns of biotic communities on a national scale and provides useful information for conservation and management of stream ecosystems in the Asian monsoon region.

AB  - Natal dispersal affects the gene flow, distribution, dynamics and social structure of a population. In many solitary mammals, dispersal is often male-biased, while females may remain philopatric. For the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), dispersal distances vary greatly and may be explained by sex or by habitat characteristics, such as fragmentation. Juvenile lynx habitat selection during dispersal has not been studied before, but resident lynx select heterogeneous forested habitats and avoid human settlements and infrastructure through distinct temporal activity patterns. We studied movement patterns and habitat selection during the dispersal of 22 Eurasian lynx (7 females, 15 males) in Finland. We found no differences between the sexes in the onset age, duration, distance, route or route linearity. Dispersal took place mostly during the evening and at night but also during the day. Of the four most used habitats, the mixed forests and transitional woodlands were used more frequently than would be expected according to their availability, and conifer forests and fields less than would be expected. Housing and other human infrastructure, including roads, were the least frequently used categories. There was a highly significant difference between the used and available habitats in general. The lynx selected the habitat more carefully during the day than during the night.

AB  - A 590-cm sediment sequence from Lake Plaani was studied by pollen, loss-on-ignition and radiocarbon dating in order to reconstruct the vegetation and land-use history in the mosaic upland landscape of southern Estonia. Pollen analysis showed a sharp reduction of thermophilous tree species resulting from the cold event at around 8200 cal yr BP. The first signs of human impact are registered at the end of the Mesolithic period (c. 7700 cal yr BP) and are followed by evidence of forest clearance at the Neolithic/ Bronze Age transition (4000 cal yr BP), during which mostly broad-leaved trees suffered. The first occurrence of Cerealia pollen is dated to the Early Bronze Age (3500 call yr BP), indicating the beginning of farming in the surroundings. Intensive farming started at the end of the Middle Iron Age 1200 yr ago, as indicated by an increase of Cerealia and Cannabis-type pollen, being most pronounced around 500 cal BP.

AB  - Drained agricultural peatlands emit significantly higher amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per hectare than mineral soils. GHG abatement costs for representative cereals (CF) and dairy (DF) farms in southwestern Finland were estimated by integrating an emission-based tax together with an option to invest in a subsidized adjustable drainage system on peat soils in a farm-level dynamic optimization model. With an average 10% share of peat soils from overall farm area, emissions tax rates over 15 (CF) and 19 (DF) euro/tCO(2)e triggered adjustable drainage investments with a significant reduction in GHG emissions per ha, when assuming no crop-yield effect from the adjustable drainage. Abatement costs for emissions tax rates euro12-50/tCO(2)e/ha were euro16-44/tCO(2)e (CF) and euro26-51/tCO(2)e (DF) for whole farm-soil emissions, depending on the share of peatlands on the farm, on the yield effects of adjustable drainage, and on crop prices. High emissions tax rates imply higher abatement costs since farms have a limited capability to adjust their production and land use. Thus, emissions reductions from peatlands can be achieved at reasonable costs when investing in adjustable drainage on peatlands. The income losses due to emissions tax, however, are high, but they can be compensated for farmers by lumpsum payments independent of their production decisions. Since existing agricultural policies such as the EU CAP system may have limited effectiveness on GHG emissions, the emissions tax and adjustable drainage on peatlands could promote GHG abatement significantly on farms and areas with abundant peatlands.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-proxy approach to coastal Stone Age demography. It uses the district Hor-daland, western Norway as a case and applies the proxies SPD (summed probability distributions) of radiocarbon dates and stray find distributions. These are compared to pollen-based landscape re-constructions. Large numbers of Stone Age sites have been surveyed and excavated in western Norway during the last few decades, mainly because of modern development and cultural heritage management. This work has produced significant amounts of radiocarbon dates. The data has, until now, not been sufficiently organized and systematized for the purpose of doing research on long-term changes. The same is true for the many stray finds, which are stored at University Museum of Bergen. During the last decades, methodological development in palynology has made compilation of data and new vegetation reconstructions possible. For the first time, these dispersed datasets from the district Hordaland are brought together for comparative purposes, with a specific goal to study relative demographic changes. The hypothesis is that during the Stone Age, demographic change accompanied big cultural trans-formations in the transition from LM (late Mesolithic) to EN (early Neolithic) c. 5950 cal BP and between MN (middle Neolithic) and LN (late Neolithic) c. 4300 cal BP. This study partly supports the hypothesis, as the changes in the SPD and the stray finds during the transition to the late Neolithic clearly refiect marked population growth, related to the introduction of agriculture, at the same time as the pollen data reveal forest clearance. The LM-EN transition is less clearly connected to demographic change. Generally, up until the transition to the LN, the data indicate that there was gradual demographic growth with marked fiuctuations within a forested landscape. Although the proxies sometimes co-vary for the different periods, they may also display confiicting patterns, and this strengthens the argument that a multi-proxy approach to demographic studies is to be recommended.

AB  - A peat core from an ombrotrophic mire in central Sweden was analysed for multi-proxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, restate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition), to evaluate the relative contributions of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 350 years. C-14 wiggle-match daring was applied for high precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards, Changes in mire surface wetness were mainly caused by climate change (precipitation and evaporation), but the internal dynamics of the local bog vegetation may also have played a role in the recorded water table changes. The human impact signal in the pollen data was compared with Swedish population and land-use data. A link between climate change, human impact (openness of the vegetation) and demographic change was found. Cold and wet periods show a decrease in human impact and open land indicators in the pollen data, followed by an increase in death rate and/or an increase in emigration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examined the characteristics and performance of three different types of spatial objectives in multi-objective forest planning. These types were tested with a case study problem that aimed at improvements in the spatial pattern of the habitats of flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) and moose (Alces alces). In the first step, the habitats were determined by using a stand-level habitat suitability index (HSI). Stands in which the HSI exceeded a user-specified limit were considered as habitats. In the forest level problem formulations, the spatial objective types were included in the multi-objective forest-planning model, which was solved by using a heuristic optimization technique. The first type of spatial objective was the proportion of a specified type of stand boundary of the total boundary length. For flying squirrel, the aim was to increase the boundaries between neighboring stands, which were both suitable for breeding and foraging. For moose, the aim was to increase the amount of edge, i.e. the boundary between winter-foraging habitats and other areas. The second spatial objective type was the spatial autocorrelation of HSI. It was maximized for flying squirrel and minimized for moose. Whereas maximization of spatial autocorrelation tends to cluster similar stands, its minimization produces a pattern where neighboring stands often have different characteristics. The third spatial objective type was a weighted mean of the stand-level HSI. The weight depended on the stand location being highest for current habitat patches and decreased as the distance to them increased. This objective, which tends to cluster habitat patches, was applied to flying squirrel only. The spatial objective types were tested in six forest areas located in north Karelia, Finland, ranging from 404.6 to 984.8 ha in area. The first spatial objective resulted in a large area of habitat exceeding the threshold HSI value with a good spatial pattern. The second spatial objective yielded a clearly lower total habitat area but a good spatial pattern, and a good connectivity of the flying squirrels' habitats. The third objective resulted in a slightly improved spatial pattern of the flying squirrels' habitats. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Hornso-Allgunnen area in south-eastern Sweden has been known as a biodiversity hotspot for insects for about a century and is considered to host the most species-rich insect fauna in northern Europe. Several hypotheses for the causes behind this biodiversity have been put forward, but never tested for more than small parts of the area. We analyse here the possible role of the area's vegetation-cover history, in particular vegetation openness. We use pollen data from three sites in the Hornso-Allgunnen area and apply the recently developed Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) for quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation abundance at the local spatial scale. The study suggests that the area was dominated by diverse, relatively open forest during at least the last 3,000 years. Several tree taxa, such as Pinus, Betula and Quercus that were all suggested to be important for the present diversity, have a long continuity at the local spatial scale and were common until recently. Small proportions of anthropogenic pollen indicators were found, suggesting small-scale agriculture, which however did not considerably affect the area's overall tree species composition. We propose that fire was the main cause for the open character of the area's wooded landscape during the Holocene and, indirectly, an important agent behind the high insect diversity. However, the richness of insects was (and is) most likely also favoured by the long continuity of Quercus, and by the warm and dry local climate. The LRA provides a more realistic estimate of the taxa composition as compared to pollen percentages alone, both for arboreal and non-arboreal taxa. The differences between pollen percentages and LRA-estimates of plant abundance can be important to consider when causes behind high modern diversity are interpreted from fossil pollen records. Our results demonstrate the benefits of using the LRA along with traditional pollen percentages.

AB  - Anecdotal evidence suggests that harsh social conditions in the road haulage industry are having an impact on transport crime. This paper analyses transport crime, and demonstrates how to use a combination of official statistics and crowdsourced data in the process. A hierarchical regression analysis was applied to investigate the relations among different factors in order to predict transport crime threats. A secondary data set on transport crime from the Swedish Police was combined with primary crowdsourced data from volunteer observations of trucks in Sweden from both high-wage and low-wage countries. The findings imply that transportation is more vulnerable to antagonistic threats in geographical areas where the low-wage hauliers operate more frequently. For policymakers and practitioners, these findings provide useful guidance for the planning of security measures. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first exploratory study of its kind that uses a combination of official statistics and crowdsourced data.

AB  - The EU has developed a Directive on Sustainable Use of Chemical Pesticides (2009/128/EC) (SUD) that aims to enhance the use of non-chemical alternatives to pesticides like microbial plant protection products (PPP). The number of authorized microbial PPP for plant protection has increased globally during the last decade. There is, however, variation between different countries. Sweden and Denmark have for example each authorized 20 microbial PPP while Norway has only authorized four microbial PPP. Norway has also received significantly fewer applications for authorization of microbial PPP than the other Scandinavian countries. We explore possible explanations for the observed differences. Our results show that that the regulations in the three countries had similar requirements for the authorisation of microbial PPP. The size of the market is somewhat smaller in Norway than in Sweden and Denmark, and could therefore explain some of the differences. We suggest, however, that the most important explanation is implementation differences in terms of different decisions made in the authorization process. By comparing the authorization process for three microbial PPP in the Scandinavian countries, we found that Norway used more time for the product authorization decisions. Norway assess the same types of microbial PPP more restrictively with respect to environmental aspects and especially human health risks.

AB  - Preferential bus lanes are a widely use strategy to promote travelers to use public transport instead of private cars. Considering its relevance in the urban transportation planning and operation, it is crucial to evaluate them in terms of the operation and safety externality. We performed a road safety assessment in preferential public transport lanes with complex driving environment using a preventive approach on the 7th Avenue, in Bogota (Colombia), between 39th Street and 45th Street. A detailed study of traffic conflicts was carried out under the guidelines of the Swedish technique, which uses the Time to accident and Conflicting speed to establish the severity of a conflict. A traffic conflict is defined as an incident where, if two road users on collision course maintain their speed and trajectory constant, the crash between them will be imminent. With the field information, we calibrated a VISSIM microsimulation model that correctly replicates its traffic operation. Using the SSAM tool, we validated the base model to identify the simulated traffic conflicts in VISSIM and compared them with the observed conflicts. Under the calibrated environment, we developed and assessed three different scenarios of countermeasures to reduce the number of conflicts observed. As a result, we found that the safest scenario is the one established in the regulations that normalize the operation in preferential lanes, currently not obeyed by most users. Based on our results, we recommend an adjustment in the normative measures, including regulating the stopping time and stopping zones of private vehicles and taxis.

AB  - The constant expansion of urban habitats provides new opportunities for various wildlife species, referred to as urban exploiters or adapters that allow them to thrive in new conditions. The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) can adapt to and exploit urban ecosystems due to its omnivorous behaviour but the species expansion into this habitat can cause conflict with humans, and there is a paucity of data on badgers in urban habitats. The aim of our study was to explore trophic adaptations of badgers inhabiting urban and rural habitats in Norway. We examined 159 individual badgers by conducting detailed evaluation of allometric factors and trophic analyses of stomach contents. Mean body mass (+/- SE) of males (9.94 +/- 0.28 kg) was significantly heavier than females (9.02 +/- 0.32 kg). Mean body mass of rural versus urban badgers were not significantly different. However, body mass varied between seasons with an increasing trend throughout the year from spring (7.77 +/- 0.24 kg), summer (9.08 +/- 0.34 kg) and autumn (11.12 +/- 0.33 kg). We identified 12 unique food categories. There were no significant differences in badgers' diet with regard to sex or habitat type. However, the diet varied seasonally and was dominated by earthworms in spring, followed by insects, birds and small mammals in summer, and domestic plants (fruits and cereals) and anthropogenic food in autumn.

AB  - 1. Three permanent plots (100 x 0 m) were established in the subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest of Paneveggio in the spring of 1993, to begin a long-term forest ecosystem research project. The main purpose of these plots was to provide information about subalpine Norway spruce stand dynamics and to provide suggestions for close-to-nature silviculture.
   2. The three stands were selected to represent the most common forest structures in the Paneveggio forest. The first stand is close to forestry roads, has a relatively regular and continuous canopy, and thinning and cutting operations only ended in the 1980s: the second stand is Far from forest roads and has developed without anthropogenic influence for several decades: the third one is located at the present upper limit of the pure spruce forest and, apparently, was heavily used in the past as a pasture.
   3. The first step in the investigation was to describe the structure and to study the history of the three stands using both written evidence from management plans and biological archives from tree rings.
   4.The stands in plots 1 and 2 began to establish after a disturbance that removed part of the previous stands according to dendroecological studies, which are partially supported by written evidence. The remaining parts of these stands were eliminated by two major disturbances that occurred during the following decades. Written records about the use of the forest lead us to assume that the initial disturbances that occurred in the two stands were logging activities as a part of a group shelterwood system. The stand in plot 2 has developed without significant human interference for about half a century as confirmed by the presence of many dead trees. The stand in plot 3 consists of old trees that were part of an open stand and a secondary population that established after cessation of grazing.
   5. The study has confirmed that dendroecological techniques can be used to identify occurrence and intensity of previous disturbance in forests stands, although at Paneveggio it is difficult to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the tree ring record. The presence of human activity necessitates investigation of multiple lines of evidence.
   6. Paneveggio's forest management plans were useful in the interpretation of the data obtained through dendroecological analysis, although events did not always correspond because data from the management plans (yearly thinning, felling, wind-throw damage) never gave stand-level details, but applied to areas of several hectares. Despite these limitations. the information included in the management plans is of crucial importance in studying stand history and only by using all these sources of information is it possible to delineate the most important Features of the history and disturbance that affected the origin and subsequent growth of the forest stands.

AB  - Over the past decade, research on the impacts of climate change on immovable cultural heritage (ICH) in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctica) has slowly increased. This article offers a systematic review and synthesis of the publications about climate change impacts on the diverse ICH and climate change adaptation in the polar regions. Gray literature was not included in the study. Arctic countries like Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and Russia, and their associated research organizations, are under-represented in this literature when compared with the USA, Canada, Denmark, and Norway. More than half of the analyzed literature is published in the last 3 years (2019, 2020, and 2021) with a focus on coastal erosion and ICH degradation (cryospheric hazards). ICH is at risk from biological degradation, coastal erosion, debris flow, and thaw slumping. Nearly half of the studies report on the need for climate change adaptation planning and implementation for ICH. This study shows that advances in research on climate change impacts and adaptation responses are needed to improve decision- and policy-maker capacity to support effective adaptation policies and to contribute to the achievement of SDGs in polar regions. The polar regions' vulnerable landscapes and ICH sites can be used to communicate a larger message about the climate change challenges and adaptation measures.This article is categorized under:Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Observed Impacts of Climate ChangeVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and AnalogiesClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well-Being

AB  - Dead wood has been identified as a crucial component for forest biodiversity. Recent research has improved our understanding of habitat relations for many species associated with dead wood. However, the consequences for forest management are yet to be explored. In this review we build upon the growing volume of studies on dead wood dependent species, the dynamics of dead wood and ecological theory in order to identify the challenges for forest management at the landscape level. The review has a Fermoscandian focus, but the problems and challenges are similar in many forest ecosystems. We argue that it is necessary to 1) counteract the current shortage in availability of dead wood, 2) concentrate planning at the landscape level in order to minimize isolation and reduce edge effects, 3) create a variety of dead wood types, and 4) utilise available quantitative analytical tools. This calls for new approaches to management that to a large extent includes available knowledge, and to find platforms for planning forested landscapes with diverse holdings.

AB  - Water-related risks and vulnerabilities are driven by variety of stressors, including climate and land use change, as well as changes in socio-economic positions and political landscapes. Hence, water governance, which addresses risks and vulnerabilities, should target multiple stressors. We analyze the institutional perceptions of the drivers and strategies for managing water-related risks and vulnerabilities in three regionally important river basin areas located in Finland, Mexico, and Laos. Our analysis is based on data gathered through participatory workshops and complemented by qualitative content analysis of relevant policy documents. The identified drivers and proposed risk reduction strategies showed the multidimensionality and context-specificity of water-related risks and vulnerabilities across study areas. Most of the identified drivers were seen to increase risks, but some of the drivers were positive trends, and drivers also included also policy instruments that can both increase or decrease risks. Nevertheless, all perceived drivers were not addressed with suggested risk reduction strategies. In particular, most of the risk reduction strategies were incremental adjustments, although many of the drivers classified as most important were large-scale trends, such as climate change, land use changes and increase in foreign investments. We argue that there is a scale mismatch between the identified drivers and suggested strategies, which questions the opportunity to manage the drivers by single-scale incremental adjustments. Our study suggests that for more sustainable risk and vulnerability reduction, the root causes of water-related risks and vulnerabilities should be addressed through adaptive multi scale governance that carefully considers the context-specificity and the multidimensionality of the associated drivers and stressors.

AB  - Background There is virtually no readily accessible systematically recorded evidence on how the organization of mental health services in Europe's largest country, Russia, may differ from other national systems. This study systematically compares the mental health services in Archangelsk County and Northern Norway using instruments developed for trans-cultural use. Methods The European Service Mapping Schedule (ESMS) and The International Classification of Mental Health Care (ICMHC) were used to describe: (i) resources, organisation and utilisation of the services; (ii) their decentralisation and differentiation; (iii) some interventions delivered by the mental health service units (n = 132) in both regions. Results The Norwegian services are more decentralised and differentiated, while the Russian services are largely hospital-based. The GPs are of considerable importance to the Norwegian services, functioning as gatekeepers-both centrally and peripherally. In contrast, the GP model is still poorly established in Archangelsk County. There are more units for long term stay in the Russian services than in Norway. General health care and taking over daily living activities are more organised in Archangelsk County, while psychopharmacological treatment and psychosocial interventions are more developed in Norway. Conclusion The study has revealed several differences in resources, organisation and utilisation of the mental health services between the two compared areas. The very large variations indicate that underlying local patterns of service delivering must be further investigated and taken into account in the planning of the services development.

AB  - Clayey soils with a cryic soil temperature regime and an aquic soil moisture regime are extensive in southern Finland but they have rarely been pedogenically described. A pedon in a field that has been in agricultural use since the 17th century was characterized and features indicative of human-influenced pedogenic processes were identified. Owing to intensified agriculture, the soil has become drier than ever before. Natural shrink-swell and anthropogenic turbation processes had destroyed the rock structure to a depth of 72 cm. Groundwater monitoring during nine years proved that in several years the soil had a chance to desiccate down to 150 cm, resulting in wedge-shaped prisms and desiccation joint planes. The cracks and root channels serve as routes for clay translocation. IIluvial clay, observed in thin sections, had the maxima (> 1%) in the Btg (38-72 cm) and BCtg2 (112-140 cm) horizons, corresponding to the effective drainage depths during ditch drainage until 70 years ago and subsequent subsurface tile drainage, respectively. Seventy years of improved drainage seems to be sufficient to give rise to an argic/argillic horizon. This feature is likely man-made but, being irreversible, it must be taken into account in soil classification. In this climate, agriculture seems to influence pedogenesis strongly throughout the solum far below the Plough layer. Luvisols (WRB) or Cryaqualfs (Soil Taxonomy) have not been documented in a clay soil in Finland or Sweden before.

AB  - The article presents the findings of a long-term incorporated comparison of forestry capitalism's globalization process. Primary data was collected by participant observation in pulp investment areas in Brazil between 2004 and 2011 and semi-structured interviews with key industry personnel, particularly in Finland. It is argued that the key cyclic change in industrial forestry from innovation-capitalization to material-territorial accumulation explains why and how the industry has globalized to the south via industrial tree plantations. The interlinked northern (Finnish) and southern (Brazilian) cases reveal that industry trajectories are influenced by who controls the supply chains of commodities. The findings are relevant for theorizing about the globalization of natural resource exploitation sectors. Changes in agrarian political economies and agency of state, business, and social movement actors-that is, socio-ecological relations and landscapes-help to explain how and why national and global capitalism and its developmental-environmental impacts are transformed.

AB  - The governance of shared waters involves complex interactions between actors and institutions embedded in different legislative approaches, cultures and administrative procedures. Marine Spatial Planning can address the transboundary dimension of marine governance, based on its potential to foster integration between sectoral agencies, regulatory bodies and local stakeholders when making decisions about the distribution of coastal and maritime uses. Coordination between activities and practices of actors in planning transboundary areas is imperative in advancing sustainability. This paper seeks to make a contribution to the evolving field of MSP by expanding the dimensions of integration in MSP to consider institutional integration. In doing so, the paper reviews pivotal literature on MSP and makes an argument that existing studies on integration in MSP are structured in an inductive manner and focused on national and sea-basin cases. In response to addressing these gaps, we used the social systems theory and related theories, as an overarching and valuable lens to understand the institutional challenges of planning across maritime borders. Based on these lenses, we present an evaluation framework that uses the metaphor of a 'wheel' to indicate iterative stages (observation, initial impact, response, recovery and stabilisation) that are shaped by dimensions including structural alignment, self-oriented action, and collaborative capacity. This is followed by discussion about the potential application and next steps for enhancing the utility of the framework. In conclusion, the paper adds to the growing discourse on transboundary MSP by presenting a deductive framework that can be applied to different context and multi-governance levels to understand institutional integration.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is rapidly becoming one of the main threats to biodiversity, along with other threats triggered by human-driven land-use change. Species are already responding to climate change by shifting their distributions polewards. This shift may create a spatial mismatch between dynamic species distributions and static protected areas (PAs). As protected areas represent one of the main pillars for preserving biodiversity today and in the future, it is important to assess their contribution in sheltering the biodiversity communities, they were designated to protect. A recent development to investigate climate-driven impacts on biological communities is represented by the community temperature index (CTI). CTI provides a measure of the relative temperature average of a community in a specific assemblage. CTI value will be higher for assemblages dominated by warm species compared with those dominated by cold-dwelling species. We here model changes in the CTI of Finnish bird assemblages, as well as changes in species densities, within and outside of PAs during the past four decades in a large boreal landscape under rapid change. We show that CTI has markedly increased over time across Finland, with this change being similar within and outside PAs and five to seven times slower than the temperature increase. Moreover, CTI has been constantly lower within than outside of PAs, and PAs still support communities, which show colder thermal index than those outside of PAs in the 1970s and 1980s. This result can be explained by the higher relative density of northern species within PAs than outside. Overall, our results provide some, albeit inconclusive, evidence that PAs may play a role in supporting the community of northern species. Results also suggest that communities are, however, shifting rapidly, both inside and outside of PAs, highlighting the need for adjusting conservation measures before it is too late.

AB  - Translocations have been advocated as a conservation tool helping species adapt to climate and land-use change, but well-documented examples of invertebrates' translocations are rare. The paper describes a successful translocation of the threatened Clouded Apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne) in Finland, compares this to a specific failed translocation, and presents conclusions for conservation planning as to factors contributing to the success. Two apparent key characteristics of the successful translocation were greater abundance of larval resources and less open landscape. The successful site was surrounded by forest, which strongly restricted emigration, crucially supporting the survival of the small initial population. Based on 20 mated females' translocation in 2000, the local population increased slowly, reaching 600 butterflies in 2011. A large translocation patch together with host-plant abundance enabled successful establishment of the local population. Availability of other suitable grassland patches sufficiently nearby was an additional key characteristic, facilitating the Clouded Apollo's expansion. However, the expansion rate was low; it took seven years for the butterflies to colonise the five nearest patches, only 10-200 m from the translocation patch. By 2013, they had colonised all suitable semi-natural grassland patches within 2 km from the translocation site and established a seemingly viable metapopulation with 11 subpopulations. The results point to the significance of local habitat area and landscape quality, along with conditions restricting emigration, in determination, of suitable translocation sites.

AB  - The effects of different land use types on nutrient and chemical run-off have been widely researched, but the total effect of change in land use on the aquatic species community is not well-known. For this study we researched the effect of land use change on the vascular plant communities in lakes. The study was conducted with aerial photographs and GIS-techniques in the countryside of central Finland. We compared the change in vascular plant species community structure with the change in land use around 25 lakes, between the years 1933-1934 and 1996. The change in land use was analyzed in two different riparian zones. We found several indications of links between changes in land use and aquatic vascular plant species. According to our data a decrease in agricultural land use, in particular fields and meadows, appears to influence species turnover and increases the number of new vascular plant species. When the changes in fields and meadows were added together and compared to the change in species turnover, the correlation was even more evident. Changes in land use types in a zone 0-100 m from the lake shoreline correlated with a change in vascular plant species more often than changes in a larger, adjacent zone, 100-400 m from the shore. This indicates that changes in the few hundred meters nearest the lake have the most elemental consequences for aquatic vascular plant species, giving an indication of the breadth of the protection zones needed between freshwaters and agricultural lands.

AB  - One thousand years of mining of sulfurous ores at the Falun copper mine, central Sweden, and the resulting atmospheric emissions of metals and sulfur dioxide, gives a unique opportunity to study long-term responses to acid deposition. Copper production peaked in the 17(th) century, when Falun supplied 2/3 of the world's copper production. Thereafter production and associated emissions have declined, and the mine was closed in the 1990's. Sediment cores from 14 lakes situated between 3-27 km from the mine have been analyzed for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, S and Pb-206/Pb-207 isotope ratios to study the historical and geographical distribution of airborne pollutants. Diatoms have been analyzed to infer past lake acidity and to assess whether lake acidification has occurred and, if so, whether any recovery from acidification has occurred following the reduction in sulfur emissions. Eight of the fourteen lakes have acidified, beginning as early as the late 17(t)h century, when the estimated annual emissions of SO2 amounted to 40,000 tons. This is perhaps the earliest known record of anthropogenic lake acidification. Despite the large historical deposition of sulfur, the pH has only decreased by 0.4-0.8 units, with the lowest diatom-inferred pH being 5.8. Effects of agriculture and forestry following the expanding mining industry may have counteracted acidification. Despite the 300 yrs of lowered emissions the diatom record shows no recovery in pH. There are still large amounts of sulfur accumulated in the soils in the area that may delay recovery from lake acidification. Afforestation in the area over the last 100 yrs may also play an important role in delaying the recovery process.

AB  - Higher nest predation at habitat edges is a major problem for conservation biology. We studied nest predation using artificial nests resembling great reed warblers' nests at edges and interiors of reedbeds in four large wetlands in Europe: Lake Homborga (Sweden), Lake Neusiedl (Austria), Lake Velence (Central-Hungary) and Kis-Balaton marshland (West-Hungary). Nest losses showed great local and temporal variation, and in general there was larger nest predation at the edges than in the interior reedbeds. Predation rates of artificial nests along different reedbed edges showed great variation. In contrast, predation rates of interiors were more similar across all experiments, with less variation. This may indicate the existence of a habitat-specific predation rate with less variation in interiors of large habitats, while edges are more exposed to the influences of other factors, which resulted in higher variation of predation rates among study sites. Therefore, reedbed conservation should prefer large stands if considering only passerine nest predation, because (1) nest survival seems to be higher in interior than at edges, and (2) because interiors are less variable, i.e. more stable than edges. The designation of reedbeds cannot rely on reedbed edges, where predation can change due to factors not related to the reed habitat at all.

AB  - This article examines the transfer of technology from Finnish enterprises to Soviet industry during the USSR's period of technological modernization between 1955 and 1964. It centers on the forestry sector, which was a particular focus of modernization programs and a key area for the transfer of foreign techniques and expertise. The aim of the article is to investigate the role of trips made by Soviet specialists to foreign (primarily Finnish) enterprises in order to illustrate the nontechnological influences that occurred during the transfer of technologies across the cold war border. To do so, the article is divided into two parts: the first presents a general analysis of technology transfer from a micro-level perspective, while the second investigates the cultural influences behind technological transfer in the Soviet-Finnish case. This study contends that although the Soviet government expected its specialists to import advanced foreign technical experience, they brought not only the technologies and expertise needed for modernizing the industry, but also a changed view on Soviet workplace management and everyday practices.

AB  - Global megatrends such as scarcity of natural resources and urbanization have been the drivers for a mining sector upswing. Therefore, the mining sector in Finland, with attractive ore geology, has recently experienced rapid growth and new mines have been opened. At the same time, society's expectations have increased, resulting in a public debate on mining companies' environmental and social responsibility. Companies have the same positioning choices relative to their competitors, but environmental issues are a new area of interest in order to stand out strategically. In this study of companies with mining operations in Finland, strategic environmental management practices are examined based on companies' own public information. This article takes a closer look at whether their public reporting projects an image of strategic environmental management. The results show that environmental and social considerations are essential elements in companies' commitments and strengthen their business strategy. This study also shows a gap between strategic commitments and their implementation, based on the company reports. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gray wolf Canis lupus predation on domestic dogs Canis familiaris is a considerable wolf-human conflict issue in several regions of Europe and North America but it has not been well documented in the scientific literature. Livestock depredations by wolves may be related to the abundance of wild prey. Regardless of the presumed motivations of wolves for attacking dogs (likely due to interference competition and predation), the abundance of wild prey populations may also influence the risk of wolf attacks on dogs. We examined whether the annual number of fatal attacks by wolves on dogs was related to the abundance of primary prey, including wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Estonia, as well as the abundance of moose Alces alces in Finland. Statistical models resulted in significant negative relationships, thus providing evidence that the risk of attacks in both house yards (Estonia) and hunting situations (Finland) was highest when the density of wild prey was low. Wild ungulates cause damage to agriculture and forestry, but they seem to mitigate conflicts between wolves and humans; therefore, it is necessary to develop a holistic, multispecies management approach in which the importance of wild ungulates for large carnivore conservation is addressed.

AB  - In accordance with the bulk of published studies it seems widely accepted that energy productivity in modern intensive agriculture is decreasing and that primary emphasis should be on decreasing the use of fossil energy. A comprehensive comparison of three development stages in the transition of conventional Swedish agriculture (from 1956 to 1993) indicates that such conclusions should be questioned.
   This study of Swedish agriculture suggests that the potential of conventional agriculture to bind solar energy creates a much larger effect on energy flows than savings on inputs. It is also suggested that earlier studies of energy in agriculture have not only taken an inappropriate account of technological development but also miscalculated the links between used technology and the possibilities of energy crops. The fact that high input agriculture requires much less land per unit of output is taken as a basis for using the opportunity cost principles of economics to re-evaluate the energy and environmental performance of high input agriculture.
   The present study illustrates how both energy productivity and potentials for a better consideration of important environmental factors of a technological agriculture may be underestimated. The biggest challenge seems to be to aim for a better understanding of further developments of a technological agriculture for food production considering the environment, the use of 'surplus' land for energy crops and schemes for increased biodiversity. The results of this study should mainly be relevant for parts of agriculture in Europe and North America. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) is applied to a large and a small lake to convert pollen percentages from the small lake into estimated local vegetation cover in selected time periods starting from 2800 cal BC (Middle Neolithic A). This reconstruction shows that estimated forest cover has fluctuated through time, and changes in openness related to human impact are distinct from the Early Bronze Age (1800-1200 cal BC). Pollen analyses from the soil profile indicate forest clearances from the Late Neolithic (2300-1800 cal BC). Gradual intensification of farming is recognized in both pollen diagrams throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages with increasing openness and spatial differentiation in land-use practices. Presence of pollen of cereals and flax record the cultivation of these plants from the Iron Age, and intensification of land-use may have caused erosion and re-sedimentation in the lake in medieval times. To identify a possible landscape in the past, HUMPOL software has been used with the Late Neolithic as a case study. The LRA-based estimates of forest cover are supported by the HUMPOL simulations, but several solutions to the Late Neolithic landscape pattern exist. The results clearly demonstrate how implementation of LRA and HUMPOL improve the understanding of cultural landscape development.

AB  - Public transport is one of the main infrastructures of a sustainable city. For this reason, there are many studies on public transportation which mostly answer the question of "when my next bus will arrive?". However now when the public is under the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic and learning to live with new social rules such as "social distance" a new yet crucial question arise on public transportation: "how crowded my next bus will be?" To prevent the crowdedness in public transportation the traffic regulators need to forecast the number of passengers the day ahead. In this study, in cooperation with Synteda, we suggest a machine learning algorithm that forecasts the occupancy in a bus or tram the day ahead for each stop for a route. The input data is past passenger travel data provided by the Vasttrafik AB which is the public transportation company in Gothenburg, Sweden. The hourly data for the precipitation and temperature also has been added to the forecasting method; the database of precipitation and temperature is obtained by the SMHI, Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.

AB  - Tourism is viewed in many industrial nations as an environmentally friendly way to revitalize distressed rural economies and communities. In the forest regions of Dalarna and interior Maine: hopes are pinned on nature-based tourism, with the presumption that natural capital is underutilized. This paper explores the potential and pitfalls of nature tourism as a basis for sustainable rural development in regions where most land is held privately but quasi-open access for recreation has been either a right (Dalarna) or a customary entitlement (Maine). The paper applies theories of common pool resources and impure public goods to show that both property regimes are mal-adapted for sustainable nature tourism. Limited exclusion combined with rivalness in land uses mis-aligns incentives facing landowners, tourists, and recreation businesses. Short-term effects include congestion, reduced economic opportunity, and depressed production of non-recreational goods. Longer-term effects include environmental degradation and weak incentives for value-added investment. Tourism development is further impeded by a scale mis-match between small ownerships and large efficient recreation management units. The analysis suggests that sustainable nature tourism faces four land use challenges. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Compliance is a precondition for a regulatory system to be effective. This article analyses the drivers behind non-compliance and ways of enhancing compliance by empirically investigating the assumptions of compliance theories in the regulation of biodiversity conservation in private forests in Finland. The article shows that institutional factors, such as the characteristics of the decision-making procedure and the roles professional forest organisations, as well as market pressure on large corporate actors, explain to a large extent the identified low level of non-compliance. Knowledge, information and coordination are identified as the most important bottlenecks in the enhancing the implementation of regulation on habitat conservation. We propose the following combination for the promotion of compliance: building on a cooperative strategy by improving the knowledge base and sharing; following a responsive regulation strategy by maintaining existing deterrence tools; and applying true smart regulation through more ambitious institutional arrangements for engagement with new third parties.

AB  - National reserve networks are one of the most important means of species conservation, but their efficiency may be diminished due to the projected climatic changes. Using bioclimatic envelope models and spatial data on habitats and conservation areas, we studied how efficient the reserve network will be in preserving 100 forest, mire, marshland, and alpine bird species of conservation concern in Finland in 2051-2080 under three different climate scenarios. The occurrences of the studied bird species were related to the amount of habitat preferred by each species in the different boreal zones. We employed a novel integrated habitat suitability index that takes into account both the species' probability of occurrence from the bioclimatic models and the availability of suitable habitat. Using this suitability index, the distribution of the topmost 5% suitability squares ("hotspots'') in the four bird species groups in the period 1971-2000 and under the three scenarios were compared with the location of reserves with the highest amounts of the four habitats to study the efficiency of the network. In species of mires, marshlands, and Arctic mountains, a high proportion of protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots in the scenarios in 2051-2080, showing that protected areas cover a high proportion of occurrences of bird species. In contrast, in forests in the southern and middle boreal zones, only a small proportion of the protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots, indicating that the efficiency of the protected area network will be insufficient for forest birds in the future. In the northern boreal zone, the efficiency of the reserve network in forests was highly dependent on the strength of climate change varying between the scenarios. Overall, there is no single solution to preserving biodiversity in a changing climate, but several future pathways should be considered.

AB  - 1. The widespread declines of farmland birds have generally been linked to agricultural intensification. We tested the hypotheses that (i) changes in agricultural policy, through its effects on agricultural intensification and (ii) regional differences in agricultural intensification affect temporal and spatial population trends of farmland birds in Sweden.
   2. We analysed regional bird population trends (1976-2003) for seven common farmland bird species: the migratory lapwing Vanellus vanellus, skylark Alauda arvensis, starling Sturnus vulgaris and linnet Carduelis cannabina and the resident tree sparrow Passer montanus, house sparrow P. domesticus and yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. We identified three periods of agricultural policy in Sweden between 1976 and 2003: the intensification period (i.e. 1976-87; promoting increased production), the set-aside period (1987-95; promoting extensification of farming) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) period (1995-2003; promoting increased production). Population trends were compared between three types of Swedish farmlands: open plains (intensive farming with a marked intensification), mosaic farmlands (i.e. farmland-dominated forest mosaics, less intensive farming, but show moderate intensification) and forest regions (i.e. forest-dominated farmlands with low intensity farming and extensification/abandonment).
   3. The four migrants displayed clear significant trend switches between the policy periods, with declines in the 'intensification period' and the 'CAP period' and less negative or even positive population trends in the 'set-aside period'. The population trends of the three resident species showed no clear pattern in relation to agricultural policy periods.
   4. All species except tree sparrow displayed significantly different population trends between farmland regions. Four species (lapwing, skylark, linnet and house sparrow) declined most in the open plains and the forest regions, whereas two species (starling and yellowhammer) declined most in the mosaic farmlands.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Large-scale changes in agriculture policy have a strong potential to change the present poor state of farmland biodiversity as shown by the generally positive population trends in the 'set-aside period'. It also suggests extensification to be beneficial to farmland birds. However, in regions of low profitability and an already ongoing extensification, a further extensification will lead to loss of both farmland habitat and bird diversity. In such regions mixed farming needs to be retained and hence should be supported.

AB  - "The rate of building renovation needs to be increased, as the existing building stock represents the single biggest potential sector for energy savings. Moreover, buildings are crucial to achieving the Union objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990" according to Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, 2012. We have international objectives in Europe today, but not international regulations. Among other things, minimum energy requirements are defined at the national level and they are often not clear in case of existing buildings, including heritage buildings. The existing building stock in Norway has a great potential. Most of the buildings expected to be used in 2050, around 70-80%, are already built. A large part of them represents older buildings with a high value of cultural heritage. The use and re-use of them instead of demolition should be considered as important environmental protection. The current regulations in the Norwegian Planning and Building Act of 2010, PBL10/TEK17, are formulated for all buildings, including existing buildings. In general, in the event of modernization of any existing building, the investor must apply for an exception if the building does not meet the current requirements. Therefore, demolition is often preferred due to the lack of clear retrofitting regulations and requirements as well as uncertainty in terms of profitability for investors. However, buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage are protected by the Cultural Heritage Act of 1979, Kulturminneloven, before they meet the requirements set out in the Norwegian Planning and Building Act. This means that demolition or any changes to these buildings are not allowed or very difficult to carry out. In practice, revitalization of these heritage buildings, including upgrading them to current minimum energy requirements or higher energy standards, is a challenge. Can we effectively protect them without interrupting their revitalization? In this article, the current status of regulations and requirements for existing buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage protected by the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway, Riksantikvaren, are analyzed. Conflicts and gaps in the current regulations, as well as ownership-related challenges that stop revitalization projects, are mapped. Today, the revitalization of protected buildings in Norway is challenging. Upgrading existing buildings and protecting buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage requires clear and separate regulations, requirements and guidelines that take into account to specific situation of protected buildings and cultural landscape that they create, and we can enjoy today, to preserve these unique values for future generations.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are crucial in conserving biodiversity under climate change. In boreal regions, trends of biologically relevant climate variables (i.e., bioclimate) in PAs have remained unquantified. We investigated the changes and variability of 11 key bioclimatic variables across Finland during the period 1961-2020 based on gridded climatology. Our results suggest significant changes in annual mean and growing season temperatures over the entire study area, whereas, e.g., annual precipitation sum and April-September water balance have increased especially in the central and northern parts of Finland. We found substantial variation in bioclimatic changes over the 631 studied PAs; in the northern boreal zone (NB) the number of snow-covered days has decreased on average by 5.9 days between 1961-1990 and 1991-2020, while in the southern boreal zone (SB) the corresponding decrease has been 16.1 days. The number of frost days in spring with absent snow cover has decreased in the NB (on average -0.9 days) while increasing in the SB (0.5 days), reflecting the changing exposure of biota to frost. The observed increases in accumulation of heat in the SB and more frequent rain-on-snow events in the NB can affect drought tolerance and winter survival of species, respectively. Principal component analysis suggested that the main dimensions of bioclimate change in PAs vary across vegetation zones; for example, in the SB the changes are related to annual and growing season temperatures, whereas in the middle boreal zone the changes are linked to altered moisture and snow conditions. Our results highlight the substantial spatial variation in bioclimatic trends and climate vulnerability across the PAs and vegetation zones. These findings provide a basis for the understanding of the multifaceted changes the boreal PA network is facing and help to develop and direct conservation and management.

AB  - We address a new agricultural policy concern following the decoupling of CAP direct payments in 2005: passive farming, whereby landowners maintain their agricultural area to collect payments without producing commodities. It is claimed that passive farming is hindering agricultural development by 'blocking' access to farmland for expanding farmers. We evaluate the links between the EU's Single Payment Scheme (SPS), passive farming, land use and agricultural development. Following identification of the rational landowners' optimal land-use choice, we evaluate the effects of the SPS using a spatial, agent-based model that simulates farmers' competition for land in a case-study region of Sweden. We show that passive farming does not constrain land from being used in production; on the contrary more land is used than would be the case without the SPS. We conclude that passive farming is not a problem for agriculture, but provides public goods that would otherwise be under provided: preservation of marginal farmland and future food security. However SPS payments on highly productive land inflate land values (capitalisation) and slow structural change, which hinder agricultural development. Consequently CAP goals could be better served by targeting payments on marginal land and phasing out payments to highly productive land.

AB  - Legislative changes have greatly altered waste management in Finland. The adoption of the EC waste policies in particular has created a pressure to dispose less waste on landfills and increase the sustainable use and recycling of natural resources. Implementation of new policies has created a need to improve the existing landfilling practices and recycling on landfills, and to increase the knowledge about landfills in general. This is likely to have affected the course of landfill-related research in Finland. In this study, we investigate the development of Finnish landfill research by studying the trends in the number and the focus of publications on landfill research. The impacts of legislative changes and EC policies on research activities were examined. Additionally, we reviewed the publication of research results within and outside of the scientific community and studied the development of public interest in landfills. We show that legislative changes have affected both the activity and themes of the Finnish landfill research. Waste management professionals in particular are now paying more attention to landfill questions in Finland. The study also shows that publication of Finnish research papers in international scientific media has increased during the recent years. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mention of Finland, like many other northern European countries, is largely absent from discussions of the global trafficking of cultural objects. However, its proximity to the Russian Federation (historically a source of looted objects such as Orthodox icons and other religious art), as well as its apparent attractiveness as a route of transit, at least for the legal market in cultural objects, suggest that focus on Finland would be a valuable exercise in understanding the wider transnational movement of cultural objects, within the Baltic and Nordic regions and beyond. Indeed, the lack of any import regulation for cultural objects entering Finland, along with its pivotal role as a 'hard border' nation of the European Union and Schengen Area, suggest an 'invisible' problem, as yet under-researched and under-recorded. This paper aims to initiate discussion of the roles of seemingly unassuming nations within the backdrop of a regional and international context.

AB  - Natural habitats are lost and fragmented by urbanization globally, resulting in isolated urban remnants of low biodiversity, devoid of specialist species. This homogenization of the urban landscape can be redressed if urban biodiversity hotspots are identified and conserved. Mires have the potential of being such refuges, since they host many mire specialist species of, e.g. arthropods. Here we investigated twenty pine mires that differed in urbanization level (low, intermediate and high) in southern Finland by evaluating the responses of carabid beetle and spider species and communities to potential landscape (level of urbanization, total mire area) and local (pH of peat, vegetation cover, wood volume) drivers. Pitfall trapping was used to collect the arthropods. We showed that high levels of urbanization have a negative effect on mire arthropod biodiversity. However, urban mire community structure seems not to be very different from rural communities as urban mires are still inhabited by mire specialists. Furthermore, tree-covered parts of urbanized mires can serve as refuges for rare forest specialist species and Sphagnum mosses play an important role in supporting mire species and communities, thus Sphagnum growth should be promoted. We showed that urban mires can be considered urban biodiversity hotspots and their protection should be secured in urban development.

AB  - This study addresses a possible mismatch between political rhetoric on creative industries and tourism relations and the experiences and expectations that artists and workers in the creative industries have of their artistic work and their sector. In semi-structured interviews, we asked if and then how creatives and developers in Norway relate to the concept of tourism and whether they see tourists or the tourism industry as a target market for cultural products. Our findings suggest that developers are likely, but creatives unlikely to see a relation between creative's work and tourism or tourists, and the tourism industry as a target market for cultural products. Tourism is in other words a blind spot in the business practices of creative entrepreneurs.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide vital ecosystem functions and services, but have been rapidly degrading due to human impacts. Restoration is increasingly considered key to reversing these losses, but is often unsuccessful. Recent work on seagrasses and salt marsh cordgrasses highlights that restoration yields can be greatly enhanced by temporarily mimicking key emergent traits. These traits are not expressed by individual seedlings or small clones, but emerge in clumped individuals or large clones to locally suppress environmental stress, causing establishment thresholds where such density-dependent self-facilitation is important for persistence. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the efficacy of restoration via emergent trait-based mimicry depends on the intensity of stressors. We test this in a restoration experiment with the temperate seagrass Zostera marina at four sites (Finland, Sweden, UK, USA) with contrasting hydrodynamic regimes, where we simulated dense roots mats or vegetation canopies with biodegradable structural mimics. Results show that by mimicking sedimentstabilizing root mats, seagrass transplant survival, growth and expansion was strongly enhanced in hydrodynamically exposed environments. However, these positive effects decreased and turned negative under benign conditions, while mimics insufficiently mitigated physical stress in extremely exposed environments, illustrating upper and lower limits of the application. Furthermore, we found that aboveground structures, designed to mimic stiff rather than flexible vegetation canopies, underperformed compared to belowground mimics. Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the conditions at the restoration site, species-specific growth requirements, and self-facilitating traits that organisms may express when applying emergent traitmimicry as a tool to improve restoration success.

AB  - Forest history is one of the bases by which biodiversity in woodlands can be explained. In practice, forest history is mainly investigated in relation to research about ancient woodlands, or to particular scientific questions. However, it seems necessary to assess forest history not only for specific occasions but to take it as a base for an evaluation of the naturalness of any particular forest. Naturalness is a widely used criterion for evaluating the current state of a forest in relation to specific nature conservation values. It refers to the actual composition of the vegetation, neglecting any historical processes. To assess naturalness within a dynamic concept means to display a set of criteria that reflect the individual historical development of a forest. This has to include certain key processes, such as the competition, ageing and dying, but also a set of criteria characterizing the human interference during all the reconstructable past.

AB  - The paper explores barriers for designing and implementing policies for the transition to more environmentally sustainable urban mobility, and strategies for overcoming these barriers in three Norwegian cities. Empirical data has been collected by interviewing key informants and analysing relevant documents. The findings show that there is broad political support for placing sustainable mobility high on the political agenda. Challenges appear when policy measures are designed and implemented. Cultural, legal, political, organisational, financial and knowledge-related barriers are identified. Many similar barriers are identified in the three case cities, but differences also appear. The results indicate that the size of the cities as well as the type of policy packages implemented are important factors, impacting both the type and strength of barriers. Several strategies for overcoming barriers have been implemented in the three case cities with success. The implementation of policy packages with a combination of "push" and "pull" measures is perhaps the most important strategy. In addition, using communication strategically and allowing for trials and step-by-step introduction of policy measures are success factors. Better methods for stakeholder involvement and planning tools for bicyclists and pedestrians may increase the acceptance of policy measures and speed up the transition toward sustainable mobility.

   The effect of mature forest fragmentation on breeding success of vole-eating Tengmalm's owls Aegolius funereus was studied in western Finland during 1981-1995. The owl pairs produced more fledglings in territories with high (>30%) proportions of clear-cut and plantation areas than in territories with low (<30%) proportions of such areas. Territory occupancy, clutch size, laying date, and parental characteristics such as wing length, body mass and age were not associated with the proportion of clear-cut areas within territories. Snap-trapping data from the 'increase' vole year 1994 revealed that the Microtus vole density tended to be higher in large clear-cuttings than in small ones. The increasing amount of sapling and clear-cut areas in coniferous forests during the last three decades has created suitable grass habitats for Microtus voles, and simultaneously new hunting habitats for Tengmalm's owls. Therefore, forest fragmentation due to clear-cuttings may benefit Tengmalm's owls at the present scale. However, nest-boxes should be erected and old groves should be protected, because forest harvesting apparently reduces the number of suitable natural cavities for owls in the long run.

AB  - Butterfly monitoring schemes are recording programs initiated to monitor nationwide butterfly abundance and distribution patterns, often with help from volunteers. The method generates high-resolution data, but may be associated with a degree of habitat sampling bias if volunteers prefer to survey areas perceived to be high-quality butterfly habitats. This can result in habitats becoming underrepresented in the data set, leading to less information about the butterfly populations there. In the present study, we investigate the possibility of applying a spatial design used by the Swedish Bird Survey for nationwide, grid-based sampling, with a goal to get butterfly monitoring data covering a representative sample of different habitats. We surveyed four 2x2 km sampling squares, split into 100 m segments, in the southernmost region of Sweden (Scania) and four in the northernmost region (Norrbotten). The grid-based transects were compared with volunteer-selected transects in a GIS analysis using a refined Swedish version of CORINE land cover data to see how well these two transect designs represent true habitat coverage. A total of 53 km transect was monitored, resulting in 490 individuals and 29 different species recorded. We found that transect cover correlated significantly with overall land cover using both monitoring methods, though standardised transects outperformed volunteer-selected transects in habitat representation in Scania, but not in Norrbotten. Butterflies were found to aggregate significantly in specific habitats, but with contrasting results for the two geographically different regions. Grasslands in both regions generated a high number of recorded butterflies, although so did clear-cut and residential areas in Norrbotten as well. The highest number of individuals recorded per transect was found in bogs in Scania. This study emphasises the value of complementing free site selection monitoring schemes with spatially representative schemes such as the Swedish Bird Survey, and sheds some light on general habitat preferences for Swedish butterflies in two contrasting climatic regions.

AB  - Landa, A. & Skogland, T.dagger 1995: The relationship between population density and body size of wolverines Gulo gulo in Scandinavia. - Wildl. Biol. 1: 165-175. The number of wolverines Gulo gulo in Scandinavia has declined dramatically since the middle of the last century, and the numbers killed continued to decrease until the species was protected. In 1968 the species was protected in Sweden; in 1973 the wolverine was given full protection in southern Norway and protection during the breeding period in northern Norway; and in 1982 the species was also given full protection in northern Norway. The protection has resulted in some increase in number, but the population density remains much lower than at the turn of the century, and the wolverine has yet not reoccupied all of its former range. Our analyses show that body size, as reflected by skull characters, was inversely correlated with population density from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-to late twentieth century. In contrast we found a strong decline in body size in the decades after ca 1960. The unexpectedly low wolverine resilience in this century may be explained by an energy-restricted model whose main factors include: 1) habitat fragmentation, 2) loss of habitat, 3) extinction of the dominant predator, the wolf Canis lupus, and 4) a maximised turnover in managed ungulate populations that has resulted in less natural mortality and fewer weakened animals available for scavengers and less efficient predators like the wolverine.

AB  - Traditional sectors, such as agriculture and fishing, often receive special treatment from policymakers because such sectors are perceived to be associated with traditional cultural public good values. However, these values are often difficult to measure, and few attempts have been made to do so. The recent European Union (EU) eel management directive creates an unusually clear-cut tradeoff between eel fishing and other agents affecting the European eel population. It is possible, therefore, to directly measure the perceived public good value of the eel fishery in terms of other economic costs that policymakers are willing to incur in order to maintain eel fishing. Using Swedish data, we find that Swedish policymakers value the public good aspect of the remaining Swedish eel fishery at a minimum of SEK 34 million (approximately EUR 3.4 million) annually, which is more than the commercial eel fishery's actual production value.

AB  - We present an analysis of long-term (1988-2013; 26 years) total phosphorus (TP) concentration trends in 81 Swedish boreal lakes subject tominimal anthropogenic disturbance. Near universal increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and a widespread but hitherto unexplained decline in TP were observed. Over 50% of the lakes (n = 42) had significant declining TP trends over the past quarter century (Sen's slope = 2.5% y(-1)). These declines were linked to catchment processes related to changes in climate, recovery from acidification, and catchment soil properties, but were unrelated to trends in P deposition. Increasing DOC concentrations appear to be masking in-lake TP declines. When the effect of increasing DOC was removed, the small number of positive TP trends (N = 5) turned negative and the average decline in TP increased to 3.9% y(-1). The greatest relative TP declines occurred in already nutrient poor, oligotrophic systems and TP concentrations have reached the analytical detection limit (1 mu L-1) in some lakes. In addition, ongoing oligotrophication may be exacerbated by increased reliance on renewable energy from forest biomass and hydropower. It is a cause of significant concern that potential impairments to lake ecosystem functioning associated with oligotrophication are not well handled by a management paradigm focused exclusively on the negative consequences of increasing phosphorus concentrations.

AB  - Since the mid-1990s, it has been common practice to leave trees for biodiversity purposes when clear-cutting in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and regulations for such tree retention are today included in national legislation and certification standards. Peer-reviewed research publications on tree retention from studies performed in the three countries were analyzed and about 50 relevant biodiversity studies were found, with the first published in 1994. Most studies were directed towards beetles and dead wood, especially high stumps. General conclusions were that retention trees (1) provide some of the substrate types required by early-successional species, (2) alleviate the most serious consequences of clear-cutting on biota, and (3) cannot maintain characteristics of intact mature forests. Larger volumes and more trees tend to maintain diversity better. There is a particular lack of studies on dispersal, landscape effects and long-term dynamics. There is a need to study further the relationship between the biota and the amount of trees, as well as their spatial arrangement. Retention trees should preferably be evaluated in relation to other components in multiscaled conservation, including woodland key habitats and larger protected areas.

AB  - Several new forestry practices directed at mitigating the influence of clear-cutting on biodiversity and other ecosystem properties have been launched recently. Retention forestry is the most widespread of these practices, but so far most studies have evaluated effects of retention levels that are higher than commonly applied by forestry in many parts of the world. Furthermore possible interaction effects between retaining forest structures and other common forestry practices, such as prescribed burning are still largely unexplored. Here we present results from a ten year stand-level factorial forestry experiment in Eastern Finland (FIRE1) with retention levels full (100%), elevated (50 m(3)/ha), low (10 m(3)/ha) and no retention (0%) combined with or without prescribed burning. We show that neither low, nor elevated retention is sufficient to influence the vegetation composition, or dynamic relative to no retention in unburned sites at stand level. However, retention in combination with prescribed burning influenced post-harvest community composition, so that species composition of the elevated retention treatment differed from low- and no retention treatments. When prescribed burning was applied, the functionally important species Vaccinium vitis-idaea had two times higher cover in stands with elevated retention compared to stands with low or no retention. We conclude that at the stand level, low retention levels do not mitigate clear-cut induced disturbance and retention can neither preserve the pre-harvest vegetation nor change the post-harvest vegetational dynamic.

AB  - In the mid-1960s, fertilization (with nitrogen) had a breakthrough as a promising forest management method in Swedish company owned forests. The activity grew and peaked during the 1970s but then lost ground and stabilized at a low level in the 1990s and early 2000s. Over the last five years, however, interest in fertilizing Swedish forests has increased again. In this article both the forestry industry's, and the environmental movement's, attitudes toward forest fertilization over time are investigated. Furthermore, conflicting persistent ideas about nature and future, i.e.,. figures of thought., within interest groups, representing forestry and the environmental movement respectively, are identified and analyzed in relation to the debate on fertilization. The analysis reveals mainly three figures of thought that have influenced this debate during the period,. the idea of progress.,. the idea of decay. and. the idea of the great chain of being.. The study thus sheds light on how the relationship between forestry and the environmental movement has evolved from the 1960s until today and uncovers thought patterns that have stood, and continue to stand, in opposition to one another.

AB  - The current emergence of a new space economy is leading to the exploration of outer space towards unforeseen futures. Space tourism is a new addition to the tourism industry, prompted in large part by adventure-seeking individualism and potentially lucrative private business prospects. However, in light of the current megatrend of environmentalism, different space tourism activities are facing climate change-related challenges to convince the greater public of their necessity, especially as the high cost involved for suborbital space travel limits it to a niche adventure activity for the wealthy. This article explores the views held by the Finnish populace in relation to space tourism and sustainability through an empirical study. The data are derived from two surveys: the first gathering Finnish public opinion on space tourism's sustainability with the use of principal component analysis; the second utilising a professional Delphi panel for qualitative explanations. The findings, analysed using grounded theory, can be compressed into four dimensions - "virtual travel", "comparative fairness", "technological innovations" and "ecopolitics" - through which actions towards sustainability in space tourism might be enhanced in different national planning strategies.

AB  - This article examines the impact of landholding and differences in local economies on age at marriage, on frequency of service and on household size and structure in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Particular stress is placed on the role of economic rather than cultural factors as determinants of regional variations in marriage age and household structures. Households were more complex whenever land, the accumulation of capital and multiple occupations were required for economic activity. Conversely, wage work - whether in fishing or agriculture and regardless of geographical location (for example in eastern as well as western Finland) -favoured the formation of small nuclear households. Some aspects of the family system (servanthood and a late age at marriage) fit the characteristics of the north-west European household system as delineated by John Hajnal and Peter Laslett better than others (frequency of complex households). It is concluded that there is no inevitable correlation between geographic location and the characteristics of a society's family system and that the model of the north-west European household system does not accommodate those societies where people were in a position to build strategies based on the continuous possession of land.

AB  - For many years there has been substantial urban political and economic interest in exploiting the use of cultural and aesthetic planning in order to improve the position of cities, within an expanding inter-urban competition. Built environments, places and spaces, have been regenerated in order to exploit their aesthetic, cultural, and historical significance so as to enhance commercial, consumption and public value, either for their citizens and/or tourists and capital. To date, discussions on urban planning have mostly ignored the fact that this 'millennium urbanism' also requires a lot of 'discursive planning', especially about the production of a place-identity and an urban imaginary. Discursive planning means staging the social meaning of urban space through texts, photographs, and visual signs. Aesthetic urban planning is not only about creating ambient surroundings, but also creating images, symbolic representations, and fantasies discursively using books and advertising, newspapers and television, research, and political agendas. These discursive practices are used to signify an identifiable and/or imaginary place-identity to form a sense of place or feeling of belonging to place. The article first discusses the theoretical relationship between discursive planning and representational space. The 'how' of discursive planning will be exemplified using the Environmental City Programme in Oslo, Norway as a case-study. I conclude by discussing how this form of urban planning needs a reflexive and semiotic community.

AB  - To date, the share of research, teaching materials, and practices related to the use of timber in bridge projects in Finland are quite limited compared to other materials, such as concrete. This article, which also includes a structural design example for dimensioning a girder bridge, focuses on the status, applications and prospects of wood use in bridge construction, reflecting the Finnish professionals' point of view. Key findings highlighted that: (1) the ideal use of wood would be in private road bridges and light traffic bridges; (2) while the use of wood in the bridge was assessed to be advantageous in terms of ecology, aesthetics, and environmental friendliness, it was reported to be disadvantageous in terms of long-term durability and connection details; (3) concrete and steel, whose prices fluctuate, could gradually be replaced by wood, a renewable material; (4) timber-concrete composite bridges were expected to become widespread in the future; (5) cross-laminated timber (CLT) could open up an opportunity for bridge decks; and (6) service limit state is often decisive for the dimensioning of wooden bridges. It is recommended to implement large-scale public projects for the wooden bridges by creating sustainable business models that will be supported both legitimately and economically by the local government. In this sense, close cooperation between authorities and other key market stakeholders is crucial.

AB  - The present increase of atmospheric N2O has caused concern since N2O contributes to the greenhouse effect as well as to the destruction of stratospheric ozone.  The purpose of this study is to provide a basis for political decisions on a national level and to identify gaps in our knowledge about the emissions of N2O.  It is estimated that the Swedish emissions of N2O have approximately doubled due to anthropogenic activities.  The natural production of N2O is dominated by emissions from forest soils.  The most significant anthropogenic sources seem to be stationary combustion, traffic and fertilizer use.  In order to formulate a rational strategy for decreasing the current level of emission the uncertainty ranges of known sources have to be narrowed, and possible additional sources have to be identified.

AB  - Experience gained from cultural heritage management in Norway and the UK has led to the development of a framework describing the key conservation activities required to sustain a diverse range between material cultural heritage assets. A soft system approach allows the complex interaction between various activities and external factors impacting on cultural heritage management to be examined as a single entity, for example, the contributions made by human interaction, environmental impact and the properties of the material heritage itself, on the preservation or loss of a cultural object. By constructing such a framework it is possible to identify potential indicators that can be used to measure the quality of conservation activities. Arguments are presented for grouping these indicators of impact into social, economic and environmental categories and examples are given of how this approach can be universally applied to real situations.

AB  - There is a lack of critical engagement and a focus on practical solutions in sustainable tourism debates. Research on biosphere reserve (BR) tourists has focused mainly on descriptions, while not critically engaging in issues relating to sustainable tourism. This article explores tourists' reflections on sustainable development in the landscape of a Swedish BR. The findings indicate that BR landscapes can increase environmental awareness, that aesthetics are important to how tourists make sense of sustainability, and that the functionality of the BR landscape shows how people perceive environmental concerns and how they see their own roles in affecting the landscape.

AB  - The core aim of the study was to gain insight into the cross-country differences in traffic risk perception and driving behaviour and also how culture and cultural differences may influence perceived risk and risk behaviour by comparing a sample of the Russian population with a sample of the Norwegian population. A new measurement instrument aimed at measuring culture as symbol exchange was applied. Self-completion questionnaire surveys were carried out among representative samples of the Norwegian (n = 247) and the Russian (n = 299) population aged 18 years and over. The results showed that culture defined as symbol exchange was weakly associated with risk perception. It is suggested that research carried out to date on the role of culture in risk research may have focused on criterion variables which are not very relevant. However, while traffic safety culture does not seem to be important for risk perception, this study shows that it seems to be relevant for drivers' risk behaviour and thus it is still relevant and important to focus on traffic culture in risk research despite the fact that culture does not predict perceived risk. As symbol exchange, the newly developed measure of traffic safety culture is capable of predicting drivers' risk behaviour in traffic and is therefore a valid predictor of traffic safety.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine if there are any cross-cultural differences between Swedish and Turkish drivers' rating of the variables in the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) with regard to complying with the speed limit. A sample of 219 Swedish and 252 Turkish drivers completed a questionnaire including questions based on the theory of planned behaviour (i.e. regarding attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, intention and behaviour). The results show that country differences in drivers' intention to comply with the speed limit as well as their self-reported compliance could be explained by differences found in their attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Furthermore, drivers who live in a country with fewer road traffic fatalities (i.e. Sweden), compared with drivers who live in a country with more road traffic fatalities (i.e. Turkey), reported a more positive attitude towards complying with the speed limit, a more positive subjective norm, a higher perceived behavioural control, a higher intention and a larger proportion of the time spent complying.

AB  - The beetle genus Agathidium is the largest insect group documented that principally feeds on slime moulds. Agathidium pulchellum, one of the rarest Agathidium species in Europe, is listed in the EU's Habitats Directive. We studied the habitat associations of A. pulchellum in 44 sites located in old-growth and managed forests in eastern Finland. Agathidium pulchellum occurred exclusively on the slime-mould species Trichia decipiens. The host was associated with mid-decayed aspen, spruce and birch logs, and its incidence grew with both increasing log diameter and stand-level log density of spruce and aspen. We also observed that even if its host was present, the beetle was absent from sites with less than 80 aspen and spruce logs per hectare. All sites with A. pulchellum were natural forests of high conservation value. Our results show that it is possible to systematically survey the occurrence of A. pulchellum.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has been suggested to be responsible for major genetic differentiations in a range of marine organisms. In this study, we combined genetic data and environmental information to unravel the relative role of geography and habitat heterogeneity on patterns of genetic population structure of corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops), a rocky shore species at the northern limit of its distribution range in Scandinavia. Our results revealed a major genetic break separating populations inhabiting the western and southern coasts of Norway. This genetic break coincides with the longest stretch of sand in the whole study area, suggesting habitat fragmentation as a major driver of genetic differentiation of this obligate rocky shore benthic fish in Scandinavia. The complex fjords systems extending along the western coast of Norway appeared responsible for further regional genetic structuring. Our findings indicate that habitat discontinuities may lead to significant genetic fragmentation over short geographical distances, even for marine species with a pelagic larval phase, as for this rocky shore fish.

AB  - Most Scandinavian boathouses predating the Reformation (AD 1537) are located in Norway, starting in the Early Iron Age, and a majority are found in the north. Following a critical review of Norwegian boathouse studies from a historical and regional perspective, current research themes in northern Norway are discussed. Boathouses are viewed as multifunctional entities providing insights into the marine economy, social organization, and ethnic interaction between Sami and Norse populations. A more balanced and holistic perspective is needed in which boathouses are seen as a central component of the maritime cultural landscape with uses extending substantially beyond boat storage.

AB  - Growing numbers of wild ungulates are increasingly seen by concerned authorities in Europe as posing serious management problems, which include increasing browsing pressure by moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Swedish forests. Recent investigations by the Swedish Forest Agency identify high browsing pressure as the main reason for a recent decline in regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), one of the two main commercial species in Swedish forestry. The high browsing pressure is also having a negative impact on biodiversity. Thus, voices within the forest community claim that browsing pressure has never been so high. This paper examines that claim from a historical perspective by comparing livestock grazing in forest pastures a century ago with contemporary game browsing, and identifying the main factors driving both the livestock exodus from Swedish forests during the first half of the twentieth century and the rapid increase in deer populations during the second half. Finally, testing the claim that browsing impact has never been so high, past grazing and present browsing are theoretically sized up and compared. Estimates of live weights and numbers of large herbivores in 1902 and 2012 are used. The result indicates that the claim might possibly be lacking in historical context.

AB  - To better understand the relationship between soil bacterial communities, soil physicochemical properties, land use and geographical distance, we considered for the first time ever a European transect running from Sweden down to Portugal and from France to Slovenia. We investigated 71 sites based on their range of variation in soil properties (pH, texture and organic matter), climatic conditions (Atlantic, alpine, boreal, continental, Mediterranean) and land uses (arable, forest and grassland). 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial communities highly varied in diversity, richness, and structure according to environmental factors. At the European scale, taxa area relationship (TAR) was significant, supporting spatial structuration of bacterial communities. Spatial variations in community diversity and structure were mainly driven by soil physicochemical parameters. Within soil clusters (k-means approach) corresponding to similar edaphic and climatic properties, but to multiple land uses, land use was a major driver of the bacterial communities. Our analyses identified specific indicators of land use (arable, forest, grasslands) or soil conditions (pH, organic C, texture). These findings provide unprecedented information on soil bacterial communities at the European scale and on the drivers involved; possible applications for sustainable soil management are discussed.

AB  - Illegal killing of wildlife is challenging conservation efforts worldwide. Ecological research has shown that illegal killing is severely affecting the transboundary Swedish-Norwegian wolf population. A previous study indicated that unwillingness to report illegal killing of wolves among Swedish hunters contains an element of protest against perceived unjust treatment of hunting and hunters but that it could also simply be a reflection of ineffective law enforcement in the backcountry, driving hunters to effect forms of self-policing. Based on a survey of Norwegian hunters, the present research goes one step further. One in five hunters decline to report illegal wolf killings, and unwillingness to report is predicted by lack of trust in environmental institutions and a general anti-elite sentiment. Hunting-related issues and other factors also affect outcomes, but to a lesser degree. We conclude that unwillingness to report is often part of an oppositional stance related not only to wildlife management and conservation, but to contemporary social change in rural areas and perceived societal power relations. It is unlikely that reluctance to report is driven by frustration over inefficient official enforcement. While a political dimension is not always articulated, overlooking it may stoke conflicts and fortify a perception of unjust power relations.

Specifically, we report the cumulative energy use, biotic resource use, and greenhouse gas, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions associated with producing farmed salmon in Norway, the UK, British Columbia (Canada), and Chile, as well as a production-weighted global average. We found marked differences in the nature and quantity of material/energy resource use and associated emissions per unit production across regions. This suggests significant scope for improved environmental performance in the industry as a whole. We identify key leverage points for improving performance, most notably the critical importance of least-environmental cost feed sourcing patterns and continued improvements in feed conversion efficiency, Overall, impacts were lowest for Norwegian production in most impact categories, and highest for UK farmed salmon. Our results are of direct relevance to industry, policy makers, eco-labeling programs, and consumers seeking to further sustainability objectives in salmon aquaculture.

AB  - Recent research has identified a series of human geography impacts of natural resource developments in sparsely populated areas like the Arctic. These impacts can be mapped to the 'resource cycle', and arise from periods of population growth and decline, changing patterns of human migration and mobility, changing patterns of settlement, and changes in the demographic 'balance' between males and females, young and old, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This paper examines the applicability of the resource cycle model in the case of hydro energy development in the Jokkmokk municipality of Sweden. Using quantitative demographic data, media reports, and contemporary accounts of hydro development, the paper describes the human geography of Jokkmokk since the late 19th century. The paper concludes that changes in human geography in Jokkmokk mirror what has been observed in regions dependent on non-renewable resources, although it is difficult to distinguish many impacts from those that might have occurred under alternative development scenarios. The paper identifies a 'settlement cycle' with phases of integrated and separated habitation for populations specifically associated with the development. Settlement dynamics, and the impacts of hydro on Sami geography are areas for further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Biosphere Reserve (BR) concept aims at encouraging sustainable development (SD) towards sustainability on the ground by promoting three core functions: conservation, development, and logistic support. Sweden and Ukraine exemplify the diverse governance contexts that BRs need to cope with. We assessed how the BR concept and its core functions are captured in national legislations. The results show that the core functions are in different ways reflected in legal documents in both countries. While in Ukraine the BR concept is incorporated into legislation, in Sweden the concept is used as a soft law. In Ukraine managers desired stronger legal enforcement, while in Sweden managers avoided emphasis on legislation when collaborating with local stakeholders. Hence, BR implementation have adapted to different political cultures by development of diverse approaches. We conclude that a stronger legal support might not be needed for BRs, rather SD needs to be recognized as an integrated place-based process at multiple levels.

AB  - Cold-water coral reefs represent some of the most biodiverse and biomass rich ecosystems in the marine environment. Despite this, ecosystem functioning is still poorly understood and the susceptibility of key species to anthropogenic activities and pollutants is unknown. In European waters, cold-water corals are often found in greatest abundance on the continental margin, often in regions rich in hydrocarbon reserves.
   In this viewpoint paper we discuss some of the current strategies employed in predicting and minimizing exposure of cold-water coral reef ecosystems on the Norwegian margin to waste materials produced during offshore drilling operations by the oil and gas industry. In the light of recent in situ and experimental research conducted with the key reef species Lophelia pertusa, we present some possible improvements to these strategies which may be utilized by industry and managers to further reduce the likelihood of exposure. We further highlight important outstanding research questions in this field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tendency of species richness to increase with patch area is one of the most robust empirical generalisations in ecology and its logic drives conservation actions. Indeed, preference is often given to conserving large, highly connected areas over small isolated patches. However, small habitats have been shown to be important biodiversity refuges in managed landscapes. Field islands are small remnants of natural habitat patches surrounded by cropland. While their island-like position in a species-poor crop field makes them potentially strategic habitats for biodiversity conservation, they have not received much attention in ecological studies. We investigated how local (i.e. field island area and habitat diversity) and landscape factors (i.e. proportion of arable land) affected orthopteran species richness, community mean dispersal and habitat specificity in 71 field islands in central Sweden. We found that despite low numbers of species per field island, due to their intrinsic small size, taken together, a system of small field island increased species richness and included a large proportion of the regional species pool in the arable landscape in central Sweden. Furthermore, we found that patch area and habitat diversity determined orthopteran community composition in field islands. More diverse and, to a lesser extent, larger field islands benefit sedentary and habitat specialist species. This study shows that more care should be taken to incorporate and potentially also prioritize small and permanent habitat patches in the management of agricultural landscapes. The protection of field islands with diverse habitats may be important for the maintenance of sedentary and specialist species.

AB  - Pollution problems in aquatic sediments can be quite varied - from the widespread contamination of a coastal bay receiving untreated urban or industrial discharge to the local leakage from underground petroleum tanks or pipelines. The variation of such problems is further expanded by the range of sediment characteristics in which they occur. Sediments particles can be carriers, receptors and sources for contaminants. The effectiveness of these roles is largely related to their adsorptive capacity; governed mainly by particle size, mineralogy and organic matter, as well as site-specific geochemical conditions. Sustainable management requires a source-to-sink system perspective in order to prescribe remedial actions. The relationships between sediment parameters and pollution problems are summarized and then briefly illustrated using the environmental sedimentology of three harbors: Bergen (Norway), Gothenburg (Sweden), and Ventspils (Latvia).

AB  - Development of sustainable breeding goals for dairy production has to consider the producers' preferences which are likely to differ between production systems. The number of dairy producers with herds certified according to the standards of organic production has increased during the last decades. Traditionally, organic producers use animals selected in conventional production systems but the traits important in organic herds have been suggested to differ due to the different production conditions. The aim of this study was to assess what traits Swedish organic and conventional daily producers consider to be important for the cows in their herds, and the relative importance of traits in the two production systems.
   An advanced web questionnaire with an underlying selection index was developed. The selection index was not shown to the respondents but it enabled them to weight traits against each other based on the genetic progress obtained. The questionnaire also included questions about what traits the producers intuitively considered important for the cows in their herds and how they ranked 15 given production and functional traits. The questionnaire was answered by 468 Swedish dairy producers of which 122 had a certified organic herd and 346 had a conventional herd.
   The results of this study show that the trait longevity was ranked first by both organic and conventional Swedish dairy producers. However, the ranking differed to some extent between the production systems for other traits, e.g. mastitis resistance and milk production. Swedish producers with organic herds tended to desire a higher genetic gain in disease resistance, including mastitis and parasite resistance, compared with producers with conventional herds. The results also reflect a somewhat lower interest in milk production level among producers with organic production. However, as the traits most important for Swedish producers with organic herds are already considered in the current Nordic breeding goal they can continue the use of this animal material.

AB  - Our cross-national study examined the views of forestry students from Brazil, China and Finland on the highly debated issue of forestry education. Altogether, views from 584 Bachelor students from three programmes in the three countries were collected. Students' perceptions of importance of subject-specific and generic competencies and experiences, preferred area of work, and willingness to do a Master's degree were asked through a questionnaire in the respective national language. Quantitative analyses included comparisons across universities and study years, as well as influence of gender, grades, and satisfaction. Great similarities across the countries regarding the students' views on subject-specific competencies and experiences, as well as on the preferred areas of work were found. The students highly valued field experiences as well as areas such as environmental protection. Upon graduation a majority wished to work in the management of public forests, followed by industries in the case of Brazil and Finland and research in the case of China. Changes across the study years, such as the increasing importance given to oral and writing skills by students of later years, were observed. These and other results and their implications are discussed in consideration of cultural, curricular and institutional factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim We analysed the role of species interactions in wildlife community responses to urbanization. Specifically, we investigated non-trophic associations within a bird community and the role of trophic interactions in the responses of bird species to the urbanization gradient. Location City-state of Berlin, Central Europe. Methods Arthropod and bird abundances were sampled across the study area and analysed using hierarchical joint species distribution models (JSDMs). Urbanization gradient was defined by environmental predictors reflecting anthropogenic disturbances, for example noise level and human population density, as well as nature-like features, for example tree cover and open green area. Relevant environmental predictors for each group and relevant spatial resolution were selected a priori using AICc. Arthropod abundances were modelled for the bird sampling transects and included as additional predictor variable in the bird community model. In this model, we used abundances and traits of 66 breeding bird species as response variables. Results Bird species responses to urbanization were captured by the interaction between invertebrate abundance and environmental predictors. We identified three groups of birds: the urban group (12 species) showed no decrease in abundance along the urbanization gradient and were not related to arthropods abundance; the woodland group (18 species) were positively related to tree cover and arthropod abundance, also in areas with high anthropogenic disturbance; and the nature group (36 species) were positively related to arthropod abundance, but the species abundance decreased sharply with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. All the non-trophic associations found within the bird community were positive. Main conclusions Arthropod abundance clearly modulated birds' responses to the urbanization gradient for most species. Especially at moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, the abundance of arthropods is key for the occurrence and abundance of bird species in urban areas. To maintain bird diversity in urban green areas, management measures should focus on maintaining and increasing invertebrate abundance.

AB  - Many national energy policies envisage residual and renewable heat sources with district heating (DH) as a component of sustainable energy systems. There is however limited empirical evidence about facilitation of development in the context of liberalised markets and diminished local government control over direct service provision. Recent attempts to stimulate DH have had variable outcomes in different countries. Using five case studies, we ask why heat network development in the UK takes a relatively piecemeal and fragmented form in comparison with the Netherlands and Norway, countries whose heating sectors are comparable with the UK and where DH provision is limited. We argue that energy market liberalisation has been enacted differentially, resulting in different political and economic governance structures: in comparison with the UK liberal market economy, the more coordinated market economies of the Netherlands and Norway retain greater capacity for collaboration between energy utilities, localities and states, resulting in stronger foundations for district energy. Implications for UK governance are considered.

AB  - River basin planning in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has always been a complex, yet important topic, which has gained a new momentum with the approval of EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) in December 2000. The ultimate goal of WFD is to achieve a good ecological status/potential of all water bodies before 2015. Together with the implementation of WFD also principles of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) are to be applied and national expansions of Natura 2000 networks are in progress.
   There are many elements which are important in river basin planning systems. In the Baltic Sea region for example, the pressures posed by economic activities including increasing tourism and port activities have to be considered in land and river basin planning. These matters are dealt with in the context of the Watersketch project, a scheme supported by the Interreg IIIB programme of the European Union. The project aims at producing an extensive planning system and a working scheme that accounts for the various, complex and opposing tasks currently subjected to water usage. The main goal is to produce and describe processes, that aid planning and decision making also in areas with limited resources to meet the diverse requirements concerning water. In addition, the project intends to:
   1) analyse and synthesize the different directives and conventions focused on use of water courses.
   2) demonstrate the major alternatives of river basin planning with a wide set of case studies ranging from southern tip of Baltic Sea (Poland) to northernmost corner of it (Norway).
   3) provide a Water Planning Decision Support System for spatial planners, which takes into account all main components needed for economically, socially and ecologically sustainable use of water courses.
   Raise capacity to promote the sustainable development in river basins by means of an information exchange platform, training workshops and the dissemination of the information needed for sustainable use of river basins by means of a handbook.
   By a combined approach where planning is complemented by training and information exchange, this project will provide a long-term contribution towards addressing the problem, at the same time that it links itself with other similar projects, achieving synergy and avoiding duplications,

AB  - As cities around the world increase in density, and the number of urban green spaces decrease, the role cemeteries play is becoming increasingly important. Highly vegetated cemeteries can provide important public green spaces in urban environments and give recreational opportunities to city residents. They are also important historical and cultural landscapes, and as places of burial they contain special sacred and social meanings. Cemeteries are complex places that can have a myriad of meaning and uses.
   This research examines cross-national differences between cemeteries in Sweden and the United States. It uses a case study method to compare two large historical cemeteries in urban environments: Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York in the United States and the ?Ostra kyrkog?rden (Eastern Cemetery) in Malmo?, Sweden. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers in both cemeteries complemented by site observations.
   This study explores differences in cemetery management, funding and form, and how these factors can affect the recreational usage of these spaces as public urban green space. The research compares how the funding differences between the United States and Sweden regarding the private versus public funding of cemeteries and burials affects cemetery management differences. It also examines how the physical form of a cemetery can affect public accessibility, use as urban green space and landscape management practices. Public use of ?Ostra kyrkog?rden and Green-Wood Cemetery as recreational urban green spaces has changed over time. Both cemeteries show how differences in management and physical form can affect public accessibility and their multifunctional usage as urban green spaces. National differences in private versus public cemetery funding, along with burial in perpetuity in the United States compared to grave reuse in Sweden, also have ramifications for the evolution and preservation of cemeteries.

AB  - Composite industrial areas created to store, process, and transport energy pose risks to the health, safety, property, and environment of their host communities. Whether these risks are seen as acceptable may, however, depend on frameworks applied in risk governance processes and may also be subject to controversy between stakeholders and roles. Individual companies and actors may follow safety standards and regulations within their domain, but the accumulated risks may not be properly evaluated. Furthermore, attitudes and perceptions about risk in host communities may trigger conflicts regarding the siting or continuance of activities or plans for new activities. The paper addresses these issues from a risk governance perspective, focusing on conflicting goals, roles, and knowledge base among decision-makers and on regulatory complexity. The empirical basis is comprised of two case studies of industrial areas including storage and transport of energy and dangerous goods in major harbors close to urban and populated areas. The first case is an LNG storage and distribution facility located in a harbor and industrial area in the Sola municipality near the city of Stavanger. Disputes about safety issues have arisen during the planning, construction, and current operation of this facility. The second case is a multiple-facility industrial area in Oslo Harbor that has been undergoing a major expansion combined with parallel expansions in public environments (e.g. housing, transport, institutions, etc.).

AB  - Current levels of forestry expansion in boreal forests threaten to radically reduce biodiversity. For many forest dwelling species the threat is not simply because the forest is used for biomass production, but rather how it is used. Retention forestry practices aim to limit impacts on biodiversity during the final felling stage of a forestry cycle. However, the efficiency of such methods in retaining biodiversity have rarely been studied for intermediate forestry stages (e.g., forest thinning) with experimental approaches entirely absent from boreal forests. Therefore, we conducted a before-after control-impact experiment in Sweden to investigate the short-term response in occurrence of individual bird species, guilds, and population trend groups (positive, stable, or negative population trend), as well as the response in nest box occupancy and in the reproductive success of Parus major to three different thinning treatments. The three treatments were i) conventional thinning at the plot and stand scale, (ii) understory retention thinning, where at least 250 spruces with live branches below 2 m above ground are retained per hectare, and (iii) complete retention plots, where the forest was not thinned on-1 ha plots within conventionally thinned forest stands. We found that conventional forest thinning was likely the cause for observed declines in bird occurrence, with-20% of the species showing clear negative responses. Our results indicate that understory retention thinning with double the retention level as previously suggested and combining conventional thinning with complete retention plots, could largely alleviate the short term negative effects of conventional thinning. This was the case for all guilds, population trend groups and individual bird species, except for Poecile montanus, which responded negatively to complete retention. Among the birds occupying the nest boxes, only Cyanistes caeruleus responded to any of the treatments, with higher nest box occupancy upon understory retention thinning. No thinning treatment affected reproductive success in P. major. Our results clearly show that thinning practices that retain the diversity of forest-dwelling birds are possible. Hence, this study provides a crucial puzzle piece towards more sustainable forestry practices in the boreal region.

AB  - During the early years after the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, a number of smuggling operations from behind the Wall were executed, and the reports of them spread through the Western media. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the popular Swedish men's magazines Lektyr and Fib Aktuellt published several exclusive photo reportages about such operations, providing Swedish readers with information about the East Germans' desire to escape their country, and the West Germans' willingness to assist. This article discusses the Swedish escape reports as examples of border crossing through their form as well as their content. It is analysed, how the escape reports published in Sweden both represented and generated border-crossing activity. The smuggling stories also illustrate the entangled character of popular print media: the travels of texts and pictures beyond national, cultural and lingual borders as well as travels between apposite publications. The material of the article consists of a total of ten reportages published in Lektyr and Fib Aktuellt between 1965-1966 and 1973.

AB  - This paper analyzes the effects on Swedish hinterland logistics of a port labor disruption that occurred in the Port of Gothenburg's container terminal in 2016-2017. Because of this dispute, several companies initiated mitigation strategies by moving their cargo by truck or rail in the area, thus utilizing the inherent advantages of hinterland locations and dry ports. Researching hinterland logistics in Sweden, this article conducts a case study on a dry port and the warehouse industry. The results show that the traffic share of inland terminals was higher during and soon after the conflict. Thus, this study suggests that dry ports are significant as potential solutions for this kind of disruption.

AB  - 2. Dispersal and movement rates in Glanville fritillary butterflies (Melitaea cinxia) originating from a continuous landscape in China and from a highly fragmented landscape in Finland were compared using three different methods.
   3. The methods included replicated mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments conducted in the natural environments in China and Finland, tracking with harmonic radar of captive-reared but free-flying butterflies in a common environment in the field, and replicated common garden experiments in a large outdoor population cage.
   4. The results were largely consistent, showing that butterflies from the more continuous landscape in China had a lower movement rate than butterflies originating from the fragmented landscape in Finland. Butterflies originating from newly-established populations in Finland moved significantly longer distances than butterflies originating from old populations in Finland or from China, demonstrating significant intra-specific variation in dispersal rate in Finland. These results are consistent with model predictions for the Glanville fritillary.
   5. The tracking experiment revealed a result that would have been impossible to obtain with MRR experiments: movement rate was influenced by a significant interaction between population origin (China vs. Finland) and ambient air temperature.

AB  - This paper addresses biodiversity management in supply chains. Biodiversity loss is one of the most critical environmental issues currently facing the planet, and yet, rather surprisingly, has received little attention by management scholars and researchers in supply chain management. This paper aims for greater theoretical and practical understanding of the issue by examining firms' purchasing and supply chain management practices that specifically relate to managing biodiversity. This qualitative study involves interviews with representatives of six firms and other organizations in Finland and New Zealand. The research shows how these firms adopt or develop biodiversity management practices that reduce or eliminate negative biodiversity outcomes or even contribute to biodiversity restoration and regeneration. Using an inductive theory building approach and integrating insights from the supply chain practice view into theorizing, this paper develops a theoretical framework of practices adopted and developed by firms to manage biodiversity.

AB  - We analyze cost-efficient conservation of boreal old-growth forests using three variants of the site selection framework. In all variants, the aim is to maximize biodiversity subject to a given resource constraint. Our benchmark, an integrated site selection model, takes into account both ecological and commercial values of the stands and defines a cost-efficient solution to conservation problems. The other two models are called the ecological and the penny-pincher models. The ecological model reflects current conservation practices and is based on ecological criteria. The penny-pincher model reflects an ad hoc preservation used earlier in many countries, which leads to selection of the stands having the lowest commercial value irrespective of their ecological features. Using Finnish data on forest dwelling species and commercial values of the stands, we demonstrate that the integrated model leads to 9-19% higher conservation cost-efficiency than the other two models. We also show that the xeric forest type may be underrepresented in the current old-growth forest preservation network in this region.

AB  - Uncovering anthropogenic and environmental drivers behind past biological change requires integrated analyses of long-term records from a diversity of disciplines. We applied an interdisciplinary approach exploring effects of human land-use and environmental changes on vegetation dynamics at Lake Ljogottjern in southeastern Norway during the Holocene. Combined analysis of pollen and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding of the sedimentary sequence of the lake describes the vegetation dynamics at different scales, and establishes a timeline for pastoral farming activities. We integrate this reconstruction with geochemical analysis of the sediments, climate data, archaeological evidence of local human settlement and regional human population dynamics.
   Our data covering the last 10,000 years reveals consistent vegetation signals from pollen and sedaDNA indicating periods of deforestation connected to cultivation, matching the archaeological evidence. Multivariate analysis integrating the environmental data from geochemical and archaeological reconstructions with the vegetation composition indicates that the vegetation dynamics at Lake Ljogottjern were primarily related to natural processes from the base of the core (in ca. 8000 BCE, Mesolithic) up to the Early Iron Age (ca. 500 BCE-550 CE), when agricultural activities in the region intensified. The pollen signal reflects the establishment of a Bronze Age (ca. 1800-500 BCE) farm in the area, while subsequent intensification of pollen concentrations of cultivated plants combined with the first sedaDNA signals of cultivation and pastoralism are consistent with evidence of the establishment of farming closer to the lake at around 300 BCE. These signals also correspond to the intensification of agriculture in southeastern Norway in the first centuries of the Early Iron Age. Applying an interdisciplinary approach allows us to reconstruct anthropogenic and environmental dynamics, and untangle effects of human land-use and environmental changes on vegetation dynamics in southeastern Norway during the Holocene.

AB  - Sweden is applying the herd-immunity as its main natural science strategy to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. This has been communicated in a transparent manner. Small groups of young(er) people of up to approximately 50 individuals are subject to a bigger risk of infection than others. The objective of this paper is to make a case for the argument, that alongside herd-immunity, Sweden is using the social science originated planning approach: backcasting. The government has not been transparent on backcasting. The authors present the use of backcasting only as an argument based on available data and authors' reasoning. A backcasting exercise for the case of the Swedish economy is constructed. This frame outlines five interdependent levels with which a national economy can apply what this paper calls a backcasting herd-immunity approach in its COVID-19 policy. The authors further suggest how it is possible to use social science, natural science and political ideology as complementary in COVID-19 mitigation in particular and in sustainability strategies in general.

AB  - Over recent decades, rural urban migration and a decrease in wealth have been major challenges faced by European rural areas. Maintaining urban and rural settlements throughout the country has been an important aim of Norwegian regional politics. This paper assesses the impact of second home tourism on local economic development in rural municipalities in Norway. The study is based on data collected as part of an ongoing research project initiated in 2002. Having developed and tested a model consisting of socioeconomic factors and factors associated with the second home as such, the authors examine how and to what extent these factors explain the impact of second home tourism on local economic growth. They find that the size and standard of the recreational home are important factors in explaining variations in annual consumption by second home owners, and more so in rural communities with a broad and well-structured trading activity than in areas with a weaker trading structure. It appears that urban recreational tourism based on second homes of high standard offers the best potential for sustainable local rural economic growth. Based on their findings, the authors also discuss possible local government strategies to achieve economic growth through second home tourism.

AB  - Stakeholders' objectives regarding regional forest policy were evaluated for the area covered by four northernmost Forestry Centres in Finland. The data were collected through a postal questionnaire with 431 respondents, and the judges were asked to assess the importance of the objectives of the regional forest policy on a ratio scale. The data were analysed applying statistical techniques developed for preference elicitation in forestry-related decision making. The results showed that the stakeholder group is the most important characteristic describing the objectives of regional forest policy. Regional characteristics in the form of different Forestry Centres had only a minor impact on assessments. Among other things, the analysis indicates that the objectives in utilizing forests more effectively without increasing cuttings are supported throughout the stakeholder groups. A comparison of the results with the corresponding Regional Forest Programmes indicates that some stakeholders have objectives that are not implemented properly. Further research is needed to find out whether this is a problem from the viewpoint of sustainable forest management.

AB  - In Finland, the conservation of large mammalian carnivores-brown bear, lynx, wolf and wolverine-is undermined by illegal killings that have commonly taken place after the implementation of national carnivore management plans. This hidden form of criminality cannot occur to such an extent without strong support from the local community. We examined the support of proximate groups by collecting data from hunters and women. In collecting data, we used non-active role playing with empathy-based fictitious stories. We used argumentation analysis to reveal the assumed species, the background of the illegal killing and especially the justifications and importance of community support for illegal killing. The results show that we have a conflict with strong basic emotions in hand as both illegal killing and support for illegal killing and hunting violators are based on anger and fear for children and domestic animals as well as frustration toward the authorities and the lack of proper management actions. The wolf is at the centre of the conflict due to the specific character of the species. Current policies have inevitably been lacking in terms of place-based policy, and that has led to conflicts between game management authorities/researchers and ordinary citizens. To facilitate a change in attitudes, we suggest focusing on affective factors via confidence-building measures.

AB  - The Environmental Programme for Forestry (1994), New Forest Act and Nature Conservation Act (1997) are steering forestry in Finland towards greater attention to ecological sustainability. Concerning the impacts that forestry has on water ecosystems, current directives are based on abundant research knowledge, but preventative measures are still underdeveloped. This report presents the first results obtained on the use of overland-flow fields in preventing forest regeneration activities impacting on water-ecosystems. Following the completion of ditch excavation or mounding, Concentrations of solid matter in the water at the lower end of the overland-flow field were only 6% of those measured in the sedimentation ditch following the completion of ditching and mounding. Similarly, the total nitrogen concentration was 9% and that of total phosphorus 48%. The amount of leached soluble nutrients was also reduced. Soluble phosphorus was 11% and that of soluble nitrogen 20% of the levels in water in the sedimentation ditch. The results of this pilot study are encouraging. They provide a basis for recommending the use of overland-flow fields in water-pollution mitigation.

AB  - In this paper we explore the discourses of ecology, environmental economics, new environmental pragmatism and social ecological economics as they relate to the value of ecosystems and biodiversity. Conceptualizing biodiversity and ecosystems as goods and services that can be represented by monetary values in policy processes is an economic discourse being increasingly championed by ecologists and conservation biologists. The latter promote a new environmental pragmatism internationally as hardwiring biodiversity and ecosystems services into finance. The approach adopts a narrow instrumentalism, denies value pluralism and incommensurability, and downplays the role of scientific knowledge. Re-establishing an ecological discourse in biodiversity policy implies a crucial role for biophysical indicators as independent policy targets, exemplified in this paper by the Nature Index for Norway. Yet, there is a recognisable need to go beyond a traditional ecological approach to one recognising the interconnections of social, ecological and economic problems. This requires reviving and relating to a range of alternative ecologically informed discourses, including an ecofeminist perspective, in order to transform the increasingly dominant and destructive relationship of humans separated from and domineering over Nature.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Forest cultures observed at European and world level possess great importance. Culture establishment or afforestation practice throughout which unforested area is brought to controlled wood production, if considered in relation to uncontrolled natural succession, presents enhancement of wood production, growing stock structure and altogether enhancement of total biological and social potential of the area. Even though in comparison with broadleaved natural stands, conifer cultures in general and spruce monocultures in particular, have less favorable impacts on specific site features but their advantages are still greater than disadvantages in relation to areas left to natural succession. In addition, possible negative impacts are mitigated by the fact that they are completely renewable and economical, social, cultural and environmentaly sustainable source when clever planning, management, utilization and marketing is applied. Norway spruce has got very important role since its site requirements are extremely low and it could act as a favorable species for afforestation processes. The specific European historical and management circumstances and management problems could not be related to Croatian while at the same time specific given solutions could not be applied to Croatian site conditions and management possibilities without more detailed insight. Insight into these differences is needed especially because management of spruce monocultures in Croatia entails substantial past and present unresolved problems. This species currently presents the only autochthonous high productive tree species suitable for afforestation. In specific, all differences related to possible further afforestation practice and spruce monoculture management options have been considered, for instance, total area and size of monocultures, social, economical, management and silvicultural circumstances which altogether could present advantages or disadvantages for N. spruce cultures increase (pure or mixed with broadleaved species) and change of management options in the future.
   Discussion and Conclusion: Current amount of available land for afforestation in Croatia is subjected to rough estimations (about 1 million ha) which in comparison with the total of 2 688 687 ha of forests and forest land clearly shows the importance of the afforestation potential and possibilities for Croatia. Even with addition of growing negative environmental impacts specific problems connected with spruce monocultures are mainly connected with intensive production which withdraw additional silvicultural measures to enhance productivity and stability and lower the damages. If all considerations are taken into account monocultures on large areas, in more than one subsequent rotations and on unfavorable sites, add to lack of stability and productivity and growing environmental problems which otherwise could be avoided. Since in Croatia those kind of spruce management is not practiced and available afforestation areas are fragmented and small, those negative impacts could be avoided and N. spruce as only autochthonous species with high production could be proper solution for afforestation on significant land area. And, when planned and managed as first successional step on abandoned agricultural land and forest land without tree cover there should not be worries about negative impacts. Nevertheless, possible increase of spruce culture establishment in the future creates a need for further research in substitution and conversion techniques into autochthonous climatogenic tree species forests under the natural Principles of forest and site management.

AB  - In the Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme (JOVA) runoff, losses of suspended solids and nutrients are measured. In the Skuterud (680 ha) and Mordre (450 ha) catchments, soil erosion from agricultural land is considered to be the major source of particles. Information about agricultural practices on each field is collected to relate losses of particles to e.g. the area ploughed at the time of runoff. In spite of there being less area tilled than normal in the autumn 2000, soil losses were 5-6 higher than mean values for the 10-year monitoring period (1991/1993-2001). Autumn precipitation was 2-3 times higher and runoff 3-5 times higher than normal. A field inventory documented that not only tillage contributed to soil losses, but also preferential flow, erosion around hydrotechnical installations and especially bank erosion. It illustrates the need to have methods for tracing all sources of sediment for the planning of conservation measures.

AB  - Addressing sustainability in urban planning has led to an increasing number of certification systems to support such processes. Nevertheless, there is no commonly recognised framework listing what is important to consider when developing such systems. Citylab is a certification system that is used in several Swedish urban development projects. Today, Citylab certifies the planning process of urban areas but it will be extended with a post-construction part. This paper presents a three steps analysis of the design of such a post-construction certification system. First, a literature review was performed, which allowed for identifying three principles and 11 sub-principles that make up a generic framework for the design of similar certification systems. Second, 13 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Sweden with key urban development stakeholders to better specify the scope of a post-construction extension of Citylab. As a result, four alternatives emerge for the role and function of this system. Third, crossing the results of both previous steps allowed for an understanding of important considerations and implications for the Citylab post-construction certification system design. The paper concludes on the relevance of such a reflexive procedure for the design of certification systems in general, in which the use of the framework is a key to ensure transparency and enable deliberate choices and priorities.

AB  - Global climate change is a major threat to biodiversity, posing increasing pressures on species to adapt in situ or shift their ranges. A protected area network is one of the main instruments to alleviate the negative impacts of climate change. Importantly, protected area networks might be expected to enhance the resilience of regional populations of species of conservation concern, resulting in slower species loss in landscapes with a significant amount of protected habitat compared to unprotected landscapes. Based on national bird atlases compiled in 1974-1989 and 2006-2010, this study examines the recent range shifts in 90 forest, mire, marshland, and Arctic mountain heath bird species of conservation concern in Finland, as well as the changes in their species richness in protected versus unprotected areas. The trends emerging from the atlas data comparisons were also related to the earlier study dealing with predictions of distributional changes for these species for the time slice of 2051-2080, developed using bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs). Our results suggest that the observed changes in bird distributions are in the same direction as the BEM-based predictions, resulting in a decrease in species richness of mire and Arctic mountain heath species and an increase in marshland species. The patterns of changes in species richness between the two time slices are in general parallel in protected and unprotected areas. However, importantly, protected areas maintained a higher level of species richness than unprotected areas. This finding provides support for the significance and resilience provision of protected area networks in preserving species of conservation concern under climate change.

AB  - Logging history and the study of reference conditions in Scandinavian boreal forests has tended to focus on Scots pine dominated ecosystems. This paper presents a regional study of pre-industrial forest conditions and examines the effects of the industrial exploitation of ecosystems dominated by Not-way spruce in northern Sweden. Historical records covering a period which preceded industrial logging in the study area (1917-1927) were used to obtain quantitative data on forest structure and influence of forest fires. These data were compared with a modern data set (2003) to analyse changes due to the industrial transformation of the forest. The early 20th century landscape was dominated by old, multi-cohorted spruce forests and mixed coniferous forests. It was found that fire affected both the structure and composition of the landscape. In post-burnt areas, even-aged forests dominated by deciduous species were the principal forest type. Between the early and modern data sets, profound changes in tree-species composition and age structure were documented. While the total volume of deciduous species increased substantially, the coverage of forests dominated by deciduous species decreased. There was also a significant increase in pine-dominated forests and in the total volume of pine. The industrial transformation of the studied landscapes has had profound effects oil the structure of spruce forests, but much less so oil deciduous forests. The study concludes that the present forest structure is a function of past management regimes, and that future transformations of the landscape will continue, thus affecting the natural variability and biodiversity of the forests.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel concept of territorial fitting for the analysis of the functioning of small farms in broader food, environmental, and socio-economic systems. We elaborate on the framing and definition of territorial fitting (TF) in relation to other concepts, such as territorial and social embeddedness, nested markets and territorial governance. Based on an analysis of empirical manifestations of territorial fitting as found in sample studies of small farms in Latvia, Portugal, and Norway we determine dimensions of territorial fitting such as natural resources, integrated landscape, social ties, and economic ties. Our approach to the identification and articulation of TF is characteristic of exploratory studies that attempt to conceptualise emerging findings. The study suggests that TF works by: (i) improving integration in niche markets and regional food systems; (ii) supporting micro-management of nature and eco-systems; (iii) connecting fields of activity, like agriculture, forestry, rural and environmental services; and (iv) establishing new territorial linkages. We argue that the concept of territorial fitting has the potential for further research on the role of small farms in food systems.

AB  - Woodland key habitats (WKHs) represent a potentially cost-efficient means to protect biodiversity in managed forests. The Forest Act of Finland defines 13 habitat types of WKHs, which enjoy legal protection. It has been argued that WKHs are too small-sized and scattered in occurrence to be actually important in the maintenance of forest biodiversity. However, from the species' perspective. WKHs form a network together with nature reserves. We evaluated the value and role of WKHs as a part of the whole reserve network using a graph-theoretical connectivity approach in three areas (ca. 500 km(2) each) located in Central Finland. The networks were formed separately for different habitat types and dispersal distances (ranging from 200 m to 25 km). We compared networks with and without WKHs, and thereby quantified the contribution of WKHs to overall network connectivity. We also examined the role of WKHs in the networks based on patch importance and network centrality measures. The results showed that the connectivity contributions of WKHs are tightly linked with the dispersal abilities of threatened species: WKHs enhance habitat connectivity, especially for species with an intermediate dispersal ability. For species with a poor dispersal ability, the protection of large set-asides would be a more efficient way to increase habitat connectivity than WKHs. WKH-based conservation seems to improve the connectivity of naturally rare and scattered habitat types relatively more than common habitat types, but in sparse networks a greater dispersal ability is required to gain enhanced connectivity than in dense ones. The connectivity value of WKHs can be understood as an emergent and scale-dependent property, appearing at the level of the entire functional network. Provided that the site characteristics of WKHs can be safeguarded, they can be a valuable and efficient addition to the reserve network. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of marine conservation, trawl fishing activity is the most important ecosystem stressor in demersal Med-iterranean waters. Limited management measures in bottom trawling have caused deep-sea stocks of the iconic Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus to decrease over the last decade. This crustacean acts as an umbrella species for co-existing megafauna. Here, we used non-invasive Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video-surveys to investigate the status of a pilot deep-sea no-take reserve implemented in the northwestern Mediterranean by quantifying demo-graphic indicators of Norway lobsters and the co-existing benthic community, seafloor restoration, and the presence of marine litter. The results revealed that in the no-take reserve the Norway lobster stock showed higher abundance and biomass, and slightly larger body sizes than in the control area without fishing prohibition. Some taxa, such as the fishes Helicolenus dactylopterus and Trigla lyra and anemones of the family Cerianthidae, increased in abundance. We also observed that all trawling marks were smoothed and most of the seafloor was intact, clear indicators of the recovery of the muddy seafloor. The accumulation of marine debris and terrestrial vegetation was similar in the no-take reserve and the fished area. On the basis of the results of this study, we suggest that the use of no-take reserves might be an effective measure for recovering the Norway lobster stock, its co-existing megafauna community, and the surrounding demersal habitat. We also suggest that ROV video-survey might be a useful, and non-invasive method to monitor megafauna and seafloor status in protected deep-sea environments.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers can increase biodiversity by creating novel habitat supporting species that would otherwise be absent. Their more routine activities further influence the biota occupying engineered habitats. Beavers are well-known for transforming ecosystems through dam building and are therefore increasingly being used for habitat restoration, adaptation to climate extremes and in long-term rewilding. Abandoned beaver ponds (BP) develop into meadows or forested wetlands that differ fundamentally from other terrestrial habitats and thus increase landscape diversity. Active BP, by contrast, are superficially similar to other non-engineered shallow wetlands, but ongoing use and maintenance might affect how BP contribute to aquatic biodiversity. We explored the 'within-habitat' effect of an ecosystem engineer by comparing active BP in southern Sweden with coexisting other wetlands (OW), using sedentary (plants) and mobile (water beetles) organisms as indicators. BP differed predictably from OW in environmental characteristics and were more heterogeneous. BP supported more plant species at plot (+15%) and site (+33%) scales, and plant beta diversity, based on turnover between plots, was 17% higher than in OW, contributing to a significantly larger species pool in BP (+17%). Beetles were not differentiated between BP and OW based on diversity measures but were 26% more abundant in BP. Independent of habitat creation beaver are thus significant agents of within-habitat heterogeneity that differentiates BP from other standing water habitat; as an integral component of the rewilding of wetlands re-establishing beaver should benefit aquatic biodiversity across multiple scales.

AB  - The Swedish wolf population has rebounded from near extinction in the 1960s to around 365 individuals in 2020, after the implementation of the Hunting Act (jaktlagen) in 1966. This recent increase in the wolf population has evoked a serious divide between "pro-wolf" and "anti-wolf" Swedish citizens. Despite the continuous efforts by the Swedish government to reconcile this antagonism, the conflicts are persistent with a sign of impasse. In this paper, we present a modelling tool, which can bring transparent and "structured dialogue to the opposing positions." This approach includes a stylized framework for quantitative modelling of stakeholders' satisfaction levels regarding their preferred size of the wildlife population in question, based on the concept of satisfaction functions. We argue that this framework may contribute to conflict resolution by bringing a common understanding among stakeholders, facilitate a societal discourse, and potentially help to assess likely support for conservation policies. We present a showcase application of this modeling tool in the context of the conflict over the Swedish wolf conservation policies. The model is informed using a thorough literature review as well as interviews, which identified relevant stakeholder groups and respective drivers of their attitudes towards wolves.

The aim of the article is to point out the ways in which strategies employed by agencies responsible for monitoring rural landscapes interact with the ideas and knowledge of local people. It will provide evidence from field work in the region to demonstrate that, firstly, the programmes employed and enforced by national agencies are shaped by a particular understanding of environmental history, and secondly, that the interaction with rural labourers and farmers is weak, leading to a neglect of information and support which might otherwise make these programmes far more effective.

AB  - Knowledge about the nutrient and carbon budgets in forest soils is essential to maintain sustainable production, but also in several environmental issues, such as acidification, eutrophication and climate change. The budgets are strongly influenced by atmospheric deposition as well as forestry.
   This study demonstrates how budget calculations for nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and base cations (BC) can be used as a basis for policy decisions on a regional level in Sweden. The study was based on existing nutrient and C budget calculations on a regional scale in Sweden. The nutrient budgets have been calculated for each square in a national 5 km x 5 km net by means of mass balances including deposition, harvest losses, leaching, weathering (BC) and fixation (N). Scenarios with different deposition and forestry intensity have been run and illustrated on maps. A simplified C budget has been estimated by multiplying the N accumulation with the C/N ratio in the organic layer, based on the assumption that the C/N ratio in the accumulating organic matter is equal to the ratio in the soil organic matter pool. The budget approaches differ from earlier budget studies since they involve regional high resolution data, combine deposition and forestry scenarios and integrate different environmental aspects. The results indicate that whole-tree harvesting will cause net losses of N and base cations in large parts of Sweden, which means that forestry will not be sustainable unless nutrients are added through compensatory fertilization. To prevent net losses following whole-tree harvesting, compensatory fertilization of base cations would be required in almost the whole country, whereas N fertilization would be needed mainly in the northern half of Sweden.
   The results further suggest that today's recommendations for N fertilization should be revised in southern Sweden by applying the southwest-northeast gradient of the N budget calculations. The C and N accumulation calculations show that C sequestration in Swedish forest soils is not an effective or sustainable way to decrease the net carbon dioxide emissions. A better way is to apply whole-tree harvesting and use the branches, tops and needles as biofuel replacing fossil fuels. This could reduce the present carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels substantially.
   The study shows that high resolution budget calculations that illuminate different aspects of sustainability in forest ecosystems are important tools for identifying problem areas, investigating different alternatives through scenario analyses and developing new policies. Cooperation with stakeholders increases the probability that the research will be useful. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB  - Recreational fishing has become an important part of the Norwegian tourist industry. The coastal municipality of Risor, southern Norway, is considering further development of its marine fishing tourism to increase local economic benefits, but they also want to limit negative effects on the local ecosystem and for the inhabitants. We developed an integrated model with ecosystem and socioeconomic components to evaluate these trade-offs. We chose the status of the local cod (Gadus morhua) stock as an indicator of the marine ecosystem condition. Cod is a highly valued species in tourist and recreational fisheries throughout Norway, and also supports an important commercial fishery. Five management scenarios are presented and compared to the status quo. Our research illustrates how an ecosystem model can assist local authorities in making rational coastal zone management decisions. Our study also revealed a lack of management instruments for local authorities to develop natural resource-based tourism in Norway, and thus the need for the municipality to cooperate and coordinate with other management units and levels.

AB  - We present the first gridded and temporally continuous quantitative pollen-based plant-cover reconstruction for temperate and northern subtropical China over the Holocene (11.7 ka to present) obtained by applying the Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model. The objective is to provide a dataset of pollen-based land cover for the last ca. 12 millennia that is suitable for palaeoclimate modelling and for the evaluation of simulated past vegetation cover from dynamic vegetation models and anthropogenic land-cover change (ALCC) scenarios. The REVEALS reconstruction was achieved using 94 selected pollen records from lakes and bogs at a 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial scale and a temporal resolution of 500 years between 11.7 and 0.7 ka and in three recent time windows (0.7-0.35 ka, 0.35-0.1 ka, and 0.1 ka to present). The dataset includes REVEALS estimates of cover and their standard errors (SEs) for 27 plant taxa in 75 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells distributed within the study region. The 27 plant taxa were also grouped into 6 plant functional types and 3 land-cover types (coniferous trees CT, broadleaved trees BT, and C-3 herbs/open land (C3H/OL)), and their REVEALS estimates of cover and related SEs were calculated. We describe the protocol used for the selection of pollen records and the REVEALS application (with parameter settings) and explain the major rationales behind the protocol. As an illustration, we present, for eight selected time windows, gridded maps of the pollen-based REVEALS estimates of cover for the three land-cover types (CT, BT, and C3H/OL). We then discuss the reliability and limitations of the Chinese dataset of Holocene gridded REVEALS plant cover, and its current and potential uses.
   The dataset is available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Li, 2022; ).

KW  - Norway
AB  - Both in a national and global context, it is challenging to identify key conditions for the integration of sustainable tourism in public policy. By studying a number of recent planning processes pertaining to tourism development, this article aims to contribute recent insight into how sustainability may be integrated into tourism planning. The study was motivated by a publicized shift in the Norwegian government policy strategy on sustainable tourism, from a sector approach to an integration approach. Through case analysis, the concept of environmental policy integration is applied. Findings show that sustainable tourism is partially integrated in all cases and three key issues are outlined. First, although Norway is characterized by a high degree of sector organization, it has a weak structure for overall tourism policy integration. Second, the integration of sustainable tourism has been stimulated by national horizontal integration, bottom-up integration prepared by institutional changes, public participation, and by active use of the municipal system of planning. Third, this study could not find any evidence for the announced shift from a sector approach to an integrated approach to sustainable tourism.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst. (L.)) in the boreal zone can be managed as even-aged or uneven-aged stands, or be grown with no management at all. Here, we investigated how these management options affect carbon dynamics, particularly the carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem (trees and soil), and albedo, and their combined effect on radiative forcing compared to a reference case, clear-cut site before planting seedlings. This allowed us to assess the potential of different management regimes to mitigate global warming. We ran long-term simulations under the current climate on a sub-mesic site in central Finland (62 degrees N) using an eco-physiological forest-ecosystem model. Compared to even-aged management, no management (old-growth forest) increased ecosystem carbon stocks by 47 per cent and decreased albedo by 15 per cent, whereas uneven-aged management reduced ecosystem carbon stocks by 16 per cent and increased albedo by 10 per cent. Only the no management option resulted in a significant net cooling effect whereas for even-aged and uneven-aged management, the opposing effects of changes in albedo and carbon stocks largely cancelled each other with little remaining net effect. On the other hand, the latter one even made a small net warming contribution. Overall, maintaining higher ecosystem carbon stocks implied the larger cooling benefits. This was evident even though lower albedo enhanced radiation absorption, and thus warming. Increasing use of the no management option by forest owners may require proper incentives such as compensation for lost harvest incomes.

AB  - We conducted two studies on how highways affect their adjacent habitats by sampling carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in patches of formerly continuous forest next to highways. (1) We sampled carabids at 14 highway intersections near Helsinki, Finland. Each intersection (constructed 2-40 years ago) had two forested patches to study: a remnant (0.5-37.4 ha) and, isolated from the remnant by an intersection lane, an islet (size 0.2-1.8 ha). Pitfall trap catch data (2301 carabids, 25 species) showed that remnants hosted higher catches of three carabid species, and slightly higher species richness, than islets (patch-size effect). Time since intersection construction had no apparent effect on carabids. Traffic volume along the intersection lane determined the assemblage structure of carabids in dry patches, and the abundance of a forest carabid Calathus micropterus. Compared to moist patches, drier patches hosted lower catches of four generalist species; they also had different assemblages of carabids (habitat-type effect). An interaction between patch size and habitat type for a forest generalist Pterostichus oblongopunctatus indicated that the patch-size effect was dependent on habitat type. (2) We examined possible dispersal of carabids among forested patches that were separated by highway lanes in Drenthe, the Netherlands. We released 2696 marked individuals of 10 species, and recaptured 376 using dry pitfall traps. We found no evidence for inter-patch movement for nine forest species, but 22 of 225 recaptured individuals of Poecilus versicolor, an eurytopic open-habitat species, had crossed the highway. Catches of seven forest species were also significantly lower in the road verges, compared to the adjacent forests. These two studies suggest that (i) decreasing patch size negatively affects forest-carabid catch and overall species richness, (ii) habitat type can affect the intensity of the patch-size effect, (iii) carabid assemblages of forest fragments vary with traffic volume (which may be linked with urbanization), (iv) forest carabids rarely cross highways, and (v) open habitats associated with road margins are dispersal barriers for forest carabids.

AB  - Knowledge-based' approaches have recently made a breakthrough in urban planning. How to develop balance in knowledge-based planning between abstract and scientific knowledge, on the one hand, and 'local knowledge' on the other hand has been long debated. To this debate, we add a form of knowledge with potential for sustainable urban planning, i.e. ethnographic knowledge that could transmit an understanding of urban dwellers' daily practices and values to planning organisations. Theoretical literature is the foundation of our argument, which we illustrate with a case study involving urban planners and decision-makers in the Helsinki region of Finland.

AB  - To investigate the effects of commercial forestry, on canopy-living invertebrates in the boreal forest, we sampled branches in northern Sweden for invertebrates and lichens from paired natural spruce Picea abies forests and adjacent managed forests that were selectively logged The study was conducted during late winter, when invertebrate abundance is lowest, and when small differences may be critical to foraging birds.
   Natural forests had significantly gr eater invertebrate diversity than managed forests and nearly five times as many invertebrates per branch. The number of large invertebrates (> 25 mm, the minimum prey size for foraging passerine birds) was consistently higher in natural forests, with spiders (Araneae), Lepidoptera and Diptera larvae dominating. The number and biomass of invertebrates were related to the abundance of lichens even after controlling for sampling location and branch size. Other studies have implicated forestry in the decline of nonmigratory passerine birds in northern Europe through the destruction and fragmentation of forests, but our study indicates that it may also reduce foraging habitat quality through a reduction in lichen abundance.

AB  - Effects of different land-use types on nutrient and chemical run-off have been widely researched, but the total effect of changes in land use on communities of aquatic species is poorly known. We evaluated the effect of land-use change on waterfowl communities of boreal lakes. We conducted the study with topographic maps and GIS-techniques in central Finland. We compared changes in the structure of waterfowl communities with changes in land use around 15 lakes over a period of 50 years. Over the period, agricultural land and bogs were reduced in area, while ditched areas increased significantly. The numbers of waterfowl breeding pairs and species increased slightly on the majority of lakes. The largest increases in breeding pairs were for Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Teal Alias crecca. Interestingly, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos decreased in terms of both breeding pairs and the number of occupied lakes, although it has increased nationally. We found evidence of decreasing pair numbers of Mallards on lakes where adjacent dwellings increased in number. Changes in land use correlated with those in waterfowl communities but lake size appears to affect these results. After controlling for the effect of lake size, only the number of adjacent dwellings correlated significantly with changes in the number of breeding pairs of Mallards. According to our results, changes in the area of agricultural, bog or ditched land around lakes could not be clearly linked with changes in waterfowl communities.

AB  - Trail damage and vegetation loss due to recreation activities is an increasing problem in many natural areas. Managing ecological impacts through the selection of indicators and standards is a key component of developing a sustainable tourism industry, a process that appropriately is based on the judgment of different stakeholder groups. This study investigates stakeholder consensus regarding trail impacts and management preferences in the Norwegian community of Lom and the surrounding region. Evaluations are compared across three groups; tourists, residents with tourism-related income, and other residents. Results show a fairly high tolerance for trail impacts across stakeholder groups. Differences are more noticeable with respect to management actions that might be used to reduce ecological impacts, with tourists generally being more supportive of actions. Results suggest that consensus on relevant indicators and standards may be achieved relatively easily, but agreement on management actions may be more difficult.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has been applied and studied across various domains, including the tourism sector. This article endeavors to uncover the key contributions from the scientific literature regarding sustainable tourism development in the present century. To achieve this, a comprehensive bibliographic search was conducted, focusing on the themes of sustainable development and tourism, utilizing the Web of Science (WoS) database. This search yielded a list of 496 documents, which were subsequently subjected to analysis using the VOSviewer software, including diverse analytical methods and units of analysis. The primary findings of this study reveal the predominance of Australia in terms of the highest number of citations and China in the number of published documents. Finnish researcher Jarkko Saarinen emerges as the most frequently cited author, while Colin Michael Hall from New Zealand is the most co-cited author. In the context of keyword analysis, three thematic groups were identified: (1) rural tourism, reflecting a tourism sector closely linked to environmental aspects; (2) management, with a heightened emphasis on tourism as a business activity; and (3) sustainable tourism development, advocating for a balance among economic, social, and environmental dimensions. These findings are further complemented by the emergence of three prominent themes: governance, innovation, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The article suggests a more in-depth exploration of these thematic areas, particularly in terms of how sustainability can be incorporated as a focal point for development, thus alleviating the adverse impacts of tourism on destinations.

TI  - Managing the environmental effects of the Norwegian oil and gas industry: From conflict to consensus
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - In the early days of exploitation of the oil resources on Norway's continental shelf there was little control over environmental impacts. The oil companies expected effects of their activities to be found to a 1 km radius round platforms. In the late 1980s data started appearing that suggested that effects were over much larger areas. These findings were disputed but subsequent studies showed that a more realistic figure of the area affected was a 3 km radius giving roughly 10 times the area predicted by the companies. The Norwegian authorities reacted by imposing restrictions on discharges of oil-based drilling cuttings and since 1993 oil-based drilling mud or cuttings have not been intentionally discharged to sea on the Norwegian shelf. In 1996 Norway changed its offshore monitoring from field based monitoring of sediments to a regional monitoring of both sediments and the water column, The change makes it possible to obtain a better overview of the environmental conditions, at the same time it also reduces costs for the operators.

AB  - The article examines a phenomenon associated with the rural idyll - the dream of becoming the owner of a smallholding in the countryside. Much research and policy concern in Norway have focused upon rural-urban migration trends and the consequences of the urbanisation process on the sustainability of rural communities. Less attention has been given to the counter trend, that is, urban dwellers searching for a better quality of life in the countryside. The article is based on data from a Norwegian national survey and analyses a question measuring respondents' interest in buying a smallholding. The analysis involves an estimation of a regression model to determine which demographic, socioeconomic and attitudinal variables influence people's interest in buying a smallholding. Further, we were interested in their plans for the smallholding (farming, residence, second home) and the kind of influences these potential new smallholding owners might have on rural communities. Three categories of potential smallholders are identified: aspiring farmers, country-life lovers and recreation seekers. The results indicate that those who live in urban areas are more interested in buying a smallholding than those already living in rural areas.

AB  - The amount of rented farmland in Norway has increased steadily since the 1950s. Concerns have been raised questioning whether farmland is treated less well by tenants compared to landowners. This study aims to investigate how farmers perceive their treatment of rented farmland, which factors impact their decision-making related to this and if farmers are concerned about farmland elements that are less important for productivity but mainly of interest for cultural heritage or environmental management reasons. Semi-structured interviews with a group of randomly selected farmers were carried out in an area dominated by intensive agriculture. Independent of, for example, amount of rented land or duration of the rental agreement, all farmers agreed that rented land was treated well. A strong competition for farmland in combination with farmers being dependent on renting land was the most important reason. Results from this study may be transferrable to other farming areas, at least where competition for farmland is comparable. We do suggest, however, that any further research on treatment of rented farmland in Norway should take a regional approach, since national statistics may cover significant regional differences.

AB  - The blue bioeconomy is gaining momentum in EU policy debate and various national government strategies as a pathway towards a more sustainable society. Linked to the circularity of economic processes, it combines the promise of (regional) economic development with a sustainable, bio-based transition focused on increased and novel utilisation of aquatic resources. Nonetheless, portrayed as a holistic approach, the political visions of blue bioeconomy reside predominantly in marine environments with little integration of freshwater perspectives or alternative development paths. Rooted in concepts of policy mobility, assembling processes and the positionalities of involved entities, this paper displays two regionally embedded blue bioeconomy developments - Norwegian coastal seaweed farming and Finnish lake fisheries - and their spatially diverse reconnections with national and international policy narratives. By framing a freshwater and a coastal marine case, and their spatial reconnections with an overarching yet diversely translated policy realm, the paper taps into the multiple ontologies of water in blue bioeconomy governance and presents initial empirical and methodological steps towards a relational understanding of its governance processes. Based on four key topical reconnections, the article points to a variety of challenging mismatches between policy narratives, local development processes and potentials. It also suggests conceptual and methodological implications of this approach for further research into "blue" resource governance.

AB  - In this article, we aim to understand how planning theory and practice should approach new urban entities and their transforming meanings. We argue that planning practice has difficulties in identifying and recognising developmental processes where the human attachment to the local environment gradually changes the identity and use of an area. Instead, these processes are interpreted as disruptions in the planned course of action. We illustrate our viewpoint with an empirical example from Finland. The case is about a significant spot of biodiversity in a completely man-made environment. The study serves as an example of how artefacts actively co-shape the events and environment around them and thus create a relationship between humans and their surroundings. Drawing on a science and technology studies-inspired perspective on the relationships between human and non-human actors, we stress the importance of artefacts, local setting and processual development in urban planning.

AB  - We quantified the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and biodiversity of boreal forests on acidic soils and created a statistically supported rational set of indicators to monitor the stand onaturalnesso. For that, we surveyed various traits of tree layer, understory, herb layer, forest floor and several widely accepted biodiversity epiphytic indicators in 252 old-aged boreal stands in Estonia, mostly dominated by Scots pine or Norway spruce. Multifactorial general linear model analyses showed that many forest characteristics and potential indicators were confounded by the gradient of soil productivity (reflected by the forest site type), local biogeographic gradients and also by stand age. Considering confounding effects, boreal forests in a near-natural state have more large-diameter trees (diameter at breast height 40 cm) and larger variety of diameter classes, higher proportion of spruce or deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris in various stages, a more closed tree canopy and denser understory than managed mature forests. By increasing light availability above the field layer, forest management indirectly increases the coverage of herbs and lichens on the forest floor but reduces the alpha- and beta-diversity of herbs and the proportion of graminoids. Human disturbances reduce the relative incidence of many commonly accepted biodiversity indicators such as indicator lichens, woodpeckers, wood-dwelling insects or fungi on trees. The test for the predictive power of characteristics reacting on disturbance revealed that only a fraction of them appeared to be included in a diagnostic easy-to-apply set of indicators to assess the nature quality of boreal forest: the amount of dead wood, the proportion of deciduous trees, the presence of specially shaped trees and woodpeckers and, as an indicator of disturbances, the forest herb Melampyrum pratensis. Many of these indicators have already been implemented in practice.

AB  - Where large landscape modifications are planned, e.g. for infrastructure or exploitation, ecological impact assessments are required because of their potential effects on environment and species. Methods that make such assessments more standardized, efficient, and reliable are highly desirable. This paper proposes a new connectivity-based habitat model for bats (PREBAT), which could be used as a tool for impact assessments. Using data that was specifically collected for this purpose, the performance of PREBAT is critically analyzed and discussed. For this study, 50 sites within an area of 850 km(2) in eastern Sweden were inventoried for four nights each using automatic ultrasound recorders to get an empiric measure of bat occurrence that could be compared with PREBAT predictions. The correlation between the predicted values from PREBAT and the observed bat activity (number of recordings) or species richness was tested using generalized linear mixed models. Predicted values of PREBAT are significantly correlated to the number of species that regularly (more than one night) occur at a given site, but not to the total number of species. PREBAT performed also much better at predicting the activity of forest-living species than overall bat activity, which makes PREBAT particularly suitable for predicting conflicts for those species. This study proposes a new habitat model for bats that takes spatial connectivity between habitat patches into account. PREBAT is shown to perform satisfyingly and has the potential to become a useful tool in assessing the ecological impact of large-scale landscape modifications.

AB  - eGovernment continues to be an interesting area of study, especially since it is not simply about the implementation of ICTs, but rather, as this paper will show, about a larger change management process. When trying to understand the factors behind successful examples of eGovernment in the context of change management, most research so far focuses on the implementation phase in a literal sense and not on the planning phase, that precedes the implementation phase, or the evaluation phase that follows. This paper aims at remedying this by focusing on the planning phase; the development of an eGovernment strategy and vision, which is the departing point for a future implementation process. Through an in-depth case study of the work done at a Swedish municipality, the city of Vasteras, this paper aims at answering the question: "Which are the key change management aspects of an eGovernment planning process?" By focusing on the planning phase of eGovernment in a Swedish municipality, this paper develops the knowledge and understanding of this kind of endeavour. Even if ICTs can be seen as a means to modernize government, technology alone cannot break down organizational and cultural barriers - something that is necessary in order for the full benefits of eGovernment to be realized. The paper is hence primarily empirical in contribution. However, this paper also provides useful insights on the planning process for eGovernment and necessary aspects when creating an eGovernment strategy.

AB  - The areal extent of Zostera marina in the archipelago of the Swedish Skagerrak has decreased by 60% over two decades. To investigate the effects of Z. marina loss on the local fish assemblages, the fish fauna was compared between existing seagrass beds and sites where seagrass had vanished. A field study was carried out at four shallow locations in the outer archipelago of the coast in June 2004. Within each location two sites were sampled, one with an existing Z. marina bed and another where Z. marina had disappeared. Fish were sampled semi-quantitatively with a beach seine. Samples were taken during both day and night and captured fish were examined to species, enumerated and measured in the field, and released thereafter. The number of fish species was found to be significantly higher in Z. marina habitats compared to areas where seagrass was missing, and density and biomass of fish were generally lower in areas dominated by bare sediment compared to those in the seagrass habitats. Several species and groups of fishes (i.e., gadoids, labrids, syngnathids) were absent or occurred in low densities at sites where Z. marina was missing. For example, juvenile 0-group cod density was reduced by 96% at sites where Z. marina had disappeared. Such a reduction in recruitment of cod is in the same order of magnitude as the combined effect of seal predation and mortality due to by-catches in the eel fyke-net fishery estimated for the archipelago of the Swedish Skagerrak. Hence, the results clearly indicate a shift in the fish assemblage, including a loss of taxa at the family level as a result of degradation in habitat-forming vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to showcase how Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) can be used to assist in collecting data of relevance for planning at a tourism destination in general and, specifically how PPGIS data can assist in the early stages of transportation planning. In this paper, we report on a PPGIS study in Salenfjallen, the largest ski tourism destination in Sweden. Our analysis uses data from 162 visitors sampled on-site using online and paper-based questionnaires containing survey questions and mapping tasks. We use the survey and mapped results from Salenfjallen to discuss the opportunities and challenges of using PGGIS for this planning purpose. We conclude that, despite of various challenges like low response rates and sampling issues, PPGIS provides the possibility to collect rich information in terms of survey results and mapped values. This is important in understanding a transportation challenge at the early stages of planning, namely the initiation stage. Our study adds to a growing literature exploring the use of PPGIS in the field of tourism and recreation. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first to use this approach in a tourism-transport context in a Nordic destination.

AB  - The widely used term 'mass tourism' is often considered as a self-explanatory concept that refers to an unpleasant and an overcrowded form of tourism. Nevertheless, contemporary mass tourism is a complex phenomenon and different actors within the tourism industry conceptualize it in different ways. In this study, mass tourism is understood to be socially constructed and negotiated through discursive practices. This is a case study that analyses how Finnish travel agents of mass package tour operators engage with mass tourism. The discourse analysis of pair-interviews is focused on the attitudes and aims of agents' responses. For the travel agents interviewed, the term 'mass' evoked outsider perspective, negative meanings and was mostly considered as a historical and taken-for-granted category. Through practical examples of package tourism, they challenged the stereotypes of 'mass tourism'. Package tourism was illustrated through discourses of restriction, possibility and dynamism, whereas mass tourism was articulated through discourses of scale, negatively distinguishable, cultural tradition and uncertainty. I argue that personal experiences or embodied practices and open-minded attitudes are key issues in understanding the 'truths' of package tourism. Mass tourism is not a static but dynamic and multifaceted concept. Thus, further research on mass tourism focusing on the relationship between discursive practices and experiences is needed.

AB  - Question A warming climate has been linked to changes in the distribution of many species, yet the interactions between climate and other environmental drivers are relatively poorly understood. Mountain regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate, and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant communities? Location Southern Scandes, Norway. Methods We use a unique long-term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions. Results We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational advance than species from higher altitudes. Conclusions This study presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the potential to buffer climate-driven shifts in plant communities. Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the vulnerability of alpine communities to warming.

AB  - Wind and waves are major forces affecting the geomorphology and biota in coastal areas. We present a generally applicable method for measuring and calculating fetch length, fetch direction and wave exposure. Fetch length and direction, measured by geographic information system-based methods, are used along with wind direction and wind speed data to estimate wave height and period by applying forecasting curves. The apparent power of waves approaching the shore, used as a proxy for wave exposure, is then calculated by a linear wave model. We demonstrate our method by calculating fetch lengths and wave exposure indices for five areas with varying exposure levels and types of meteorological conditions in the Finnish Archipelago Sea, situated in the northern Baltic Sea. This method is a rapid and accurate means of estimating exposure, and is especially applicable in areas with geomorphologically varying and complicated shorelines. We expect that our method will be useful in several fields, such as basic biogeographical and biodiversity research, as well as coastal land-use planning and management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A pragmatic and polity-focused solution for governing a smart city in the direction of sustainability is still missing in theory and practice. A debate about whether a smart city is a pragmatic solution for modern challenges or just a technology-led urban utopia is entangled with the vexed issue of governance. While 'smart governance' has drawn unprecedented interest, the combination of its conceptual vagueness and broad applications couple with a lack of focus on its underlying international and local political paradigms have raised concerns about its utility. This study contributes to restoring attention to the original concept of governance, its differences with governing and government, and the potential challenges resulting from its functionality in its real, multi-layered, and complex contexts. This paper explores the intellectual connection between governance and smart cities, from both an empirical and a conceptual/analytical perspective. From the empirical side, we examine which actors, processes, and relational mechanisms at different levels that have had an impact on the initiation of smart cities in three Norwegian cities: Trondheim, Bergen, and Bodo. We illustrate how the structural sources of the interests, roles, and power in smart city initiatives have caused governance to emerge and change, but have also affected the goals designed by specific actors.

AB  - The forest sector has played a crucial role in Finland's national economy. The objective of this paper is to discuss the adaptation of the ideas of scientific forest management practices to Finnish private forestry and the reactions of the private forest owners. The key concepts are forest management by the selection system and devastation of the forests.
   The conflict between private forest owners and the forestry boards, representing scientific forest management, was entangled around these concepts and their interpretation throughout the period from the 1920s to the 1980s. This conflict is illustrated through a concrete example at the municipal level. The analysis is based on documents related to infringements of the law concerning private forests. The authorities and scientists used forest improvement acts, the first of which was introduced in the late 1920s, to promote their mission of intensifying wood production, and by this means the private forest owners who favoured 'traditional' methods of managing their forests were pushed into following the instructions of the forest authorities. Thus the interests and needs of private forest owners were bypassed in forestry planning. The strict interpretation of the Private Forests Act enabled the forest sector to achieve its goal, but it went too far in the intensification of forestry in the 1960s and 1970s. The 'rebellion' against intensive forestry in the early 1980s was a clear reflection of the need to take the forest owners' diverse wishes into account as well in matters of forest management.

AB  - Forest loss and fragmentation induces harmful ecological effects especially for species preferring mature forests. The Eurasian Treecreeper, Certhia familiaris, is highly specialised in foraging on large tree trunks and can only occasionally forage outside of mature forests. We quantified nest defence behaviour of Treecreeper parents toward a stuffed model of Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major in central Finland. We used a Geographical Information System (GIS) to measure the landscape structure within a 200 in radius around the nest. We found that females with more fledged offspring gave alarm calls from farther away from the predator model than did females with fewer fledged offspring. The alarming distance of females was longer when the forest patch around the nest was larger. In males, however, alarming distance decreased with increasing home patch size. It seems that forest loss may influence parental nest defence behaviour, which is one of the fundamental life-history traits in birds. The association between habitat characteristics and nest defence behaviour of birds need more attention to understand how human modified habitats affect bird breeding success.

In Finland, which is perceived as a leader in forest bioeconomy, the national bioeconomy strategy was adopted in 2014 and updated in 2022. The Czech and Slovak Republics are following a path towards adopting national forest bioeconomy strategies and have partially adopted bioeconomy principles in other forestry-related strategic documents. The relevant core strategies are, the adoption of the bioeconomy concept in the Czech Republic by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Slovak Republic. The Czech and Slovak Republics have the potential to utilize the forest sector in order to enable development of their forest bioeconomies in the future.

AB  - Responsibility is a key aspect of all regulation, and forest regulation is no exception. How should responsibility be understood and used in a time characterized by complexity and uncertainty? This paper develops a typology that distinguishes six notions of responsibility and then employs it in analyzing interpretations of responsibility in Swedish forestry practice. The Swedish forest management system is a deregulated system structured by the governing principle of "freedom with responsibility." By investigating how responsibility is understood and enacted by forest consultants and forest owners, we demonstrate the practical fluidity of the responsibility concept. We emphasize the need for an understanding of responsibility that fosters sensitivity and adaptiveness to external issues and actors in the face of uncertainty, and identify obstacles in current forestry policy and practice to enacting such an understanding.

AB  - A huge and continuously growing pit is about to divide the Swedish mining town of Malmberget into two halves. What once was the town centre is now a 200 metres deep hole, and private homes and key buildings like the old school and the church have had to be demolished or moved. The pit is a human imposed landscape scar' epitomising the town's lost golden age of mining, its present situation of decline and uncertain future prospects - despite a recent recovery in the mining industry. Although the pit is decisively present in the local community, it is not articulated as significant, especially not from a heritage perspective. Why is this so? In this article, we examine the pit as a potential cultural tool for heritage processes, and find that it is indeed used by individuals in this respect, but not in collective memorialisation. We conclude that landscape scars definitely can constitute critical cultural tools, although they may not always need to be labelled as belonging to an authorized heritage discourse'. Instead, the potential of the landscape scar is to enhance the amount and recognition of shared memories in the local community.

AB  - Hydropower is a highly appreciated climate-friendly source of energy production. However, it has non-negligible negative impacts on the environment and landscape aesthetics where the energy is produced, affecting the recreational interests of the public using the respective local river spaces. The preferences of the local public are increasingly assessed and involved in the planning of mitigation measures for impacted rivers. Aesthetic assessment methods using a common user perspective, i.e., an "on-the-ground " perspective, could potentially be improved by using an aerial perspective facilitated by modern drone technology. Studies on the compatibility of these two perspectives of assessment in terms of public preference elicitation are lacking so far. In river Nea, Norway, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the visual preferences of the local public for different environmental mitigation measures related to weirs, minimum flow, and recreational infrastructure using both perspectives. The results indicate that there exist significant differences in the preferences for scenarios based on the two different visual perspectives, and that a compatibility between them cannot be assumed and therefore requires further investigation. Finally, based on our study setup and previous experience, we outline and propose a standardized procedure for the visualization of mitigation measures as an input to environmental design projects where public perception is incorporated.

AB  - In this article, I investigate ospatial scaleo as an aspect that needs to be more carefully addressed in the discussion and planning of osustainable urban formso. Focusing on the Malmo-Lund region in Sweden, I discuss problems of scale as related to the new take on sustainability in Malmo planning documents, especially the update of the Malmo comprehensive plan from 2005. The article is divided into three sections. First, I discuss the concept and problem of spatial scale, contextualizing it in theory as well as in recent discussions on urban transformations. Second, I briefly discuss the discourse of sustainable urban forms, pointing out some scale-related issues that need to be more carefully addressed. In the third and main section of the article, I investigate plans and projects for urban development in Malmo, focusing and elaborating on spatial scale and discussing the findings in terms of three kinds of scale stabilization: in terms of territory, size and hierarchy. The article concludes with a call for further work for the possibilities of a more dynamic and multi-scalar approach in urban planning.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to discuss about the current situation and development of globalization at the sustainability and logistics points of view and then focus on the challenges presented on the Finnish economy and industry. Finland is relatively big country in Scandinavia with a total area of 338145 km(2) and one of the lowest density in Europe 18 inhabitants per dry land km(2). This causes logistic and also sustainability challenges, which Finnish companies have to deal with in order to be competitive in the global markets - how to compensate the extra cost caused by the 2000 km transportation to the main markets at the central Europe? During the last 60 years the Finnish economy and industry have been strongly dependent on foreign trade surplus. Since 2008 the quantity and value of the Finnish exports has experienced a dramatic change and the sustainability challenges will definitely change the markets further in the ever-globalizing world trade. In the future the Finnish exports industry will be required to face ever tightening productivity and cost efficiency challenges because of automatization, digitalization and low cost production. As the external productivity and costs pressure increases will the Finnish national economics be in turmoil because of chronically deficit national budget. The high living costs do not allow lower salaries without social support financed by government or municipalities. These lower salaries will cut automatically down the tax incomes and the vicious circle is appearing.

AB  - In cities around the world, achieving greater environmental sustainability is increasingly accompanied by economic motivations. This is illustrated in Stockholm, Sweden, Europe's first Green Capital (2010), where an important aspect of the city's contemporary environmental success has been the development and promotion of flagship eco-district projects. Packaging the environmental sustainability and marketability of these development projects has been part of a concerted strategy in Stockholm, one shared by numerous cities around the world. But to what extent can eco-districts contribute to economic growth? Despite implicit policy motivation, a concise approach to connecting and measuring these issues has yet to be established. Based on an examination of two eco-district developments, this paper combines a qualitative commentary consisting of company-specific interviews with and analysis of productivity of regional cleantech firms in an effort to verify the connection between Stockholm's eco-districts and the growth of its cleantech sector. Through this mixed methods approach, promising opportunities to assess the economic impact that eco-districts can have on local eco-innovation sectors have emerged. This type of information can be used to support wider public initiatives in eco-district projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic entailed varying restrictions on access, movement and social behavior in populations around the world. Knowledge about how people coped with "soft-touch" restrictions can inform urban spatial planning strategies that enhance resilience against future pandemics. We analyzed data from an online place based survey on 2845 places across Sweden that respondents abstained from visiting, visited with similar frequency, or visited more frequently in spring 2020 as compared to before the pandemic. In spatial logistic regression models, we relate geographical and sociodemographic properties of places (fields, forests, water, residential population density and daytime population density) to self-perceived changes in wellbeing from visiting the given place less or more often, respectively. Abstaining from visiting places with natural features located in areas of high residential density was associated with a self-perceived negative influence on wellbeing. Yet, fields, forests and water were strongly associated with places people claimed wellbeing benefits from during pandemic restrictions. The further a visited place was from the respondent's home, the more likely it was to have a positive wellbeing influence. As an illustrative case, we map our models onto the landscape of Stockholm, showing that some neighborhoods are likely more resilient than others when coping with pandemic restrictions. Both the most and least resilient neighborhoods span the socio-economic spectrum. Urban planning will do well to enable equitable, easy access to natural settings by foot or bike, to increase pandemic preparedness as well as support climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.

AB  - Macroalgae biomass production, understood as cultivation and harvesting, is a minor industry in Europe at present, but the sector is recognized as having substantial growth potential. Here, we framed the environmental license as a boundary object between business and authorities and investigated the details of macroalgal licensing procedures in seven Northern European countries (Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Ice-land, and Scotland). We conducted surveys and interviews with macroalgae companies and licensing authorities to understand the challenges faced by both sides.Generally, macroalgae production in Northern European countries is regulated by environmental and water laws and is not included in maritime spatial plans. Private actors need to apply for an environmental, water and/ or fishing permit to start operations in this sector, often with several authorities involved. The companies expressed their dissatisfaction with non-specific laws and burdensome licensing procedures that may delay or even prevent the start-up. The authorities highlighted the lack of scientific environmental risk assessments of macroalgae production and the need to resolve possible conflicts with other marine sectors. Companies need the license to access markets while authorities view the license as a tool to enforce environmental legislation. As a boundary object, the license is the result of correspondence and cooperation between companies and authorities. A one-step licensing procedure for macroalgae production should be applied to encourage this business and to facilitate the compliance of legislation. In addition, macroalgae related activities should be recognized in the national maritime spatial plans to facilitate long-term planning.

AB  - Introductions of the pine wood nematode (PWN), which causes Pine Wilt Disease (PWD), have devastating effects on pine forests in regions with susceptible host trees under suitable climate conditions. Norwegian authorities have proposed a contingency plan if PWN is detected in Norway. We compare the costs of implementing this plan with the costs of further spread and damage of PWN under two climate change scenarios: present and the most likely future climate. With the present climate, PWD will not occur in Norway. Under climatic change, the cost of PWD damage is approximately 0.078-0.157 million NOK (0.01-0.02 million Euros) estimated as net present value with 2 and 4% p. a. discount rate. In contrast, the corresponding costs of implementing the suggested contingency plan will be 1.7-2.2 billion NOK (0.2-0.25 billion Euros). These costs are caused by reduced income from industrial timber production and the costs of the eradication measures. Costs related to reduced recreation or biodiversity are expected to be very high, but are not included in the above estimates. Many of the factors in the analysis are burdened with high uncertainty, but sensitivity analyses indicate that the results are rather robust even for drastic changes in assumptions. The results suggest that there is a need to revise the current PWN contingency plan in Norway.

AB  - This study deals with the legal status of maritime cultural heritage (MCH) and maritime spatial planning (MSP) in Russia. One of the main problems is that, in Russia, the MCH, especially when non-archaeological objects of underwater cultural heritage (UCH), do not stand out at the legislative level. UCH is not mentioned in any legal act so far. Currently, several legislative initiatives proposed by the coastal constituent entities of the Baltic Sea are supported by the Marine Board and under consideration by the State Duma of the Russian Federation. It is expected that two proposed laws will be fully adopted by the end of 2020. MCH is not fully integrated into the pilot MSP in Russia. In the frame of the BalticRIM project, all existent MCH data in the Baltic Sea Region (Russian Sectors of the South-Eastern Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland) has been collected and compiled as a database. This database is the first step in integrating MCH into the MSP process; even the latter has no legal status. The Russian case could be an example of including the MCH into the MSP process from the very beginning to have the opportunity to provide key priority areas for MCH, as has been advised by MSP planners. The next step for the Russian case is to develop the new pilot MSP for the Russian Sectors of the Baltic Sea, considering the priority areas for MCH. The analysis of the MSP and MCH legislation in Russia allowed for the development of the proposals and further steps to develop mechanisms for the UCH management of both that which remains on the seabed and items subject to transfer/remove for subsequent storage onshore. These steps should be taken at the regional and national levels.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change has often been discussed from the perspectives of social vulnerability and community vulnerability, recognising that characteristics at local level will influence the particular adaptations undertaken. However, the extent to which national-level systemic factors influence and shape measures defined as adaptations has seldom been recognised. Focusing on adaptation to climate change in forestry, this study uses the example of two countries in the northern hemisphere with different forest ownership structures, forestry industry and traditions: Sweden, with strong private, non-industrial ownership, dominant forest industry and long forestry traditions; and Scotland, with forest ownership dominated by large estates and investment forestry based on plantations of exotic conifer species. The study shows how adaptation to climate change is structurally embedded and conditioned, which has resulted in specific challenges and constraints for different groups of forest owners within these two different contexts. This produces a specific set of political spaces and policy tools by rendering climate change in relation to forestry manageable, negotiable and practical/logical in specific ways. It is recommended that the focus of future work on climate-related issues and development of adaptation measures and policy should not be primarily on climate-related factors, but on institutional analysis of structural factors and logics in target sectors, in order to critically explore concepts of agency and power within these processes.

AB  - In discussions on how to handle local heritage values, local values or insider-ness are often seen as synonymous with intangible aspects of heritage. At the same time, expert knowledge is usually associated with material objects, whereby experts have had the power to define what to preserve. In this study of three Norwegian towns, complementary and interdisciplinary methods have been used to address the relationship between personal and official perspectives on cultural heritage values and their tangible and intangible aspects. Results from interviews asking people to describe places they value in the area in which they live have been compared with results from a study of the official heritage plans in three selected towns. The study shows that a gap has unintentionally been constructed in the understanding of cultural heritage. To bridge the gap additional methods for documentation of cultural heritage and their contexts have to be developed. Experiments with various forms of active user participation are one way to introduce new additional approaches and thereby create local engagement and awareness of the role cultural heritage can play.

AB  - We investigate the urban transformation strategies of major developers and other key actors in the context of neoliberalism and its influence on politics, including urban development governance. Drawing primarily on interviews with corporate developers operating in the downtown areas of Oslo, Norway, we show how these influential actors with little formal political responsibility not only shape the physical structures but also significantly influence the social, economic and cultural fabric of the city. While they do not have a coordinated strategy, private developers do aim to transform urban areas to fit the preferences of the middle and upper classes. However, the situation is not as negative and predetermined as many critiques of gentrification processes assume. Besides demonstrating some positive outcomes of local transformation processes, our study shows that a fully gentrified downtown, along with the social exclusion mechanisms, has not been implemented yet.

AB  - Compared with most parts of Europe, northern Sweden is essentially a sparsely populated wilderness. There is, however, an ever increasing body of archaeological and palaeoecological information that shows that the region has a long cultural history. Tn this paper; results of pollen analytical investigations from four lakes with varved lake sediments, in the province of Angermanland, are presented. These investigations have yielded evidence of continuous and sedentary agriculture from the 6th century in the region close to the Bothnian coast and near the mouth of the large river Angermanalven. This early agriculture appears to have been based on animal husbandry and cereal, mainly barley, cultivation. During a second farming expansion phase at ca. A.D. 1200, rye cultivation became more important. The increased farming activity during this period was most pronounced at the coast and in the river valley, but more peripheral regions away from the river valley were also exploited. During the period A.D. 1600-1800, arable farming assumed greater importance. In the first decades of the 20th century, the area under cultivation declined, cereal cultivation mostly ceased and the fields were used for pasture.

AB  - This study examines how the EU Floods Directive - an extensive and innovative legislative instrument for integrated and participatory flood risk planning in all EU member states - influences local flood risk management in one member state, Sweden. The study identifies that: many municipalities have received new knowledge; cross-sectoral organisational structures for water and flood risk issues at the local level are being formed or strengthened; and the flood risk issue has been elevated up the political agenda. There are also however clear signs that a number of other fundamental issues are not being adequately addressed in the complex institutional setting that results from the directive's implementation. These issues are undoubtedly obstructing the development of a more integrated and participatory flood risk management system. Of key importance here are questions relating to how roles and mandates are communicated and adopted, the lack of coordination between the Floods Directive and the Water Framework Directive, and the inadequate involvement of the municipal level and other stakeholders. Practical recommendations on how to redirect development towards more positive outcomes in these areas are thus formulated.

AB  - The structure of ant communities was studied by sampling with pitfall traps in 24 mixed coniferous old-growth fragments (>140 yrs old), their edges, and managed surroundings of different ages in southern Finland. The old-forest ant community consisted of only three common shade-tolerant species, Formica aquilonia, Myrmica ruginodis and Camponotus herculeanus, whereas most of the ant species inhabited the early stages of forest succession. The size of the fragment affected only slightly the ant community. The most common territorial wood ant, F. aquilonia, structured the ant community by suppressing other species, although not equally so. The ant-community structure in the context of forest succession and landscape structure is discussed, and the successions in managed forests compared to those occurring after more natural disturbances. Forestry has changed the dynamics of succession and structural characteristics of the forest stands. Important changes of the landscape affecting forest-ant species are age-distribution of the forests and the fragmentation of old-growth forests accompanied by an increased proportion of edge habitats: open-country species have gained a greater inhabitable area and the relative abundances of the territorial wood-ant species (Formica s. str.) have changed. The multinest supercolonies of F. aquilonia have decreased, whereas species such as F. lugubris, which in our study area tend to be monodomous, have benefitted.

AB  - Small freshwater systems often depend on allochthonous organic subsidies to sustain productivity. Benthic invertebrates consuming coarse detritus maintain the energy flow by conveying dead organic matter into prey items and increase the food availability for other consumers. Compared to lotic systems, the dynamics of coarse detritus decomposition has not received much attention in lakes. The objectives of this study were to investigate the seasonality of leaf litter turnover and the timing of abundance of potential shredder species in a typical oligotrophic boreal lake. Leaf litter was experimentally exposed in litterbags in the littoral zone in Lake Valen from autumn to late spring two consecutive years. The weight loss rate of leaf litter initially followed the same pattern during both winter periods, but was markedly influenced by freezing in late winter the second year. Further, the seasonal variation patterns in abundance in litterbags were quite different among the potential shredder species. Only the limnephilid caddis larvae showed a density variation pattern possible to connect to the weight loss of leaf litter in litterbags. Otherwise frequent detritivores such as Asellus aquaticus and Leptophlebia marginata displayed lowest density in litterbags during the main weight loss period. However, after the long ice period the second winter the remaining leaf litter seemed to be consumed by A. aquaticus. With increasing knowledge of the initial leaf breakdown process and the guild of shredders in lakes, the decomposition rate may also in this habitat become a useful instrument when evaluating the impact from perturbations on ecosystem function.

We need to extend obtained data set to cover overall situation in forestry management, and estimate revenue and cost functions. These are predefined according to formulation of underlying optimal control problem and it is necessary to estimate coefficients of these functions. First, we describe and realize simulation procedure for obtaining data illustrating plantations of various mixed forests in the Morava region in the Czech Republic. Second, we estimate and discuss parameters of functions suitable for subsequent optimization.

AB  - The study describes an integrated impact assessment tool for the net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in forest production. The components of the net carbon exchange include the uptake of carbon into biomass, the decomposition of litter and humus, emissions from forest management operations and carbon released from the combustion of biomass and degradation of wood-based products. The tool enables the allocation of the total carbon emissions to the timber and energy biomass and to the energy produced on the basis of biomass. In example computations, ecosystem model simulations were utilized as an input to the tool. We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland. In our examples, the emissions allocated for the energy from biomass in southern Finland were 172 and 188 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in the current climate and in a CC, respectively, and 199 and 157 kg CO2 MW h(-1) in northern Finland. This study concludes that the tool is suitable for estimating the net carbon exchange of forest production. The tool also enables the allocation of direct and indirect carbon emissions, related to forest production over its life cycle, in different environmental conditions and for alternative time periods and land uses. Simulations of forest management regimes together with the CC give new insights into ecologically sustainable forest bioenergy and timber production, as well as climate change mitigation options in boreal forests.

AB  - An interesting alternative to wall-to-wall mapping approaches for the estimation of landscape metrics is to use sampling. Sample-based approaches are cost-efficient, and measurement errors can be reduced considerably. The previous efforts of sample-based estimation of landscape metrics have mainly been focused on data collection methods, but in this study, we consider two estimation procedures. First, landscape metrics of interest are calculated separately for each sampled image and then the image values are averaged to obtain an estimate of the entire landscape (separated procedure, SP). Second, metric components are calculated in all sampled images and then the aggregated values are inserted into the landscape metric formulas (aggregated procedure, AP). The national land cover map (NLCM) of Sweden, reflecting the status of land cover in the year 2000, was used to provide population information to investigate the statistical performance of the estimation procedures. For this purpose, sampling simulation with a large number of replications was used. For all three landscape metrics, the second procedure (AP) produced a lower relative RMSE and bias than the first one (SP). A smaller sample unit size (50 ha) produced larger bias than a larger one (100 ha), whereas a smaller sample unit size produced a lower variance than a larger sample unit. The efficiency of a metric estimator is highly related to the degree of landscape fragmentation and the selected procedure. Incorporating information from all of the sampled images into a single one (aggregated procedure, AP) is one way to improve the statistical performance of estimators.

AB  - Finland adopted the "green mining" concept to reconcile an increase in mineral extraction with conservation needs. Ongoing academic discussions call attention to the social and political factors supporting or challenging new mining projects in the Global North. Particularly understudied are the struggles over existence and knowledge that emerge during environmental accountability processes. This paper is an ethnographic investigation into the onto-epistemological conflict involving the Anglo American Sakatti mine project in the protected Viiankiaapa mire of the Finnish Arctic. It uses material from interviews and stakeholder meetings to analyze how the company's environmental impact assessment is being challenged and how people affected by mining are articulating their claims against the extractive ontology of replaceability. The findings, with parallels drawn to the Global South, suggest that green mine projects become ontologically conflicted and reveal their inherent fragility when companies increasingly try to minimize impacts and legitimate inevitable harm through offsetting.

AB  - The boreal biome exchanges large amounts of carbon (C) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) with the atmosphere and thus significantly affects the global climate. A managed boreal landscape consists of various sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) across forests, mires, lakes, and streams. Due to the spatial heterogeneity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net landscape carbon balance (NLCB). In this study, we compiled terrestrial and aquatic fluxes of CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, and harvested C obtained from tall-tower eddy covariance measurements, stream monitoring, and remote sensing of biomass stocks for an entire boreal catchment (68 km(2)) in Sweden to estimate the NLCB across the land-water-atmosphere continuum. Our results showed that this managed boreal forest landscape was a net C sink (NLCB = 39 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with the landscape-atmosphere CO2 exchange being the dominant component, followed by the C export via harvest and streams. Accounting for the global warming potential of CH4, the landscape was a GHG sink of 237 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1), thus providing a climate-cooling effect. The CH4 flux contribution to the annual GHG budget increased from 0.6% during spring to 3.2% during winter. The aquatic C loss was most significant during spring contributing 8% to the annual NLCB. We further found that abiotic controls (e.g., air temperature and incoming radiation) regulated the temporal variability of the NLCB whereas land cover types (e.g., mire vs. forest) and management practices (e.g., clear-cutting) determined their spatial variability. Our study advocates the need for integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes at the landscape scale based on tall-tower eddy covariance measurements combined with biomass stock and stream monitoring to develop a holistic understanding of the NLCB of managed boreal forest landscapes and to better evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change.

AB  - A comparison of social impact categorisation in strategic planning across European Union Member States shows that Sweden neither categorises nor breaks down categories of social impact in areas such as transport infrastructure development. This is surprising because Sweden is known as a country concerned about social issues and having a high standard of welfare. This article accordingly studies how social issues are handled during transport infrastructure planning. An analysis of different source materials will answer four research questions: 1) To what extent are social impacts integrated into environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports? 2) Are social impacts sufficiently integrated and/or does this treatment simply amount to 'good practice'? 3) Can any trend be detected over time in terms of addressing social issues in impact assessments? 4) What key measures could increase the influence of social impact issues on transport infrastructure planning practice? The study involved a content analysis of six EIA handbooks and EIA statements (EISs) for 18 large transport infrastructure projects. The concepts searched for in these documents largely apply to issues of vulnerability, health, social problems, perceived safety, and alienation. Our data were interpreted through the theoretical lens of institutional interplay. We found that though social aspects are not new considerations in EIA research, they are included in only a small proportion of the 18 Swedish EISs, mostly in connection with health and accessibility. We believe that this does not suffice. We also found that the more recent documents allotted less space to social issues. It is unlikely that most individuals in the organisations that order EISs, or the consultancies that write them, are unaware of the broader interpretation of 'human beings' which includes social aspects. Based on increasing interest in social issues in planning and due to the lack of national goals and guidelines in this area, some municipalities and consultants have begun to create their own methods of measuring and assessing social impacts. This has resulted in multiple local-level practitioners who want to develop social issues within impact assessment, and possibly also to introduce a social impact assessment framework, but with no management or coordination among them. The conclusion is that in the absence of a government initiative to clarify how social impacts can be addressed in transport infrastructure planning, there is a need for an external network for organisations involved in transport infrastructure EISs.

AB  - Cities are hubs of social interaction, trade, and innovation. Yet, they face sustainability challenges of economic decline, social injustices, and environmental degradation. Urban planning is a critical instrument to cope with these challenges. Visioning, the process of constructing desirable future states, can provide direction for sustainability-oriented planning and decision-making and is increasingly used in this capacity. However, there is ample evidence that urban visions are often not designed along a robust set of sustainability principles. We analyze nine explicitly sustainability-related urban visions from Sweden, Germany, Ireland, Canada, USA, and Australia with respect to their sustainability substance, i.e. in how far they, broadly and in detail, adhere to sustainability principles. Using rough set analysis, we identify a number of procedural components that enable or obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance in urban visions. Results indicate that the sampled urban visions do not substantially and comprehensively include sustainability substance, instead narrowly focus on optimizing the built environment, for example. Furthermore, the sustainability substance of visioning processes benefits from stakeholder engagement that includes capacity building, whereas some other types of participation obstruct the inclusion of sustainability substance. The study concludes with recommendations for visioning processes to yield urban visions with sustainability substance inclusive of a diverse and integrated set of sustainability principles.

AB  - Recent wildlife population declines are usually attributed to multiple sources such as global climate change and habitat loss and degradation inducing decreased food supply. However, interactive effects of fluctuations in abundance of main foods and weather conditions on population densities and reproductive success have been studied rarely. We analysed long-term (1973-2018) data on Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) and the influence of prey abundance and weather on breeding densities and reproductive success in western Finland. We found that fledgling production per breeding attempt declined and laying date of the owl population delayed during the period between 1973 and 2018. The breeding density of the owl population decreased with increasing temperature in winter (October-March), fledgling production increased with increasing temperature and precipitation in spring (April-June), whereas the initiation of egg-laying was delayed with increasing depth of snow cover in late winter (January-March). The decreasing trend of fledgling production, which was mainly due to starvation of offspring, was an important factor contributing to the long-term decline of the Tengmalm's owl study population. Milder and more humid spring and early summer temperatures due to global warming were not able to compensate for lowered offspring production of owls. The main reason for low productivity is probably loss and degradation of mature and old-growth forests due to clear-felling which results in loss of coverage of prime habitat for main (bank voles) and alternative foods (small birds) of owls inducing lack of food, and refuges against predators of Tengmalm's owls. This interpretation was also supported by the delayed start of egg-laying during the study period although ambient temperatures increased prior to and during the egg-laying period.

AB  - This paper presents the results of pollen, diatom, charcoal, and sediment analyses from Lake Bol'shoye Zavetnoye, situated between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga on the Karelian Isthmus, north-western Russia. The main goal is to contribute to the discussion of Neolithic land use in north-eastern Europe. The article aims to answer questions related to Stone Age hunter-gatherer economy, ecology, and anthropogenic environmental impact through a comprehensive combination of multiple types of palaeoecological data and archaeological material. According to diatom data, Lake Bol'shoye Zavetnoye was influenced by the water level oscillations of Ancient Lake Ladoga during much of the Holocene. Intensified human activity and prolonged human occupation become visible in the Lake Bol'shoye Zavetnoye pollen data between 4480 BC and 3250 BC. During the final centuries of the Stone Age, a new phase of land use began, as several anthropogenic indicators, such asTriticum, Cannabis, andPlantago lanceolataappear in the pollen data and a decrease inPinusvalues is recorded. In general, the results indicate that socio-cultural transformations could have taken place already from the mid-5th millennium BC onwards, including new ways of utilizing the environment, perhaps also in the field of subsistence, even though the livelihood was based on foraging throughout the period.

AB  - Discards represent a loss of natural resources and negatively affect the sustainability of fisheries. Information on discards, such as diversity and size of the species discarded is essential to better manage trawl fisheries. Thus, this study aims to gain knowledge on discards from the Catalan bottom trawl fisheries in the NW Mediterranean Sea to offer information needed for fisheries management. Discard ratios, species composition of discards and lengths of the discards were analyzed from data collected on board commercial trawlers, from November 2018 to December 2020 and analyzed by depth, zone, and season. Discard ratio varied among depths from 30.5% in the shallowest depth (20 - 70 m) to 14.3% in the deepest (400-700 m), with depth being the main factor deter-mining the species composition of discards. This study also focused on the discards of six main commercial species, i.e. European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), black-bellied angler (Lophius budegassa), poor cod (Trisopterus capelanus), deep-water pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). The length at which 50% of individuals were discarded (L50d) was lower than the Length at First Maturity (LFM) and the Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) for the six species. These findings provide relevant information to comply with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive's (EU Directive 2008/56/EC) ecosystem approach to fisheries and to evaluate the implementation of measures for fisheries' best management practices, such as gear selectivity and spatial planning.

AB  - We investigated the stand structure of ten young urban woodlands established in Southern Scandinavia during the 1970s and 1980s according to the ecological approach, which advocated the use of many different species of trees and shrubs to create complex canopy structures as soon as possible after establishment to promote recreation and biodiversity. Tree height and live crown depths were measured and analysed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the forest structure in terms of canopy stratification. The results show that the current canopy structures could be classified into seven different two- and three-layered structural types which had evolved as a combination of differences in management frequency and the initial species composition. Two layered stands were characterized by lower management frequency compared to three layered stands and stands in transition to three layers. They were also established with a lower proportion of understory species and a higher proportion of shade tree species. The total number of species at the establishment did not influence how stands were categorized. The two main conclusions are that recurrent thinnings is a key factor for successful management of young, species rich forest plantations, and that species composition can increase the resilience towards management neglect. Instead of aiming at maximising total species number it is more reasonable to focus on a few key species in each layer. We conclude that three-layered canopy structures can be created already after twenty five years, which should encourage planners and practitioners to incorporate multilayered stands in future urban woodland creation.

AB  - Thin, hair-like lichens (Alectoria, Bryoria, Usnea) form conspicuous epiphyte communities across the boreal biome. These poikilohydric organisms provide important ecosystem functions and are useful indicators of global change. We analyse how environmental drivers influence changes in occurrence and length of these lichens on Norway spruce (Picea abies) over 10 years in managed forests in Sweden using data from >6000 trees. Alectoria and Usnea showed strong declines in southern-central regions, whereas Bryoria declined in northern regions. Overall, relative loss rates across the country ranged from 1.7% per year in Alectoria to 0.5% in Bryoria. These losses contrasted with increased length of Bryoria and Usnea in some regions. Occurrence trajectories (extinction, colonization, presence, absence) on remeasured trees correlated best with temperature, rain, nitrogen deposition, and stand age in multinomial logistic regression models. Our analysis strongly suggests that industrial forestry, in combination with nitrogen, is the main driver of lichen declines. Logging of forests with long continuity of tree cover, short rotation cycles, substrate limitation and low light in dense forests are harmful for lichens. Nitrogen deposition has decreased but is apparently still sufficiently high to prevent recovery. Warming correlated with occurrence trajectories of Alectoria and Bryoria, likely by altering hydration regimes and increasing respiration during autumn/winter. The large-scale lichen decline on an important host has cascading effects on biodiversity and function of boreal forest canopies. Forest management must apply a broad spectrum of methods, including uneven-aged continuous cover forestry and retention of large patches, to secure the ecosystem functions of these important canopy components under future climates. Our findings highlight interactions among drivers of lichen decline (forestry, nitrogen, climate), functional traits (dispersal, lichen colour, sensitivity to nitrogen, water storage), and population processes (extinction/colonization).

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the landscape's cultural values in the practical work of biosphere reserves and to identify what opportunities there are to increase awareness and knowledge about these values. The paper draws upon data collected in a Swedish biosphere reserve, including a survey of residents, interviews with public officials involved in cultural heritage management, and an analysis of documents produced by the Biosphere Reserve Association. Residents showed a broad knowledge about the landscape's cultural values, and they linked immaterial heritage to material objects. The residents' strong identity and pride in relation to the landscape were confirmed by the officials, who argued that it is the deep layers of history and the cultural diversity of the landscape that make the biosphere reserve attractive. However, concepts related to the landscape's cultural values were barely touched upon in the documents analysed; the landscape's cultural values were presented as a background-as an abstract value. The findings reveal several unexplored opportunities and practical implications to increase awareness and knowledge of the landscape's cultural values. Suggested actions include definition of goals, articulation and use of concepts, inventories of actors, increased collaboration, and use of residents' knowledge. Cultural values of landscapes are often neglected in the practical work of biosphere reserves, despite the social and cultural dimensions of sustainable development being an important component of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme. This research indicates several ways of bridging this gap between theory and practice.

AB  - There now exists a negative attitude towards using fire clearing and especially unbroken fire control in forestry and forest use in Russia. However, we know that the considerable conifer areas that were cut in recent years are being overgrown by deciduous species in the northern part of European Russia and most of them are now unforested. spaces with heaps of discarded slash. Forest loggers are reluctant to clear felled areas after logging and very often they prefer to cut new forests to provide more cubic metres. On the other hand, the successful experience of fire clearing of felled areas in Finland, USA, Canada, Sweden, Norway and Australia has shown the necessity to study and to put into practice these positive results in forestry and forest use in Russia. Certain scientific developments in Russia and successful experience of some technological methods of the previous decades and also some contemporary researches in this field make this problem urgent at present. By comparative analysis of fired and unfired clearing of felled areas and lands damaged by wild fire, differences in rates of forest regeneration are demonstrated, with special reference to the Komi Republic. On the basis of obtained quantitative characteristics of regeneration of felled areas and fire-damaged lands, some specific practical recommendations on using different methods of fire clearing of felled areas and using repeated fire in different forest conditions of northern European Russia are given. These recommendations enable us to substantially improve the level of forest management of presently unforested lands.

AB  - Methods used to monitor variation in population sizes in both Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout (sea trout) have been widely used in Norway the last 20 years. However, a national management regime, based on population data, has only been established for one of the two species, the Atlantic salmon. One prerequisite for using this "one species" model is that there is negligible interspecific competition between salmon and trout in the rivers. This may, however, be an oversimplification of the real situation. The pre-fishery abundance (PFA), monitored with combination of underwater video systems, snorkelling counts, and catch statistics will, in most rivers, include both salmon and Sea Trout. In the present study, we estimated a total PFA for rivers, or groups of rivers, in eight regions in Norway in 2019. The total size of each river system was measured by abiotic factors such as river area, river length, annual mean water flow, and size of precipitation field; additionally, one biotic factor, smolt age, was used to standardise PFA data across regions. A comparison shows that the standardised total PFA of salmon and trout varies across regions where the highest estimated PFA was four times higher than the lowest. Compared to the traditional one-species approach, the merged PFA data show a different population status in the eight regions. The difference in the two approaches was mainly linked to the variation in size in anadromous brown trout populations. Merging data from salmon and trout populations in defined regions may be a better input in a management model than the current model used by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Salmon Management (VRL).

AB  - The objective of fc,rest management planning is often expressed as maximum sustainable economic yield. Methods used to collect information for forestry planning should, therefore, include variables significant for economic evaluations of management alternatives. It is important to be able to differentiate mature stands with respect to timber volumes and species mixture. In this study, digital high-altitude aerial photographs are tested as a data source for planning. Circular plot data from a forest estate in northern Sweden were used as reference material. Global positioning system (GPS) measurements, with differential correction, were used to georeference the plots. Harvesting priorities were calculated for each plot using the Forest Management Planning Package. Volumes, species mixture and harvest priorities were estimated using regression analysis based on textural and spectral information from aerial photographs. The results show that the dependent variables could be estimated fairly well using only spectral information, e.g., R-2 = 0.44 when estimating timber volume at reference plot (10 m radius) level. Aggregated to stand level, the precision was comparable with customary field survey methods (e.g., RMSE = 13.4% for timber volume).

AB  - Management of forest for wood production has altered ecosystem structures and processes and led to habitat loss and species extinctions, worldwide. Deadwood is a key resource supporting forest biodiversity, and commonly declines following forest management. However, different forest management methods affect dead wood differently. For example, uneven aged silviculture maintains an age-stratified forest with ongoing dead wood production, while even-aged silviculture breaks forest continuity, leading to long periods without large trees. We asked how deadwood-dependent beetles respond to different silvicultural practices and if their responses depend on deadwood volume, and beetles preference for decay stages of deadwood. We compared beetle assemblages in five boreal forest types with different management strategies: clearcutting and thinning (both representing even-aged silviculture), selective felling (representing uneven-aged silviculture), reference and old growth forest (both uneven-aged controls without a recent history [similar to 50 years] of management, but the latter with high conservation values). We collected beetles using window traps and by sieving the bark from experimental logs (bolts). Beetle assemblages on clear-cuts differed from all other stand types, regardless of trapping method or decay stage preference. Thinning differed from reference stands, indicating incomplete recovery after clear-cutting, while selective felling differed only from clear-cuts. In contrast to our predictions, early and late successional species responded similarly to different silvicultural practices. However, there were indications of marginal assemblage differences both between thinned stands and selective felling and between thinned and old growth stands (p = 0.10). The stand volume of early decay stage wood influenced assemblage composition of early, but not late successional species. Uneven-aged silviculture maintained species assemblages similar to those of the reference and old growth stands and might therefore be a better management option when considering biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The paper discusses the difficult and complex roles of the regulator in limiting the occurrence of organisational accidents by using The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) as a case. NPD was established in 1972 and assigned with a double role as regulator; Giving advice towards creating a highest possible value for society from oil and gas production and as risk-controller by ensuring a sound management of resources, safety and environment. In that capacity they became a forerunner in developing principles of self-regulation as a new regulatory regime. After 30 years of operation NPD was splitted and a new Petroleum Safety Authority established. What are the achievements and what are the drawbacks in the divided model compared to the integrated model?.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the differences in growth parameters (height, diameter, site index) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in three regions located in different parts of the European pine limit (Wroclaw, SW Poland; Kolari and Kevo, N Finland) with reference to soil texture. The detailed research conducted in the Wroclaw region (349 plots) was confronted with preliminary results from Finland (18 plots). Despite the fact that the study was based on a relatively low number of plots for the Finnish regions, statistically different mean site index values between all the studied regions were found. The study determined also the magnitude of differences in height and diameter of pines being at the same age, but growing in various climatic regions of European pine limit. The effect of soil texture on site index of pine stands was found only for the Wroclaw region; however, it concerned ecosystems with sandy soils. For detail investigation of potential existence of the effect for pine ecosystems of northern Finland this preliminary study should be expanded to more research plots located in this zone. The results of this research suggest that in Central Europe Scots pine does not fully utilize the fertility of soils when grown on fine-textured pedons. Thus, such soils should be primarily designed for conversion of pine monocultures into broadleaved stands.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a consensus-driven process identifying 50 priority research questions for historical ecology obtained through crowdsourcing, literature reviews, and in-person workshopping. A deliberative approach was designed to maximize discussion and debate with defined outcomes. Two in-person workshops (in Sweden and Canada) over the course of two years and online discussions were peer facilitated to define specific key questions for historical ecology from anthropological and archaeological perspectives. The aim of this research is to showcase the variety of questions that reflect the broad scope for historical-ecological research trajectories across scientific disciplines. Historical ecology encompasses research concerned with decadal, centennial, and millennial human-environmental interactions, and the consequences that those relationships have in the formation of contemporary landscapes. Six interrelated themes arose from our consensus-building workshop model: (1) climate and environmental change and variability; (2) multi-scalar, multi-disciplinary; (3) biodiversity and community ecology; (4) resource and environmental management and governance; (5) methods and applications; and (6) communication and policy. The 50 questions represented by these themes highlight meaningful trends in historical ecology that distill the field down to three explicit findings. First, historical ecology is fundamentally an applied research program. Second, this program seeks to understand long-term human-environment interactions with a focus on avoiding, mitigating, and reversing adverse ecological effects. Third, historical ecology is part of convergent trends toward transdisciplinary research science, which erodes scientific boundaries between the cultural and natural.

AB  - Background A sustainable energy system based on renewables, energy-efficiency, decentralisation of energy generation and synergies between different sectors requires new energy planning methods and policies. Energy transition and climate change mitigation achievement can no longer be seen only through top-down activities from a national government. Local and regional governments have a crucial role in delivering public policies relevant to such endeavour. Therefore, the implementation of multilevel governance (MLG) has become a priority for fostering local and regional development more inclusively. Paper analyses the existing energy planning governance in Austria throughout the MLG structure by focusing on the alignment between the local energy and climate initiatives and the national and EU goals. Also, the paper examined the effectiveness of the current MLG structures and outlined the fields where improvements are needed. The successfulness of the MLG approach is shown on Judenburg city case study. Desk research is enhanced by a series of interviews with energy policy experts and implementation of case study measures in TIMES model. Results The MLG analysis showed the solid alignment of different governance levels. In contrast, the comparison of the energy and climate initiatives on the local level outlined recommendations for the design of more effective energy planning approach. Four areas of action are identified for further improvement: territorial fragmentation, data availability, spatial energy planning and new integrated MLG. The remaining non-conventional biomass potential of the Murtal region is enough to increase the share of district heating for the residential buildings of the Judenburg city from 16.3 to 30.8% while the building refurbishment increases district heating share to 32%. Conclusion Application of MLG analysis demonstrated the alignment of energy targets in Austrian policy on different governance levels. The general willingness of Austrian municipalities to take part in local energy actions was shown through the local initiatives' analysis. It is argued that strengthening the listed areas of work is necessary to raise the effectiveness of the local initiatives. The case study for the city of Judenburg developed in the TIMES model confirmed that coordinated actions from different levels of governance lead to effective implementation of measures.

AB  - The creation of an efficient public transport system increasingly requires collaboration between independent organizations. Institutional reforms in Europe have created governance situations where collaboration between organizations is a critical issue, and examples include the integration of transport and land-use planning and the planning of large public transport projects. The organizational context of public transport, with several formal, discrete organizations that need to collaborate, raises questions about how functioning collaborations can be accomplished. This paper examines how to create functioning collaboration between organizations in the public transport sector. We depart from a theory of collaboration as a stepwise trust-building process, and we present results from a comparative case study of collaboration in two Swedish public transport projects. The results show some of the prerequisites that must be in place in order for the collaboration to work, but also the boundaries of what collaborative approaches can bring about. Conditions such as honest, open, and inclusive dialog between stakeholders and resources in the form of finance, knowledge, mandate, and leadership are important. While there is no guarantee that this will lead to differences in interests being resolved, the results indicate that it improves the chances of finding compromises that all of the involved stakeholders can accept, especially if favorable conditions for collaboration are established at an early stage of the planning process. Building on these findings, we suggest some practical recommendations for improving collaboration in future public transport projects. These practical recommendations are aimed at improving the handling of unavoidable conflicts in collaboration in a constructive way.

AB  - Along the northwest coast of Sweden, over 50% of Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) meadows have vanished since the 1980s. With the improvement of conditions, there is a growing interest to restore lost habitats, but methods are lacking for restoration of eelgrass beds at high latitudes where long winters create special challenges. We assessed if seed planting could be used for large-scale restoration, with the aim to identify the major causes of seed and seedling loss and to determine which planting method best increases restoration success. In the laboratory, we identified optimal conditions for long-term seed storage and demonstrated that eelgrass seeds can be successfully stored for 8 mo before being planted in the spring. However, field studies did not find an increased seedling establishment in seeds planted in the spring of 2013 compared to those planted in the fall of 2012. Field results suggest that the main causes for the seed loss were seed predation from crabs, seed transport by currents and bioturbation by lugworms, while the main processes affecting shoot development were light availability and physical disturbance. Covering the seeds with a layer of sand increased seedling establishment 2 to 6 times compared to uncovered seeds, probably through the reduction of seed predation and seed transport, and could potentially be developed as a method to reduce losses during restoration. In addition, positive feedback mechanisms (i.e. sediment resuspension and drifting macroalgae mats) may also prevent natural recovery and restoration success. However, high seed loss (on average 98.6%) and high shoot mortality pose a challenge that need to be addressed before restoration using seeds can be recommended for large-scale restoration.

AB  - Although the concept of the blue economy was created by the Small Island Developing States, its relevance extends to any coastal region around the globe, making the engagement of both state and corporate actors imperative. At the core of the blue economy framework stands the incorporation of ocean values and services into economic modeling and governance. Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture are thus significant in this endeavor, particularly for Arctic nations, the economies of which are predominantly based on seafood production. Yet, while focus is increasingly placed on sustainability and blue economy models among Arctic states, the need for structured transnational collaboration is not always acknowledged. In that respect, this article aims to articulate a comparative study of the status quo, challenges, and opportunities of fisheries and aquaculture in Alaska and northern Norway and seeks to explore potentials for cross-sectoral synergies between the two regions in the context of the blue economy.

AB  - An important goal for ecosystem-based management is to protect marine habitats and their associated fauna. Understanding the spatial structure and interrelationships of benthic communities and their underlying environmental drivers, therefore, is of great importance. The benthic community off the sub-Arctic Lofoten-Vesteralen islands was studied on multiple spatial scales, using the MEM (Moran's eigenvector maps) framework to identify spatial structure in broadscale (hundreds of kilometers), mesoscale (20 km), and fine-scale (1.5 km) epifaunal and infaunal communities. A combination of eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and variation partitioning on multiple sets of explanatory variables was used to identify characteristic species and environmental drivers that have a high importance in structuring the communities. Community structure of both epifauna and infauna strongly reflected the boundary of warm Atlantic (>0.5 degrees C) and cold Arctic water masses (<0.5 degrees C), which coincides approximately with the 800-m isobath in this region. Apart from this dominant broadscale determinant, epifauna and infauna displayed different spatial patterns and drivers. Both components differ significantly across local marine landscapes; however, this characterization is not sufficient for infauna, where additional sediment characteristics play an important role in structuring the community across all spatial scales. Within marine landscapes (mesoscale), epifauna displays a spatial structure that, for the most part, could not be attributed to any of the included environmental drivers. The case of the Lofoten-Vesteralen region demonstrated that the used analysis is a valuable tool in spatial planning, as it allows for comparison of the relative importance of individual environmental drivers for the studied faunal components, without losing the information about spatial patterns associated with individual drivers.

AB  - Changes of the ground-layer vegetation between 1983 and 1993 were studied on permanent oak forest plots in Skane and eastern Smaland, two regions of South Sweden rich in oak but with different climatic conditions. 79 of the 123 more common species differed considerably in frequency between Skane and Smaland. The oak forests in Skane contained more typical forest species, whereas the number of light-demanding grassland species was higher in Smaland. Almost half of the more common species showed significant changes in frequency between 1983 and 1993. Several species of clearings and some light-demanding grassland species increased their frequency in Skane. They were probably favoured by canopy thinning which occurred in 65 out of 95 permanent plots. Only two species decreased in frequency in Skane, but 14 species showed a decrease in Smaland. All were typical grassland species and their decline may be regarded as a long-term response to ceased grazing and tree canopy closure as almost no tree cutting occurred during the study period in Smaland. Total species richness increased with management intensity in Skane. This was due to decreasing species losses and increasing establishment of new species at intense management. A small general increase in species numbers was recorded in Smaland. Species richness was more closely related to soil pH in Skane than in Smaland. The floristic variability between the oak forest plots was closely related to soil pH in both Skane and Smaland. We suggest that changes of light conditions as a result of changes in forest management are important for current secondary succession in South Swedish oak forests, whereas the general floristic pattern is to a large extent controlled by soil acidity.

AB  - The Norwegian government operates pelagic fishery management systems designed to avoid overfishing and foster sustainable annual landings while at the same time managing an export promotion program designed to increase foreign sales of herring and mackerel. Simultaneously promoting foreign sales of pelagic fish and limiting the availability of those fish for sale are policies in apparent conflict. This research demonstrates, however, that effective limits on the availability of pelagic fish for export tend to complement the profit-enhancing export promotion objectives of the Norwegian Seafood Council (NSC) for the Norwegian herring and mackerel industries. Assuming highly (but not perfectly) effective limits on herring and mackerel exports arising from their respective fishery management systems over the 2003 to 2018 period of analysis, NSC herring and mackerel export promotion contributed 5-7% to Norwegian herring export revenue and industry profit, respectively and 11-15% to Norwegian mackerel export revenue and industry profit, respectively. Less effective limitation on Norwegian herring and mackerel export supplies would erode the respective industry revenue and profit gains from NSC export promotion. In essence, the NSC effectively exploits the limits on herring and mackerel export availability imposed by Norwegian fishery management systems for the benefit of Norwegian herring and mackerel industries.

AB  - Physiological and psychological constraints, e.g. increased risk of serious illness or loneliness imposed by mobility restrictions, make older adults one of the hardest hit tourist segments amidst during and after COVID-19. Older adults play a particularly important role as consumers of cultural tourism services. To mitigate for lack of in-situ cultural tourism experiences, many service providers have moved their offerings to a digital format, from virtual museum tours to livestreamed concerts. However, previous research suggests that older adults may not be as agile users of digital technology as younger tourists, potentially making it difficult for them to partake in digital cultural tourism. To that end, this paper explores factors influencing older adults' acceptance and use of digital technology to access and partake in digital cultural tourism experiences. An empirical study drawing on technology acceptance model (TAM) is conducted, whereby 357 Finnish older adults (aged 60+) are surveyed. Findings indicate that digital cultural tourism services are seen to complement in-situ cultural tourism experiences to some degree, but that challenges such as lack of feeling of community and interaction, technical constraints, as well as lack of information of available services limit adoption. Implications for tourism management are considered.

AB  - Countries' growth along with the need to protect the environment has made waste management a major global concern. In this study, a detailed analysis is carried out of the current situation in 41 countries belonging to the OECD and/or the European Union, in order to identify the most sustainable practices that could be successfully implemented in other nations with similar characteristics. Cluster analysis is used to detect homogeneous groups, shedding light on the possible connection between environmental policies and waste treatment. Contingency tables are employed to determine the relationship between the effectiveness of the policies adopted and two indicators of sustainable practices: material recycling and waste generation. The study is conducted using statistical information from the Sustainable Governance Indicators project and the OECD, with data referring to 2018. Five internally homogeneous groups of countries have been identified, where Israel, Turkey and USA have the lowest participation and compliance in environmental policies. Also, the results show that countries with a high degree of participation in environmental treaties (Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) are making great progress, reducing the use of landfills in favour of other, more environmentally friendly options. Moreover, the contingency tables confirm that the effectiveness of policies translates into a clear trend towards recycling and, to some extent, reduces waste generation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intensive management of boreal forests impairs forest biodiversity and species of old-growth forest. Effective measures to support biodiversity require detection of locations valuable for conservation. We applied species distribution models (SDMs) to a species of mature forest, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis, goshawk), that is often associated with hotspots of forest biodiversity. We located optimal sites for the goshawk on a landscape scale, assessed their state under intensified logging operations and identified characteristics of goshawks' nesting sites in boreal forests. Optimal sites for the goshawk covered only 3.4% of the boreal landscape and were mostly located outside protected areas, which highlights the importance of conservation actions in privately-owned forests. Furthermore, optimal sites for the goshawk and associated biodiversity were under threat. Half of them were logged to some extent and 10% were already lost or notably deteriorated due to logging shortly after 2015 for which our models were calibrated. Habitat suitability for the goshawk increased with increasing volume of Norway spruce (Picea abies) peaking at 220 m(3) ha(-1), and with small quantities of birches (Betula spp.) and other broad-leaved trees. Threats to biodiversity of mature spruce forests are likely to accelerate in the future with increasing logging pressures and shorter rotation periods. Logging should be directed less to forests with high biodiversity. Continuous supply of mature spruce forests in the landscape should be secured with a denser network of protected areas and measures that aid in sparing large entities of mature forest on privately-owned land.

AB  - The current regulations governing production of biofuels in the European Union require that they have to mitigate climate change, by producing > 35% less greenhouse gases (GHG) than fossil fuels. There is a risk that this may not be achievable, since land use for crop production inevitably emits the potent GHG nitrous oxide (N2O), due to nitrogen fertilisation and cycling in the environment. We analyse first-generation biofuel production on agricultural land and conclude that efficient agricultural crop production resulting in a good harvest and low N2O emission can fulfil the EU standard, and is possible under certain conditions for the Swedish agricultural and bioethanol production systems. However, in years having low crop yields, and where cropping is on organic soils, total GHG emissions per unit of fuel produced can be even higher than those released by burning of fossil fuels. In general, the N2O emission size in Sweden and elsewhere in northern Europe is such that there is a > 50% chance that the 35% saving requirement will not be met. Thus ecosystem N2O emissions have to be convincingly assessed. Here we compare Swedish emission data with values estimated by means of statistical models and by a global, top-down, approach; the measurements and the predictions often show higher values that would fail to meet the EU standard and thus prevent biofuel production development.

AB  - We compare two reindeer pasture regions in Norway. Both were exposed to the same external changes, such a new technologies, increased market access, and new state policies. As North became overgrazed in the 1980s. South was not. In explaining this, we focus on interaction between such external factors and internal characteristics like the natural resource base and the Sami institutions. South herder leaders pursued institutional transformations included in state policies, however, the state policy was not legitimate in the North. We recommend focus on self-governance, cultural dynamics, and examining many relevant factors before the imposition of changes in governance structures and incentive systems.

AB  - Roads have a pervasive multi-faceted influence on ecosystems, including pronounced impacts on wildlife movements. In recognition of the scale-transcending impacts of transportation infrastructure, ecologists have been encouraged to extend the study of barrier impacts from individual roads and animals to networks and populations. In this study, we adopt an analytical representation of road networks as mosaics of landscape tiles, separated by roads. We then adapt spatial capture-recapture analysis to estimate the propensity of wildlife to stay within the boundaries of the road network tiles (RNTs) that hold their activity centres. We fit the model to national non-invasive genetic monitoring data for brown bears Ursus arctos in Sweden and show that bears had up to 73% lower odds of using areas outside the network tile of their home range centre, even after accounting for the effect of natural barriers (major rivers) and the decrease in utilization with increasing distance from a bear's activity centre. Our study highlights the pronounced landscape-level barrier effect on wildlife mobility and, in doing so, introduces a novel and flexible approach for quantifying contemporary fragmentation from the scale of RNTs and individual animals to transportation networks and populations.

AB  - Land-use legacy on forest dynamics at both stand and landscape scale can last for centuries, affecting forest structure and species composition. We aimed to disentangle the history of the charcoal production legacies that historically shaped Mont Avic Natural Park (Aosta Valley, Italy) forests by integrating LiDAR, GIS, anthracological, and field data at the landscape scale. We adopted different geostatistical tools to relate geographic layers from various data sources. The overexploitation due to intensive charcoal production to fuel mining activities shaped the current forests by homogenising their structure and species composition into dense and young stands with a reduction in late seral species such as Norway spruce (Picea abies) and an increase in pioneer species such as Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata). The multidisciplinary and multi-scale framework adopted in this study stresses the role of historical landscape ecology in evaluating ecosystem resilience to past anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Recent loss of plant species richness in Swedish semi-natural grasslands has led to an increase in grassland recreation and restoration. To increase the establishment of declining species favoured by grazing and to re-establish original species richness, seed sowing has been discussed as a conservation tool. In this study, I examined to what extent seed sowing in former arable fields increases species richness and generates a species composition typical of semi-natural grasslands. Six grassland species favoured by grazing (target species) and six generalist species favoured by ceased grazing, were studied in a seed-addition experiment. Four different seed densities were used on four different grassland categories, two grazed former arable fields, one continuously grazed grassland and one abandoned grassland. Target and generalist species emerged in all grassland categories, but seedling emergence was higher in the grazed than in the abandoned grassland. Target species had higher emergence in the two grasslands with the longest grazing continuity. Seedling emergence and frequency of established plants of each target species were positively associated. The largest fraction of seeds germinated at an intermediate sowing density, 20-50 seeds/dm(2), suggesting that aggregation of seeds positively affects emergence up to a certain threshold. In conclusion, artificial seed sowing may induce the recreation of typical grassland communities on former arable fields, which may be an important contribution to increase the total grassland area and species richness in the landscape.

AB  - The two brown frogs Rana arvalis and Rana temporaria were monitored at 57 localities (that contained a total of 120 ponds) for up to 17 years each during the years 1989-2005. The analysis summarized below only accounts for trends within sites actually usable for frogs during the analysis period, large scale habitat losses are thus not accounted for. R. arvalis populations tended to increase over the study period. R. temporaria populations displayed no significant change. However, both species displayed significant fluctuations from year to year. These were not correlated between the two species. Localities with permanent ponds tended to display more positive population trends than localities with temporary ponds and ponds in pastures tended to display more positive trends than those in forests. For ponds in cropped fields, where only R. temporaria were found, the trend were also generally negative. Thus, long-term trends suggest that neither species is in decline. Nevertheless, the population trends observed in more exploited habitats are less positive than those in relatively unexploited habitats. We conclude frog populations in agricultural habitats should be more carefully studied to identify the factors behind the decline. The negative trend in temporary ponds are cause for a closer analysis of the effects of weather factors on frog population dynamics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For huntable waterbird species, the autumn migration strategy may be important for their fitness, as their behaviour and environmental factors may influence their exposure to hunting mortality. Hunting activity may also reduce the access to food resources which may be limited in the wintering areas, thereby affecting winter survival. In this study we assessed the possible influence of food resources, weather conditions, inter-specific competition and hunting intensity (as a measure of possible disturbance) on abundance and distribution of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus at their main autumn stopover site in Norway. The results show that food resources in term of spilt cereal grain were abundant, even by the time the geese had moved on. Snow cover did not limit the food availability during the main migratory period. Inter-specific competition with greylag geese Anser anser reduced food supplies locally and appeared to be increasing. Goose hunting intensity varied among sites and our data indicate a negative relationship between hunting intensity and the rate at which geese consumed the food resources. Collectively, our results suggest that the majority of pink-footed geese leave the stopover area earlier than they would otherwise, when hunting intensities are high. In the case of pink-footed geese, population consequences of disturbance is not a concern at present; however, an international species management plan calls for 1) keeping disturbance low in areas where geese do not cause conflicts with agriculture to prevent them being pushed to areas with problems, and 2) increased harvest to reduce and stabilise the population size. Both objectives can be met by reducing hunting disturbance in mid-Norway and it is recommended that a better local organisation of hunting is implemented.

AB  - Signal crayfish, as an invasive alien species in Europe, have caused impacts on aquatic communities and losses of native crayfish. Eradication of recently established populations may be possible in small ponds (<2.5 ha) and short lengths of small watercourses using a nonselective biocide. Between 2004 and 2012, a total of 13 sites in the U.K. were assessed for suitability. Six were treated with natural pyrethrum and crayfish were successfully eradicated from three. In Norway, five sites were assessed and two sites were treated with a synthetic pyrethroid, cypermethrin, both successfully. In Sweden, three sites were treated with another synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin, all successfully. Defining the likely extent of population was critical in determining the feasibility of treatment, as well as the ability to treat the whole population effectively. Important constraints on projects included site size, habitat complexity, environmental risks, cooperation of landowners and funding availability. Successful projects were manageably small, had good project leadership, had cooperation from stakeholders, had access to resources and were carried out within one to three years. Factors influencing success included treating beyond the likely maximum geographical extent of the population and taking care to dose the treated area thoroughly (open water, plus the banks, margins, inflows and outflows). Recommendations are given on assessing the feasibility of biocide treatments and project-planning.

AB  - Recycling essential plant nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) from organic waste such as human and animal excreta will be an essential part of sustainable food systems and a circular economy. However, transportation is often cited as a major barrier to increased recycling as organic waste is heavy and bulky, and distances between areas of abundant waste may be far from areas with a need for fertilizers. We investigated the effect of increased input data spatial resolution to an optimization model on the weight, distance, and spatial patterns of transport. The model was run in Sweden and in Pakistan to examine cost-effectiveness of transporting excess excreta to areas of crop need after local recycling. Increasing the resolution of input data from political boundaries (municipalities and districts) to 0.083 decimal grids increased the amount of N requiring transport by 12% in Pakistan and increased P requiring transport by 14% in Sweden. The average distance decreased by 67% (to 44 km) in Pakistan but increased by 1 km in Sweden. Further increasing the resolution to 5 km grids in Sweden decreased the average transportation distance by 9 km (down to 123 km). In both countries, increasing resolution also decreased the number of long-distance heavy transports, and as such costs did not increase as much as total distance and weight transported. Ultimately, transportation in Pakistan seemed financially beneficial: the cost of transport only represented 13% of the NPK fertilizer value transported, and total recycling could even cover 78% of additional fertilizer purchases required. In Sweden, the cost of transporting excreta did not seem cost effective without valuing other potential benefits of increased recycling: costs were three times higher than the fertilizer value transported in excreta at the 5 km resolution. In summary, increasing input data resolution created a more realistic picture of recycling needs. This also highlighted more favorable cost to fertilizer value ratios which could make it easier to move forward with industry and government partners to facilitate productive recycling. Our analysis shows that in both countries increased recycling can result in better spatial nutrient balances.

AB  - The Pleistocene ice age and recent forest fragmentation have both played a significant role in shaping the population genetic variation of boreal coniferous species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and Eurasian coniferous forests. The Sichuan jay is one of the least know endemic bird species in QTP coniferous forests in western China while its sibling species, the Siberian Jay, is widespread within the coniferous forests in northern Eurasia. Here we used 11 microsatellite markers to assay genetic diversity across 58 Sichuan jay samples from China and 205 Siberian jay samples from Sweden and Russia. Results showed three distinct genetic clusters from the Sichuan jay sampling. Furthermore, the pair-wise F-ST values indicated high genetic differentiation not only among the two species but also between Swedish and Russian Siberian jay populations. What is more, a pattern of isolation by distance was found among the analyzed populations. Our study suggests that targeted habitat restoration in fragmented forests and more genetic work is urgently needed for conservation of the Sichuan jay.

AB  - The two latest IPCC assessment reports have concluded that knowledge is not sufficient for inducing action on climate change. This study problematizes the issue of going beyond business-as-usual through a study of the forestry sector in Sweden, which is a large economic sector and could be expected to be an early adapter, given that newly planted forest may stand some 70-90 years into the future. Therefore resources, economic motivation in the longer term and environmental foundations for early adaptation action could be expected to exist. This study draws upon the Foucauldian conceptualization of governmentality to explain the particular institutional logics that nevertheless lead to business-as-usual arguments dominating discussion on adaptation in the case of Swedish forestry. The study emphasizes that adaptation must be seen as steered and limited by existing institutional, social system logics, rather than by externally defined "rational" motivations. Efforts on adaptation to climate change must thus be considered in relation to, and seek to change, existing institutionally based motivational and incentive structures, and must thus be conceived through social rather than environmental logics. In fact, social logics may even define the types of actions that may be regarded as adaptations.

AB  - Generally, low flow in rivers occur as a result of extended period of dryness which is likely attributed to drought. Drought is a natural occurrence as an outcome of reduction in precipitation in a region for a long time. Hence, low flow is a growing concern as there are possibilities of more reduced flows in rivers. However, reservoirs can be utilized to mitigate negative effects on the supply of water in dry periods and supply water for other purposes. This study aims at verifying how the low flow condition of Glomma River in Norway has been progressively sustained by hydropower reservoirs. Water Evaluation and Planning Systems (WEAP) software was used for modelling the natural streamflow condition of Glomma River, which is the longest river in Norway, using two unregulated sub-basins within the Glomma catchment. Findings from this study presents that the period between January and March are critical periods in Glomma River. Results show that the values the annual minimum low flow gotten from the three gauges suggest the flow after regulation has increased significantly as opposed to before regulation. The daily average flow is simulated by WEAP to be an average of 100 m(3)/s during the low flow periods and an average discharge of 350 m(3)/s during the summer. However, the result indicates that the flow in the summer has reduced by 80% in majority of the years. In addition, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the two sub basins used for this study was 0.9 and 0.76, respectively. Also, the calculation of the coefficient of determination (R-2) resulted in 0.85 and 0.78 respectively for the two sub basins. In particular, findings from this study presents evidence on the low flow condition in Glomma River prior to its regulation and how the regulation has sustained the flow.

AB  - Planning is one of the envisioned strategies for reaching policy goals of urban social sustainability. However, the practical realization of this vision faces a number of challenges not least due to conflicts of interests and goals that arise in the planning process. There also seems to be a lack of understanding of the relationship between formal planning and social sustainability goals that are often normative and visionary. In order to bridge this knowledge gap, this paper investigates how urban social sustainability can be implemented in urban planning in the context of conflicts of interests and goals. In particular, we explore two questions: (i) whether and how planning procedures are interconnected with local policy goals for social sustainability; (ii) whether and how conflict affects the implementation of these goals through planning. The paper presents a qualitative case study of planning of temporary housing for immigrants in Gothenburg, Sweden, where a conflict of interests developed in conjunction with the planning. The local social sustainability goals are operationalized through the specific sub-goals of accessible and more equal living conditions, distribution of and equal access to housing for all groups in the community, and reduced social and ethnic segregation and discrimination in regard to housing. We identify shortcomings in the integration of local urban social sustainability goals into planning procedures and find that conflicts of interests as well as conflicts of priorities within and between the policy goals complicate their integration into formal planning procedures. More attention needs to be given to improved operationalization of the questions of priority and conflict resolution, both in planning and in urban social sustainability policy, if planning is to be considered a viable strategy for implementation of social sustainability goals.

AB  - Private forest owners' management decisions significantly impact the development of forest values in Sweden. This study explored the potential to develop environmental values on privately owned land in southern Sweden. Data were collected through interviews with 23 forest owners and analyzed with semantic content analysis. The interviewees owned estates of productive, predominantly coniferous forest ranging in size from 10-825 ha. They were aged 36-84, and 26% were female. Results showed that there is considerable potential to develop environmental values on private land since 1) Forest owners demonstrated multi-functional views of primarily social and emotional dimensions surrounding forest ownership, and the mindset of combining goals enables many different values to be developed, 2) Desired management showed numerous ideas that could bring a diversity of benefits, and 3) Practical management included various production-favoring measures, but even more for environmental, social, cultural, and emotional purposes that, largely unnoted, bring environmental conservation benefits. All forest owners perceived barriers to management and ownership, categorized primarily to structural or surrounding society factors. Financial incentives, policies encouraging forest owners' initiatives, an adequate supply of resources and sound management advice are suggested measures to reduce barriers and facilitate the development of environmental values.

AB  - The Geological Surveys of Finland and Norway, in co-operation with the Central Kola Expedition, Russia, are carrying out a major geochemical mapping project (1992-1996) of the western half of the Kola Peninsula and the adjacent areas in Norway and Finland (188 000 km(2)). A part of this project was a pilot study of the area surrounding the nickel industries in Nikel and Zapoljarnij, Russia, and the iron ore mine and mill in Kirkenes, Norway, using a variety of sample media. Snowpack samples taken at the end of the 1991-1992 winter proved to be well suited to characterising the industrial emissions in this area. By separately analysing meltwater and filter residues, water soluble and particulate emissions can be differentiated. Results show that, for the majority of elements, particles govern the total deposition chemistry. Four different sources of element input can be distinguished: (1) industrial emissions, (2) sea spray, (3) geogenic dust and (4) anthropogenic dust. Multi-element analysis, using ICP-MS, ICP-AES and ion chromatography, followed by regional mapping, showed that all the elements analysed for, namely Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cu, F, Fe, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Si, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, Y and Zn, show unusually high concentrations in the vicinity of the nickel industry in Russia.

AB  - It has been suggested that an increase in the area of low-intensity land-use on arable land (e.g. set-aside fields and short-rotation coppice), and high or increased farmland habitat heterogeneity, may halt or reverse the observed population decline of farmland birds. We tested these hypotheses by undertaking farmland bird censuses during two contrasting periods of agricultural policies and land-use (i.e. 1994 and 2004) in a farmland region covering a gradient of forest- to farmland-dominated landscapes in Sweden. Local species richness (i.e. at 3 hectare sites) declined significantly between 1994 and 2004. Local species richness was positively related to habitat heterogeneity in both years of study whereas temporal change in species richness was not. Local change in species richness was positively associated with a change in the proportion of non-rotational set aside and short-rotation coppice (i.e. low-intensity land-use forms), but also to changes in the amount of spring-sown crops. However, the effect of low-intensity land-Use was significantly dependent on the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. An increase in low-intensity land-use was linked to an increase (or less marked decrease) in species richness at sites located in open farmland surroundings but to a decrease in richness at sites located in forest surroundings. This interaction between amount of forest and low-intensity land-use could be interpreted as a "rare habitat effect", where an increase in a farmland habitat only positively affects biodiversity when it was originally uncommon (i.e. open farmland areas). Our results suggest that conservation measures of farmland biodiversity have to be put in a landscape context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In central Europe and to some degree in North America, the so called "new type" forest damages occur over large areas.  Various studies indicate the declines are more or less frequently associated with nutritional disturbances that have developed within rather short time periods.  The most common disorder is a Mg deficiency that produces specific discoloration symptoms such as tip-yellowing in Norway spruce.  But also K deficiencies and other disturbances exist in coniferous as well as in deciduous forests.  Good correlations between the site specific substrate chemistry and the actual nutritional status of the trees and stands were found.  To explain the sudden and widespread development of the forest declines adverse anthropogenic influences such as increased N and H+ deposition, land use and forestry mismanagement as well as natural stresses are discussed.  The hypothesized causal mechanisms are multiple, but include generally soil degradation processes associated with losses of alkaline nutrient ions from the rooted solum.  Recent and previous fertilization (and liming) experiments have shown that a fast and sustained revitalization and restabilization of declining forest ecosystems marked by nutrient deficiencies can be achieved.  This was demonstrated by chemical and histological foliar analyses and the visible improvement of the trees.  Soil analyses also revealed a positive change of the chemical soil status when site and stand specific fertilizer applications were utilized in the appropriate amounts.  However, under certain site and stand conditions risks and limitations exist that have to be evaluated when fertilization practices are discussed.  To overcome or minimize these influences the treatments must be adapted to the site, and stand specific fertilization needs as indicated by soil and foliar analysis, humus form, hydrologic parameter and atmospheric deposition rates.

Both regions have rich and related cultural histories, but at the same time exhibit striking differences in the role of cultural heritage and other aspects of heritage in regional identity narratives that are aimed at attracting tourists. We conclude that while the narratives of Sorlandet affirm a romantic, picturesque image of pre-industrial, societies, those in the Dutch Wadden Sea area frame this region as a pristine and timeless wilderness, in which human history has no place.

AB  - Beyond its traditional function of food production, agricultural land offers public amenities such as the protection of natural resources and landscape scenery. This study investigates the preferences of non-farmers and farmers for nine landscape scenarios in the Swiss lowlands. The nine landscapes were the result of a photo editing process combining three land-use types (arable crops, grassland and a mixture of both) and three proportions of ecological compensation areas (0%, 10% and 30%). The landscape photographs were randomly arranged on one page of a paper-based questionnaire which was sent to a random sample of 4000 Swiss households (non-farmers) and 500 farmers. The respondents (1376 non-farmers and 276 farmers) rated each landscape by attractiveness. Both non-farmers and farmers preferred a mixed land-use type or one dominated by arable crops over one dominated by grassland. Non-farmers' preference ratings were highly influenced by the proportion of ecological compensation areas (ECAs) in the rated landscape: Non-farmers rated a landscape with a mixed land-use type and 30% ECAs highest, whereas farmers rated a landscape dominated by arable crops and 10% ECAs highest. The results indicate that heterogeneous landscapes (mixed land use, high proportion of ECAs) influence scenic beauty positively. Thus, farming practices and agro-environment schemes such as ECAs can have an impact on the visual attractiveness of a landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims Accelerating high-latitude climate warming drives shrub expansion in open landscapes and alters species distributions and compositions of plant communities. Simultaneously, various land use practices cause disturbance to the vegetation. However, not much documentation exists on how long-term intensive land use disturbance modifies high-latitude vegetation under climate warming. Here, we study how the composition of boreal mountain plant communities has changed during three decades in response to heavy land use disturbance, related to ski resort construction and management, and how these changes compare to those observed in adjacent less disturbed communities. Location Iso-Syote, Finland. Methods We resurveyed vegetation along four elevational gradients (240-426 m a.s.l.) on a boreal mountain in 2013-14. After the original study in 1980, half of the gradients were subjected to continuous heavy land use disturbance, while the other half remained only slightly disturbed. All the gradients experienced a similar amount of macroclimatic warming over time. We analysed temporal changes in plant group covers, species richness and species' elevational range means in relation to disturbance levels and elevation. Results Under slight disturbance, the cover of shrubs increased on the originally open upper slopes and elevational range means of several species shifted upward. In contrast, heavy disturbance resulted in a uniform, yet modest, shrub cover increase along the whole elevational gradient and promoted both up- and downward shifts of species. Bryophyte cover decreased considerably over time, regardless of the disturbance level. Species richness increased throughout, yet more under heavy disturbance. Conclusions Long-term changes in boreal mountain vegetation are substantially influenced by heavy land use disturbance compared to less disturbed sites where the vegetation changes are more comparable to those expected under a warmer climate. Therefore, along with the climatic effects, land use effects on vegetation are important to consider in management actions and in projections of future vegetation.

AB  - Amphibians are undergoing enigmatic global declines variously attributed to a complex web of anthropogenic forces. Alien predators pose a fundamental threat to biodiversity generally that is predicted to be most acute in island ecosystems. While amphibian eggs and tadpoles are vulnerable to aquatic predators, the effect of predators on adult, reproducing frogs, which most influence amphibian population processes, is unknown. Here, we report on the responses of amphibian populations in the outer Finnish Archipelago to a long-term, large-scale removal of American mink (Mustela vison Schreb.), an invasive predator linked to recent biodiversity loss across Europe. Removal increased both the densities and distribution of common frogs (Rana temporaria L.) but not those of common toads (Bufo bufo L.), which appear to escape mink predation because of their unpalatable skin. Importantly, the largest benefits of mink removal to frog recovery were slow to appear as frogs apparently have a delayed maturation in these harsh environments, which means we must be cautious about reliance upon short-term results.

AB  - The ability to live the life one wants with public transport is one of the key factors of sustainable and inclusive societies. Given the current trend in the transport domain, providing accessible public transport is necessary in order to allow people to participate in their day-to-day activities without using a car. Using survey data obtained from Sweden, this study investigates factors that may have a negative effect on the perceived accessibility of public transportation in major city areas and other areas. Overall, regression analyses show that time and economic resources, organizational and temporal functions, frequent travel by public transport, and geographical context all act as accessibility barriers. These findings highlight the need not only to target increased mobility in urban environments, but also to turn the focus to the citizenry's perceived accessibility. These findings point to implications for policies, planning and interventions targeted at accessible public transport. Adopting an accessibility-oriented approach to urban development, including the individual perspective, could be a pathway for creating a socially sustainable transport system.

AB  - Land use and seasonal freezing is assumed to influence the transport of water and particles through the soil. The aim of this study was to identify, measure and interpret changes in soil pedality that could influence the transport of water and particles through the soil profile. The morphological, physical and chemical properties of three soils on a plateau in the Vansemb area, south eastern Norway, were compared. The soils have 60 to 90 cm thick silty sediments deposited above a marine clay substratum. One site had always been under natural forest vegetation. The second site had been afforested with spruce for 40 years after centuries of cattle grazing without ploughing. The third site had been under cultivation for about 70 years. Because of winter freezing, the upper horizons display a platy pedality created by the growth of ice segregation blades. This is followed by a desiccation structuration with vertical shrinking fissures lining a prismatic pedality in deeper horizons. As frost penetrates deeper in soils under crop and grassland, the platy structures are deeper in these sites and overlap with the vertical fissure system. As a result of tillage operations, the horizons below the plough layer became denser. This decrease in porosity is to some degree counterbalanced by the active ice segregation and the earthworm activity. Tillage operations are also responsible for the filling of the vertical fissure system with particles from the horizons above. The shift to crop or grassland increased bioturbation, mainly by earthworm populations. This activity remained at least partly preserved, even after 40 years of afforestation. Burrowing animals were absent from the mineral horizons of the forest soil. Comparative studies, as this one, ascertain the orientation of soil evolution; and thus provide essential information for soil management with minimal degradation and particle transport.

AB  - The regional research and development project ITU reacts to an ongoing change in the service infrastructure of the Finnish tourism industry. Finnish Tourist Board decided to renew its VisitFinland site (visitfinland.com) and change it to satisfy the demands of the present day. The target destination in this research and development project is the province of Eastern Uusimaa that lies about 50 kms east of Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The province with 90 000 inhabitants is a cultural destination with about 1 million annual visitors. The tourism industry in the province of Eastern Uusimaa is a network of small or micro companies that operate with minimal resources for development such as new products and target groups, networking and digital solutions or more sophisticated applications in the Internet. A web-based study explored the regional suppliers' attitudes towards e-commerce and business supported by electronic facilities and portals. Based on the results of the study, tourism suppliers seem to know and understand that e-commerce enables business growth and new customers. But we could not get any clear answer to what type of portal (a regional one or one covering the whole country) respondents would prefer. Discussions in the future and the ITU project are to pave the way for e-solutions in this small destination.

AB  - Traditional management of semi-natural grasslands by grazing or annual mowing is not always feasible and the current study set out to evaluate alternative management methods. At eleven locations in southern Sweden, block experiments were conducted evaluating seven treatments in 5 m*20 m plots: grazing, annual mowing, annual spring burning, mowing every third year, mechanical removal of woody plants, herbicide control of woody plants, and untreated control. After approximately 13 years, trends for woody plants and species richness, and the occurrence of management-dependent plant species, low-grown species, and pollinator-attracting plant species were analysed. Overall, the annual mowing and grazing treatments resulted in fewer woody plants, the highest species richness, and more management-dependent, low-grown, and pollinator-attracting species. The untreated control plots showed the opposite effect, whereas less intense management (annual burning, mowing every third year, and mechanical and chemical treatments of woody plants) showed mixed and often intermediate effects. Compared to grazing and mowing, less intense management methods do not constitute long-term management alter-natives to preserve typical features of species-rich grasslands. However, they may be short-term alternatives at sites where the recruitment of woody species is absent or rare. However, to prevent the encroachment of woody species, less intensive management might be a better long-term alternative at more productive sites with slow or inhibited woody species recruitment.

AB  - On behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, research has been carried out on how to make Swedish agriculture sustainable with regard to production capacity, environment and profitability. A future development of conventional agriculture (FC) and a future development of organic agriculture (FO) were studied. FC achieves the production and profitability goals as well as the goal of less nitrogen pollution, but not the goals for landscape management, bio-diversity and reduced pesticide use. FO achieves the three later goals, but not the goals for reduced nitrogen pollution and increased production capacity. The optimal solution is a "unified vision" consisting of most cereal, oil seed, root crop, pig and poultry production with FC technology and most hay, milk and beef production with FO technology.

AB  - In this analysis, we categorize the arguments and criticisms raised among Norwegians during the climate debate in the period 2007 to 2013. Our sources are based on two different samples of published texts about climate and measures for reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Through computer-assisted analysis we detect ten fairly distinct logics used systematically by various parties in presenting, advocating and/or criticizing various measures in the Norwegian debate. We describe qualitative and general moral aspects of the ten logics before explaining three overarching tendencies: (1) That market thinking (e.g. buying and selling CO2 quotas) was heavily criticized during the period, and less so towards the end of the period, (2) that what we call green thinking grew towards 2009-2010, but less prevalently after disputes in which bioenergy, forestry, ecological considerations and classic conservation confronted each other, while (3) that measures of industrial and technological solutions and consumer products seemed to get more focus towards the end of the period.

AB  - Governance collaborations between public and private partners are increasingly used to promote sustainable mountain development, yet information is limited on their nature and precise extent. This article analyzes collaboration on environment and natural resource management in Swedish mountain communities to critically assess the kinds of issues these efforts address, how they evolve, who leads them, and what functional patterns they exhibit based on Margerum's (2008) typology of action, organizational, and policy collaboration. Based on official documents, interviews, and the records of 245 collaborative projects, we explore the role of the state, how perceptions of policy failure may inspire collaboration, and the opportunities that European Union funds have created. Bottom-up collaborations, most of which are relatively recent, usually have an action and sometimes an organizational function. Top-down collaborations, however, are usually organizational or policy oriented. Our findings suggest that top-down and bottom-up collaborations are complementary in situations with considerable conflict over time and where public policies have partly failed, such as for nature protection and reindeer grazing. In less contested areas, such as rural development, improving tracks and access, recreation, and fishing, there is more bottom-up, action-oriented collaboration. State support, especially in the form of funding, is central to explaining the emergence of bottom-up action collaboration. Our findings show that the state both initiates and coordinates policy networks and retains a great deal of power over the nature and functioning of collaborative governance. A practical consequence is that there is great overlap-aggravated by sectorized approaches-that creates a heavy workload for some regional partners.

AB  - Climate-related targets for cities abound, but it is unclear how important they are in driving actual transformations. Scholars have often taken a skeptical view of official climate discourses, including their ambitious targets, and instead turned their attention to experimentation, innovation and civic action colloquially termed 'real action.' In this article we try on the opposite view. Contributing to 'speculative political ecology', we argue that climate-related targets, even those without hard policies directly attached to them, can render climate change more governable and actionable. In a fragmented, polycentric and dispersed governance landscape, the immutability of a 'hard' number can create coherence, direction and measurability to policy action. We examine a particular target, and its associated governance instruments, which has arguably had a transformative effect on urban policy. Our empirical focus is Norway's Zero Growth Objective in urban transport policy. We follow the target from its first formulation as a soft goal around 2006 and until 2019, by when it had materialized as a hard target shaping funding streams and concrete policy interventions, and most likely, emission levels. Arguably, it has been a highly effective frame for policy.

AB  - The increasing development of recreational resorts and second homes in mountain regions worldwide require substantial infrastructure, and have large impact on habitats and ecosystems. We hypothesized that developed areas would attract predators and lead to higher predation on willow ptarmigan and lower their abundance. In a 500-km(2) study area in south-central Norway, we sampled the density of territorial cocks in spring and the breeding success of willow ptarmigan along a 3-km gradient extending out from clusters of cabins. We also sampled red fox scats and corvid birds and measured nest predation on artificial nests across this gradient. Densities of cocks in the spring and of adults and brood sizes in August did not vary along the gradient. However, the density of chicks in August was higher beyond 1.5 km from cabin areas, presumably because more hens lost their clutches in the vicinity of cabins. This was supported by the results from the artificial nest experiment where significantly more nests were depredated near cabin areas than further away. The number of scats of red fox along trails increased with distance from cabins, whereas more corvid birds were observed near cabins. We conclude that corvid birds were the main cause of higher loss of ptarmigan nests near cabin areas, which led to lower production of chicks. Breeding density, however, did not seem to vary along the gradient, presumably because of suitable habitat for breeding and little human activity in these areas during the period of pair formation and nesting.

AB  - LaProf was a multilateral project that aimed at promoting language awareness to immigrating workforces in two particular sectors, ICT and agriculture. The main goal was to provide free access to online language learning resources that would help candidate immigrants get more familiarized with the terminology and cultural issues in their sectors, through developing and disseminating a number of language learning exercises. The main idea of the project was to encourage ICT teachers living in Estonia (and Baltics in general) to learn Finnish and give them assistance in an overall immigration process to Finland by increasing their knowledge about working environment and culture of the target country. Accordingly, LaProf aimed to teach Greek and cultural issues to agricultural specialists living in Romania, who want to move and work in Greece. Significant attention was given to encouraging the learning of under-representing European languages (Finnish and Greek) as foreign languages in order to help European citizens from Estonia and Romania to understand better the working environment and culture of the targeted countries (i.e. Finland and Greece). In addition, the instructions of LaProf language learning exercises are translated into widely spoken EU languages (English and French) as well as into Hungarian, Romanian, Estonian and Russian, which are notably less widely used and taught languages in Europe. LaProf developed and promoted language learning methodologies and resources that motivate the particular categories of language learners, in order to enhance their capacity for language learning. As the main output 656 interactive language learning exercises were developed for its clearly defined user groups. A series of piloting tests were applied to a specified target group, the final outputs being thus optimized to the maximum. The targeted learning resources are focused on language learning of the targeted languages, but also reflect the embedded cultural context of the destination countries and sectors.

AB  - Context One approach to maintain the resilience of biotic communities is to protect the variability of abiotic characteristics of Earth's surface, i.e. geodiversity. In terrestrial environments, the relationship between geodiversity and biodiversity is well recognized. In streams, the abiotic properties of upstream catchments influence stream communities, but the relationships between catchment geodiversity and aquatic biodiversity have not been previously tested. Objectives The aim was to compare the effects of local environmental and catchment variables on stream biodiversity. We specifically explored the usefulness of catchment geodiversity in explaining the species richness on stream macroinvertebrate, diatom and bacterial communities. Methods We used 3 geodiversity variables, 2 land use variables and 4 local habitat variables to examine species richness variation across 88 stream sites in western Finland. We used boosted regression trees to explore the effects of geodiversity and other variables on biodiversity. Results We detected a clear effect of catchment geodiversity on species richness, although the traditional local habitat and land use variables were the strongest predictors. Especially soil-type richness appeared as an important factor for species richness. While variables related to stream size were the most important for macroinvertebrate richness and partly for bacterial richness, the importance of water chemistry and land use for diatom richness was notable. Conclusions In addition to traditional environmental variables, geodiversity may affect species richness variation in streams, for example through changes in water chemistry. Geodiversity information could be used as a proxy for predicting stream species richness and offers a supplementary tool for conservation efforts.

AB  - The importance of essential fish habitat in supporting commercial fisheries has received increasing attention in recent years. Bottom trawling is known to cause particularly destructive damage to habitat that is effectively non-renewable, such as cold water corals. This paper applies the production function approach to estimate the link between cold water corals and redfish in Norway. Both the carrying capacity and growth rate of redfish are found to be functions of cold water coral habitat and thus cold water corals can be considered an essential fish habitat. The paper also estimates a facultative relationship between cold water coral and redfish stocks. The essential habitat model shows the best fit to the data. Comparative statics of an essential habitat indicate an approximate annual loss in harvest of between 11 and 29% within the bounds of coral decline estimated by scientists. In terms of policy, our results indicate that essential fish habitat protection should be considered when managing commercially important species.

AB  - Although Lake Vanern is the largest freshwater reservoir in Western Europe, it remains relatively unknown to the scientific community outside of Scandinavia. Therefore, we aim to give a brief outline of the lake and its geological history, in particular the landscape transformation, resource utilization, pollution history, and environmental development of the region. The landscape around Lake Vanern was shaped into its present form during the latest glaciations some 10,000years ago. Large variation exists in its tributaries, with forest in the north and agricultural areas in the south. Human influence on the landscape was relatively small until the mid-18(th) century. Later, in the mid-19(th) century, the agriculture, forestry and shipping industries underwent large transformations as the towns around the lake grew and the economy changed. Development of fishing equipment, processes and changes in catching methods industrialized the fishing industry after mid-20(th) century. In the 1960s the lake was considered to be one of the most heavily mercury-polluted lakes in the world. After the passing of the first national environmental protection law in Sweden the lake turned into a success story: It has been declared to be healthy. However, old pollution still affects the fishing industry. With this new focus on the environment, the scientific community started to be interested in the lake. The lake has also played a very important role as the largest hydropower reservoir in Sweden. Here, too, the environmental question is in focus and the effects of the water regulation are still under debate. The result has been loss of biodiversity and an increased risk of an inflow of invasive species from international shipping. However, still many questions remain to be answered regarding the lake and effect of ongoing climate change on the sustainable development of the lake region.

AB  - Indicator classifications help us to focus on the most relevant groups of species in monitoring the effects of land use changes on biodiversity. We studied changes in distribution area of 74 butterfly species preferring one of the three common habitats of boreal agricultural landscapes: semi-natural grasslands (35 species), arable field margins (7) and forest edges (32). Using extensive atlas data from four time periods during the last 50 years in Finland, we quantified trends in the occupancy of the species in 10 km grid squares, and classified them into four classes: declining (23), stable (17), increasing (27) and fluctuating (7) species. Trends among the species favouring three habitats were different: 60% of the species of semi-natural grasslands had declined, whereas 86% of the species typical of open field margins had increased. An increase also predominated in species associated with forest edges. Declining and increasing species differed in three ecological characteristics: increasing species were more mobile, utilized a wider range of habitats and, based on their larval host plants, lived in more eutrophic habitats than declining species. Species overwintering as adults showed more positive trends in occupancy than species overwintering as eggs, larvae or pupae. Observed trends in occupancy are in good agreement with long-term changes in land use and habitat availability in Finland: a long-continued decrease in the area of semi-natural grasslands and an increased amount of open forest edges and clearings due to modern forestry during the past 50 years.

AB  - Changes in forest landscape structure have been suggested as a likely contributing factor behind the long-term decline in the numbers of cyclic grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in northern Fennoscandian lowland regions in contrast to mountain regions due to the absence of forest management in the mountains. This study, for the first time, formally explored landscape structure in 29 lowland (LF) and 14 mountain forest (MF) landscapes (each 2.5 x 2.5 km) in northern Sweden, and related the results to the cumulated spring trapping index of the grey-sided vole in 2002-2006. The grey-sided vole showed striking contrasts in dynamics close in space and time. The MF landscapes were characterized by larger patches and less fragmentation of preferred forest types. The grey-sided vole was trapped in all of 14 analyzed MF landscapes but only in three out of 29 of the LF landscapes. MF and LF landscapes with grey-sided vole occurrence were characterized by similar focal forest patch size (mean 357 ha, minimum 82 ha and mean 360 ha, minimum 79 ha, respectively). In contrast, these MF compared to the LF landscapes were characterized by larger patches of preferred forest types and less fragmented preferred forest types and by a lower proportion of clear-cut areas. The present results suggest that landscape structure is important for the abundance of grey-sided voles in both regions. However, in the mountains the change from more or less seasonal dynamics to high-amplitude cycles between the mid 1990s and 2000s cannot be explained by changes in landscape structure.

AB  - The Western diet is characterized by high meat consumption, which negatively affects the environment and human health. Transitioning toward eating more plant-based products in Western societies has been identified as a key instrument to tackle these problems. However, one potential concern is that radically reducing meat in the current diet might lead to deficiencies in nutritional intake. In this paper, we explore a scenario in which meat consumption in Sweden is reduced by 50% and replaced by domestically grown grain legumes. We quantify and discuss the implications for nutritional intake on population level, consequences for agricultural production systems and environmental performance. The reduction in meat consumption is assumed to come primarily from a decrease in imported meat. We use data representing current Swedish conditions including the Swedish dietary survey, the Swedish food composition database, Statistics Sweden and existing life cycle assessments for different food items. At population level, average daily intake of energy and most macro- and micro-nutrients would be maintained within the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations after the proposed transition (e.g., for protein, fat, zinc, vitamin B12 and total iron). The transition would also provide a considerable increase in dietary fiber and some increase in folate intake, which are currently below the recommended levels. The transition scenario would increase total area of grain legume cultivation from 2.2% (current level) to 3.2% of Swedish arable land and is considered technically feasible. The climate impact of the average Swedish diet would be reduced by 20% and the land use requirement by 23%. There would be a net surplus of approximately 21,500 ha that could be used for bioenergy production, crop production for export, nature conservation, etc. Implementation of this scenario faces challenges, such as lack of suitable varieties for varying conditions, lack of processing facilities to supply functional legume-based ingredients to food industries and low consumer awareness about the benefits of eating grain legumes. In sum, joint efforts from multiple actors are needed to stimulate a decrease in meat consumption and to increase cultivation and use of domestically grown grain legumes.

AB  - Large carnivores are recolonizing areas of their historical range in Europe. This process has strong implications for conservation and management related to human-wildlife conflicts. Analyses and modelling of the observed mechanisms of spatial expansion can predict recolonization patterns under human influences. We demonstrate how spatially-explicit, agent-based models can assist to identify and predict how humans impact shape large carnivore recolonizations. Using detailed data obtained through long-term surveillance of wolf territories, we identified the mechanisms of recolonization and predicted the spatio-temporal patterns of expansion of the wolf in the Scandinavian Peninsula. We disentangled the observed mechanisms of expansion to develop WOLVES (Wolf Virtual Expansion Simulator), an agent-based model software. We applied the model to investigate in silico the observed lack of wolf recolonization into the suitable but densely human-populated area of southern Sweden and projected the expansion into the future. We tested the impact of traffic barriers and territory termination (wolf mortality most likely due to culling and poaching) on the observed recolonization in the south. Simulations identified that traffic infrastructures impacted only at configurations of insurmountable barriers unlikely to occur in Scandinavia, while low rates of territory termination had a major impact on the recolonization. Simulating until 2030 predicts that wolves will not colonize southern Sweden, which highlights the complexities of this process in areas of increased human-influence. The capability of simulators to test hypotheses and discriminate constraints of future population development makes them a valuable tool for ecologists, managers, and decision-makers involved in regional and transboundary conservation challenges of large carnivore recolonizations.

AB  - Erosion of biodiversity generated by anthropogenic activities has been studied for decades and in many areas at the species level, using taxa monitoring. In contrast, genetic erosion within species has rarely been tracked, and is often studied by inferring past population dynamics from contemporaneous estimators. An alternative to such inferences is the direct examination of past genes, by analysing museum collection specimens. While providing direct access to genetic variation over time, historical DNA is usually not optimally preserved, and it is necessary to apply genotyping methods based on hybridization-capture to unravel past genetic variation. In this study, we apply such a method (i.e., HyRAD), to large time series of two butterfly species in Finland, and present a new bioinformatic pipeline, namely PopHyRAD, that standardizes and optimizes the analysis of HyRAD data at the within-species level. In the localities for which the data retrieved have sufficient power to accurately examine genetic dynamics through time, we show that genetic erosion has increased across the last 100 years, as revealed by signatures of allele extinctions and heterozygosity decreases, despite local variations. In one of the two butterflies (Erebia embla), isolation by distance also increased through time, revealing the effect of greater habitat fragmentation over time.

AB  - This article addresses the issue of to what extent forest certification schemes contribute to the enhancement of environmental protection in Swedish forestry. Our assessment is built on the analysis of three different data sets, namely: 1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI), 2) the Swedish Database for Forest Owner Analysis, presenting data on small-scale forestry practices and certification, and 3) a follow-up mail survey addressed to private small-scale forest owners with certified forest properties. Our NFI analysis indicated some minor improvements in forest conditions, corresponding with the interim target for enhanced biological diversity (dead wood, broad-leaved trees and old forests). The improvements were less evident on large-scale forest properties (certified in accordance with the Forest Stewardship Council scheme) than on small-scale private forest properties (mainly certified in accordance with the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes). This contradicts a common assumption that a much higher degree of certification with stricter environmental standards will give more evident positive impacts on environmental conditions. However, results from the follow-up survey showed that more harvesting activity had taken place on certified small-scale forest properties than on non-certified properties. This could mean more negative effects on biodiversity. We conclude by stressing the importance of improving quantitative methods for determining a cause-and-effect relationship between certification and nature protection: previous research tends to report rather far-reaching conclusions based on limited data sets.

AB  - Many wader populations around the world are declining as a consequence of habitat degradation or loss. It is therefore important to identify species-specific habitat demands accurately and to define the important factors explaining species distribution, in order to develop tools that can be used in conservation planning. The aim of this study is to create reliable, functional and ecologically interpretable predictive distribution models for five breeding wader species.
   The archipelago of SW Finland in the Baltic Sea.
   We used multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to create single-species and multiresponse distribution models based on 525 study islands and 12 abiotic and biotic environmental variables. Model evaluation was carried out on independent data not used in model building (100 + 116 islands). The models were tested for discrimination with receiver-operating characteristic statistics and for calibration with Millers calibration statistics (MCS).
   The single-species models for the turnstone (Arenaria interpres), redshank (Tringa totanus) and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) showed good predictive abilities, regarding both discrimination and calibration, when evaluated on independent data. The multiresponse models for the less prevalent species, common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) and the common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) had better discriminative abilities than the single-species models. The most influential predictor overall was occurrence of small larids. Exposure, area of forest and low and flat areas were also important, as well as shore habitats.
   We found that the ability of MARS to fit non-linear and multiresponse models makes it a useful method to quantitatively relate species occurrence to environmental characteristics of a complex environment.

AB  - Over the past three decades in boreal Sweden, there has been a long-term decline of cyclic sympatric voles, leading to local extinctions of the most affected species, the grey-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus). We monitored this decline by snap-trapping on 58 permanent plots spread over 100 km(2) in spring and fall from fall 1971-2003. The reason for the decline is largely unknown, although a common major factor is likely to be involved in the decline of C. rufocanus and of the coexisting voles. However, here we deal with the reasonability of one complementary hypothesis, the habitat fragmentation hypothesis, which assumes that part of the decline of C. rufocanus is caused by habitat (forest) destruction. There was considerable local variation in the decline among the 58 1-ha sampling plots, with respect to both density and timing of the decline; however, all declines ended up with local extinction almost without exception. Local declines were not associated with habitat destruction by clear-cutting within sampling-plots, as declines started about equally often before as after clear-cutting, which suggested that habitat destruction outside sampling plots could be involved. In a multiple regression analysis, local habitat preference (LHP; expressed as a ratio of observed to expected number of voles trapped per habitat) together with two habitat variables in the surrounding (2.5 x 2.5 km(2)) landscape matrix explained 56% of the variation among local cumulated densities of C. rufocanus and hence of local time-series. LHP was positively correlated and explained 31% of the variation, while connectivity among clear-cuts was negatively correlated and proximity among xeric-mesic mires was positively correlated and explained additional 16% and 9%, respectively. Even if the overall decline cannot be connected to local clear-cutting on sampling-plots, clear-cutting and hence habitat fragmentation/destruction in the surrounding landscapes potentially influenced grey-sided vole numbers negatively.

AB  - Key message Bird assemblages in planted spruce (Picea abies L.) forests were compositionally distinct from those in naturally regenerated mixed stands. Despite rapid stand development on productive soils, even-aged silviculture cannot host most old-forest species. However, their habitat quality could be supported in landscape mosaics with retention forestry and set-asides. Context The most productive forest lands have naturally the richest bird assemblages but tend to be also most intensively managed. Sustainable solutions to this conflict are unclear. Aim To assess bird assemblages and their successional dynamics in planted Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands compared to naturally developing stands. Methods We mapped breeding bird assemblages in forty 5-ha plots on highly productive soils in Estonia. The plots included sets of naturally regenerated and planted stands, and (as successional endpoints) clear-cuts and old stands. Results Planted stands had fewer bird species and pairs than naturally regenerated stands; the latter having a species composition resembling late-successional deciduous-dominated stands. Importantly, the species composition in mature spruce plantations converged toward the composition observed in late-successional conifer-dominated stands. Downed dead wood, stand age, deciduous trees, and stock density were the most significant stand characteristics shaping bird assemblages. Conclusion The habitat value of established spruce plantations can be primarily improved by allowing for some deciduous trees and gaps with deciduous undergrowth. At the landscape scale, the bird diversity of even-aged systems would be enhanced by multi-scale applications of retention forestry-from retention trees to old-growth set-asides.

AB  - Housing plays an important role in the development of welfare policies and also often in achieving sustainability goals. There exists, however, implementation gaps between policies and practices in urban development and housing. Here it should be possible to draw lessons from policy implementations in the past. In this article we explore the strategies of the Swedish central government in implementing a social housing policy in the mid-20th century. The policy was successfully implemented in that it resulted in the rapid expansion and modernisation of the Swedish apartment stock in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and acute housingshortages and poor housing standards were overcome. The main lesson learned from the Swedish case study is the critical role of the central government in implementation through the strategic coordination of policy aims, instruments, stakeholders and interests throughout the implementation process. Although the central government could have used hard, almost authoritarian policy instruments to force the realisation of the new policy, it mainly used soft policy tools and focused on coordination. In the contemporary networked governance setting, the central government, like no other player, still has the potential to guide and coordinate implementation processes for the realization of sustainable housing visions.

AB  - This study proposes a unit of analysis based on cultural historical activity theory for examining the development of organic farming (OF) concepts. The study investigates whether organic farms are becoming more like conventional farms, with related environmental and social problems. The framework is illustrated with a historical analysis of the Swedish case of organic apple farming. The analysis shows that in Sweden, conventionalization is part of the current dominant "intensive organic farming concept", while an emerging concept, the "ecology of food systems", is attempting to break free from this process. The proposed analytical framework can be used for comparing OF concepts and for guiding future development efforts according to the needs of stakeholders.

AB  - Earlier land use in European mountains included grazing by different kinds of livestock, while today it may be more homogenous, and the grazing may have either been intensified or been abandoned. Different domestic animal species graze in different areas of the landscape. Therefore, grazing stocks composed of different species have an unequal effect on the landscape. This study compares the influence of four domestic animal species (cattle, sheep, goats, reindeer) on landscape dynamics in Jotunheimen, a Norwegian mountain range. Interviews and maps showing grazing land of domestic animals were performed to collect information about land use in the summer farm surroundings. Grazing pressure maps (prior to 1960 and 1960-2002) using the land use information obtained, and vegetation maps (from the 1960s and 2002) using aerial photographs, were digitized. Vegetation was spatially linked with grazing pressure using GIS and multiple multinomial and linear regressions were used to investigate each species' effect on vegetation type change and displacement of the forest line, respectively. The results show that cattle grazing influenced transitions from grasslands, cattle together with goats affected transitions from heaths, and cattle, goats, and reindeer influenced displacement of the birch forest line. High grazing pressure from these three domestic animals suppressed forest and scrub establishment in open habitats. Only goats, however, caused transitions from scrub and birch forest to open vegetation types. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeThe European Union (EU) aims to become climate-neutral by 2050. Achieving this requires targeted measures and strategies. One of the instruments of the EU is the EU taxonomy, a classification system with the purpose of creating a common definition of what economic activities are deemed sustainable. The paper aims to examine how the EU taxonomy can affect the Norwegian construction industry, property owners and facilities management (FM) providers. Design/methodology/approachThe research is based on a document analysis and interviews with main stakeholders within the financial sector, construction and real estate (RE) sector, authorities, environmental organisations and businesses related to FM and RE. FindingsThe findings show that different stakeholders share largely similar attitudes towards the taxonomy, although some differ in their opinions. This paper finds that there are high levels of uncertainty and confusion associated with the taxonomy, which can be said to be a major obstacle for successful implementation. Several stakeholders show concerns related to the fact that Norway lacks definitions and regulations on which the taxonomy is based. The requirements for new buildings and existing buildings are considered stricter than the current practice in the Norwegian construction and RE industry, while the requirements for renovation are considered more achievable. The uptake of the EU taxonomy will impact the FM and the urban FM practices and standards for the procurement of services, and the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies must be developed. Research limitations/implicationsThe research presented in this paper was conducted at a time when the EU taxonomy was a relatively unknown concept in the Norwegian construction and RE industry. FM providers were not interviewed in this study. Practical implicationsThis research is one of the first studies to be conducted on this topic in Norway and represents the first meeting between the EU taxonomy and the industry. The discussion underpins the relevance of adjusting and updating FM standards to today's knowledge about ESG principles. Originality/valueThe paper shows the viewpoint of the Norwegian stakeholders involved in the construction and RE industry. This gives valuable information about the challenges that the industry needs to overcome.

AB  - Using an inductive quantitative approach, this article examines empirically the main characteristics of upland farming in the northern periphery of Sweden. This approach allows us to stepwise 'reconstruct' upland farming in its north Swedish manifestation. The data features farm-level and aggregated data from four municipalities stretching from the Bothnian Golf to the Norwegian border. The combination of GIS and advanced statistical analysis (clustering and regression) provides a robust evidence-base characterising upland farming at the nexus of multiple dimensions: territoriality (e.g. remote location, harsh climate, scattered settlement structure), style (e.g. labour extensive, small-scale, mixed fanning) and livelihood (e.g. plurlactive, diversification, subsidy dependent). The article emphasizes the potentially central role of upland farming in bringing into coherent policy initiatives promoting sustainable community development in the periphery. The study also looks ahead and urges scholars to adopt more systematically mixed methods in future upland farming studies in order to render the complexity of this socio-spatial phenomenon.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to collate information on potential measures. to reduce phosphorus (P) losses, with particular reference to Sweden. In Sweden, three dominant types of soils or soil profiles are at risk of suffering from high P losses through different pathways: clay soils with a naturally poor structure, usually situated on the large central plains, are prone to lose P through drain tiles; silty soils, usually situated on hilly terrain, are prone to erosion, and. sandy soils with a low P sorption capacity in both topsoil and subsoil and that have had heavy applications of fertilisers, are prone to high leaching losses. Fields with such soils and landscape position with connectivity to surface waters may lose more than 0.5 kg P ha year(-1) and often more than 1 kg P ha year(-1). Losses of soluble reactive P (SRP) are commonly 30-50% of the total P losses., Improved soil tillage together with other measures aimed at improving soil structure are suggested to have the best potential to reduce losses, with short-term and long-term effects, for the clayey and silty soil profiles. For. the silty soils, keeping the surface densely vegetated in winter and liming backfill of the drainage systems are suggested to be important ways to reduce the losses of particulate P (PartP). For sandy soils prone to P leaching, appropriate application of fertiliser and improved contact between fertiliser and the soil may be one of the few effective ways to reduce SRP losses.

AB  - This study examines the structure and composition of landscapes surrounding ponds with and without great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) - a species that needs an aquatic and a terrestrial environment. We related presence and absence data to 31 local and landscape variables, in a total of 143 areas in south-central Sweden. Land-use variables were measured within the radii of 100 m (local scale) and 500 m (landscape scale) surrounding the ponds. To find drivers of the distribution of great crested newts we used a principal component analysis (PCA) and a logistic regression analysis. Higher amounts of deciduous forest and pasture, together with proximity to deciduous forest seem to be positive for presence of great crested newts. Coniferous forest and mire appear to have a negative effect on the habitat quality for the species. We argue that management of the great crested newt should to a greater extent include the terrestrial habitat. Special attention should also be given to identifying and securing older, deciduous-rich forest in the vicinity of breeding ponds.

AB  - Maritime spatial planning (MSP) and fishery management may generate extra costs for fisheries by constraining fishers activity with conservation areas and new utilizations of the sea. More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects. The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.

AB  - Urban water services can be considered a part of municipal services, including the technical solution from water source to water treatment and distribution, and also wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge back to natural waters. The main aspect is how comprehensive water services concerning the whole society should be considered in urban development. This article emphasizes the necessary role of water services in community technical services and analyzes its critical functions. To keep urban water services on a sound environmental and health level even in externally or internally changing situations is considered sustainable and resilient. In our study, we used sequential PESTEL SWOT analysis to review the results of previous studies. The conclusions and recommendations are based on practices and governance of urban water services in Finland. Furthermore, the significance of water services for the economic development of a community cannot be ignored.

AB  - Lakes are an essential element of some of the world's most popular tourism destinations. One of the most relevant resources of lake and coastal tourism, in general, is climate. Due to the climate change, the characteristics of tourism market may be rearranged to a significant degree. In this paper, the authors intend to discuss the topic from an aspect that has been in a focal point to a limited degree, i.e. to forecast the possible effects of global climate change in Hungarian and Finnish lakes. We can be certain that in case the impacts of the climate change have an influence on tourism, such will be effect mainly coastal and mountain areas. Consequently, we must prepare for the prevention of such problems in tourism destinations at riversides and lakes.

AB  - The paper investigates whether and how regional public transport plans in Sweden address issues of social justice. Drawing upon a theoretical and analytical framework based on Young's concept of domination and using a critical discourse analysis conducted on regional transport plans in three Swedish regions (Skane, Stockholm and Vastra Gotaland), we identify discourses potentially resulting from and reproducing domination dynamics. The analysis highlights the centrality of economic growth goals and the framing of public transport users as customers not involved in the decision-making processes, which contradicts the declared justice and sustainability aims of the plans.

AB  - The draining of mires for silvicultural purposes has caused one of the most dramatic changes in the landscape during the last century in Finland. To study the effects of mire drainage, carabid beetle assemblages were sampled using pitfall trapping in three different mire habitat types. Carabids were sampled from mires in their natural state, drained mires and drained mires with an open power line to see whether the cleared power line can serve as an alternative habitat for mire dependent carabids. The draining of mires greatly increases the species richness of the carabid assemblages. Yet, the conservation value of the environment has dropped following the draining, since only common and abundant forest carabids have benefited from human impact. The role of the open power line as an alternative habitat for mire specialists remains questionable. A few carabid species have, however, benefited from the open habitat of the power line. The vegetation structure had a significant effect in determining the compositions of the carabid assemblages on the studied habitat types. It seems that mire dwelling carabids cannot survive on the drained mires, unless at least some characteristics, other than the mere openness of the cleared power lines, of natural mires remain.

AB  - We measured volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) at an urban background site near the city centre of Helsinki, Finland, northern Europe. The VOC and CO2 measurements were obtained between January 2013 and September 2014 whereas for CO a shorter measurement campaign in April-May 2014 was conducted. Both anthropogenic and biogenic sources were identified for VOCs in the study. Strong correlations between VOC fluxes and CO fluxes and traffic rates indicated anthropogenic source of many VOCs. The VOC with the highest emission rate to the atmosphere was methanol, which originated mostly from traffic and other anthropogenic sources. The traffic was also a major source for aromatic compounds in all seasons whereas isoprene was mostly emitted from biogenic sources during summer. Some amount of traffic-related isoprene emissions were detected during other seasons but this might have also been an instrumental contamination from cycloalkane products. Generally, the observed VOC fluxes were found to be small in comparison with previous urban VOC flux studies. However, the differences were probably caused by lower anthropogenic activities as the CO2 fluxes were also relatively small at the site.

AB  - This article presents an example of developing tourism curriculum content in regional cooperation to support the growth and competitiveness of international tourism in the Central Baltic Area. The whole area should be developed as a common tourism destination, but lack of suitable skills and availability of skilled workforce hinders the development. The necessary skills and knowledge were identified by considering the context and potential applications of skills and knowledge. The data were collected in Latvia and Finland by interviewing the tourism stakeholders (n = 76). The analysis resulted in five categories of skills and knowledge: product and experience development, multi-channel sales and marketing communication, multi-sectorality and cooperation, managing business operations, cultural awareness and internationalization. It can be concluded that the stakeholders identified mostly operational level skills and knowledge required by the SMEs. They did not deem important the skills and knowledge at the strategic level to facilitate management and development of destinations.

AB  - Multi-criteria forest ecosystem management considers the overall evaluation of alternative management plans with respect to objectives, which typically deal with both ecological and economic issues. One approach is to make the evaluations quantitatively so that analyses based on trade-offs between decision criteria can be carried out. This requires that the ecological objectives should also be assessed numerically. The present paper studies the numerical assessment of ecological values of forest ecosystem management in the context of multi-criteria planning. In a case study concerning planning applied to a forest area in Kainuu, eastern Finland, the ecological values were described by the amount of old forest, the amount of dead wood and the amount of deciduous trees. Compared to previous models, recently developed statistical modelling techniques were applied to handle the assessment process. The advantages of the statistical approach included that the potential interactions between the ecological variables can be taken into account. The case study results showed statistically significant interactions between the amount of old forest and the amount of dead wood suggesting that the proposed model is of practical importance for multi-criteria forest ecosystem management.

AB  - Following the July 22, 2011, Oslo bombing and shootings at the Utoya youth camp Norway became embroiled in a conflict over commemorative ethics. The memorial initially selected in an international contest, Memory Wound by Jonas Dahlgren, drew opposition from victims' families and local residents for its severe impact on the natural landscape. Plans for installation were cancelled in 2017. This controversy, we submit, must be contextualized in relation to the Norwegian justice system's handling of Anders Breivik, the perpetrator whose criminal proceedings were kept relatively secluded. We demonstrate how the design of Memory Wound and the suppression of Breivik's publicity reflect a symbolic logic traceable to a national imaginary of Norwegian exceptionalism. By interpretively aligning the use of negative space in Memory Wound with the muting of Breivik as a media event, we investigate the prescriptive force of symbols to inculcate world views. Specifically, we attend to the foreclosure of "prosthetic memory," which through media circulation allows people to engage with memory that is not primarily theirs. We acknowledge the possibility of empathy across difference that Landsberg ascribes to prosthetic memory; however, we insist that the circumstances under which solidarity might be rejected must be considered. With a dual case study, we offer a perspective on enduring assumptions about cultural identity and the rise of rightwing extremism in Northern Europe.

AB  - We present quantitative reconstructions of regional vegetation cover in north-western Europe, western Europe north of the Alps, and eastern Europe for five time windows in the Holocene [around 6k, 3k, 0.5k, 0.2k, and 0.05k calendar years before present (bp)] at a 1 degrees x1 degrees spatial scale with the objective of producing vegetation descriptions suitable for climate modelling. The REVEALS model was applied on 636 pollen records from lakes and bogs to reconstruct the past cover of 25 plant taxa grouped into 10 plant-functional types and three land-cover types [evergreen trees, summer-green (deciduous) trees, and open land]. The model corrects for some of the biases in pollen percentages by using pollen productivity estimates and fall speeds of pollen, and by applying simple but robust models of pollen dispersal and deposition. The emerging patterns of tree migration and deforestation between 6k bp and modern time in the REVEALS estimates agree with our general understanding of the vegetation history of Europe based on pollen percentages. However, the degree of anthropogenic deforestation (i.e. cover of cultivated and grazing land) at 3k, 0.5k, and 0.2k bp is significantly higher than deduced from pollen percentages. This is also the case at 6k in some parts of Europe, in particular Britain and Ireland. Furthermore, the relationship between summer-green and evergreen trees, and between individual tree taxa, differs significantly when expressed as pollen percentages or as REVEALS estimates of tree cover. For instance, when Pinus is dominant over Picea as pollen percentages, Picea is dominant over Pinus as REVEALS estimates. These differences play a major role in the reconstruction of European landscapes and for the study of land cover-climate interactions, biodiversity and human resources.

AB  - Galium sect. Leptogalium Lange in NE Europe is represented by few, local endemic species which occur in the area covered by the continental ice sheet in the Pleistocene period. They are: G. cracoviense Ehrend. in S Poland, G. oelandicum (Sterner & Hyl.) Ehrend. in SE Sweden and G. sudeticum Tausch in SW Poland and N Czech Republic. 55 individuals from live populations of these species were analysed using AFLP markers. A total of 193 AFLP bands were detected using three combinations of primers; out of them 159 proved polymorphic (82.4%). The lowest values of Shannon's index and Nei's gene diversity were noted for G. oelandicum and the highest ones for G. sudeticum. The results indicate a relatively high level of genetic variability in each of endemic species in spite of that the studied species occupy very small areas and are represented by a low number of populations. We conclude that additional, demographic and genetic studies are necessary to monitor potential decrease of populations' size resulting mainly from the mechanical destruction of plants and their habitats caused by intense tourism or other human activities (as agriculture, e.g. grazing).

AB  - Simple Summary
   Chronic Wasting Disease is a deadly infectious disease affecting cervids that was discovered in Norway in 2016. CWD can transmit through environmental reservoirs and aggregation and spatial clustering of animals may affect transmission. Deer usually forage on scattered forage, but anthropogenic food sources are often concentrated in space, leading to spatial aggregation. We determined what caused red deer to revisit the same locations in the environment, and the extent to which this was caused by anthropogenic food sources. We document that the most visited sites were indeed anthropogenic, which opens potential avenues to disease mitigation.
   Herbivores like cervids usually graze on widely scattered forage, but anthropogenic food sources may cause spatial revisitation and aggregation, posing a risk for transmission of infectious diseases. In 2016, chronic wasting disease (CWD) was first detected in Norway. A legal regulation to ban supplemental feeding of cervids and to fence stored hay bales was implemented to lower aggregation of cervids. Knowledge of further patterns and causes of spatial revisitation can inform disease management. We used a recently developed revisitation analysis on GPS-positions from 13 red deer (Cervus elaphus) to identify the pattern of spatial clustering, and we visited 185 spatial clusters during winter to identify the causes of clustering. Anthropogenic food sources were found in 11.9% of spatial clusters, which represented 31.0% of the clusters in agricultural fields. Dumping of silage and hay bales were the main anthropogenic food sources (apart from agricultural fields), and unfenced hay bales were available despite the regulation. The probability of the clusters being in agricultural fields was high during winter. It may be necessary to find other ways of disposing of silage and enforcing the requirement of fencing around hay bales to ensure compliance, in particular during winters with deep snow.

AB  - In this article, we discuss the pros and cons of transdisciplinary research using the results of a research project on lawns carried out in Sweden from 2013 to 2016. We viewed lawns as a complex ecological and cultural phenomenon and searched for different sustainable lawn solutions in urban areas of Sweden.
   Constraints on the research included the time and effort required for team members to become familiar with the different research approaches, participate in regular meetings and agree on joint methodology. Later in the project, the integration, analysis and understanding of field data, theoretical sources and practical implementation approaches were also time-consuming obstacles. Thus, the initial and final phases of the project were extremely important and demanded a lot of time and effort. Especially challenging was the cross-use of different methodologies from natural and social sciences. Such ambitious multiscale and multitask projects dealing with living urban nature and people require at least five years to complete, rather than the three years typically suggested for classical research projects.
   The pros of the transdisciplinary approach was its ability to incorporate results of natural and social studies into landscape design, the ability to involve stakeholders in different project activities and to disseminate the research results in practice. This research revealed that lawns are a relatively recent phenomenon that is still expanding globally. The social study component showed that mowing and creating smooth, green lawn surfaces is important to stakeholders (lawn users, planners and managers). However, in Sweden, there is a tendency for local citizens to accept more biodiverse plant communities. Working closely with open-minded stakeholders led to the real implementation of lawn alternatives, which, in turn, increased media attention. The initial concept-that management was a central factor to the whole transdisciplinary project-was confirmed. The goal of this article is to share the unique experiences and lessons learned by researchers of conducting transdisciplinary research and to make such complex research more successful.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning (MSP) represent novel approaches intended to transform marine governance and improve ecosystems. The transformation can be supported by sustainability initiatives such as decision-support tools, which inform changes in management strategies and practices. This study illustrates the potential and challenges of such sustainability initiatives to promote deliberative transformative change in marine governance systems. Specifically, it focuses on the amplification processes of the Symphony tool for ecosystem-based MSP in Sweden. Our findings suggest that the amplification of sustainability initiatives is driven by informal networks, coalition forming, resource mobilization skills, a shared vision, trust, experimentation, and social learning. Our results also highlight that in the face of institutional challenges such as sparse financial resources, uncertain institutional support, and divided ownership, a strategic way forward is to simultaneously work on parallel amplification processes, as they may enable each other. Further, we find that a key challenge in amplification across governance scales is the need for significant adjustments of the original innovation, to meet differing needs and competences. This highlights the broader challenge of achieving transformative change across scales in heterogenous and fragmented multilevel governance systems. Co-production of knowledge and early stakeholder interaction to ensure accessibility and availability can improve the chances of successful amplification. To move beyond a mechanistic understanding of steps and processes, future research on sustainability initiatives should consider the interplay between strategic agency, social learning, and institutional context in driving amplification processes.

AB  - This paper compares two rivers, Tana River in Northern Norway and Columbia River on the northwest coast of the United States of America. Both rivers host indigenous populations, the Sami and the Nez Perce, whose cultural and material existence depends upon salmon. Because these people live indigenously within highly industrial, postcolonial societies, their lives have been part of larger economic, political and legal structures for substantial periods of time. In these rivers, peoples have been, and are currently dealing with the possibility of salmon extinction. This article is concerned with how such a crisis has been interpreted and acted upon within two nation's natural-resource management regimes. We observe how the threat of extinction has initiated commotion where nature, economies, legal instruments, politics and science have come into play, in ways that reveal differences in the Norwegian and American constellations of interests and powers, manifested as differences in natural resource management regimes' hierarchies of positions. The outcome is the protection of different entities, which could be labeled cultural and biological sustainability. In the Columbia River, cultural sustainability was promoted while in the Tana, biological sustainability became prioritized. By way of our comparison we ask if the protection of one kind of sustainability has to be to the detriment of the other.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) should maintain populations of focal species, but their ability to achieve this target is affected both by land use outside PAs and by climate warming. To study effects of land use on species and ability of PAs to maintain populations of species, we compared trends in abundance of 15 resident bird species between two periods of relatively stable and increasing logging volume in boreal forests in Finland, in 2006-2011 and 2012-2018, respectively. We studied trends in abundance of forest birds in unprotected areas and in PAs, where logging is not allowed. In general, patterns of population changes did not differ between PAs and unprotected areas. Abundances of ten of the 15 species were, however, concentrated in southern Finland, where PAs have low coverage, and where trends in abundance merely reflect changes in unprotected areas. Five species declined, and they all probably suffered from the effects of increased logging. Four of them had a southern distribution in Finland, so they should even benefit from the rapid climate warming occurring in these regions. In northern Finland, PAs cover a much higher proportion of land than in southern Finland, and thus PA network may better maintain populations, which was also reflected in more stable populations of species therein. For populations to persist in PAs and for PAs to buffer against environmental changes, a PA network should have a high level of coverage as in northernmost Finland thus supporting Aichi Target 11.

AB  - We aim to quantify the changes in regional vegetation cover on the Swiss Plateau during the past two millennia with the recently developed REVEALS model. We used pollen data from four large lakes (>= 520 ha), namely (1) Baldeggersee, Hallwilersee, and Greifensee on the Swiss Plateau and from (2) Zugersee at the Swiss Plateau-Alps transition. Also, we used pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) that are available for 13 taxa in this region. First, we estimated present-day vegetation and land-cover composition on the Swiss Plateau. The REVEALS result is much more similar to the observed composition than the pollen percentages from modern surface sediment samples, thus confirming the robustness of the REVEALS approach for the Swiss Plateau. We then reconstructed regional vegetation composition in 200-year intervals over the past two millennia. In both investigated regions the REVEALS results showed a strong anthropogenic impact on vegetation: the results suggest that the landscape was much more open (20-80%) throughout the past 2000 years than pollen percentages (10-50%) suggest. Our model results provide quantitative and more realistic estimates of the regional vegetation and land-cover changes that are relevant for assessing regional vegetation-climate feedbacks. However, PPEs for more plant taxa as well as further assessment of PPEs, particularly for Cerealia, are needed. Also, the model-inferred quantitative vegetation changes reflect the regional differences in agricultural and other human activities during the Roman Time, the Migration Period, the early and late Middle Ages, and since the onset of Modern Times.

AB  - Forest operations use large amounts of energy, which must be considered when life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied to forest products. Forest management practices differ considerably between countries and may also differ within a country. This paper aims to identify and compare the environmental burdens from forest operations in Sweden and Spain focused on pulpwood production and supply to pulp mills.
   To perform the analysis, the main forest plantations were investigated as well as the most important tree species used in pulp mills in both countries: eucalyptus and, Norway spruce and Scots pine, were taken into account for the Spanish and Swedish case studies, respectively. Energy requirements for pulpwood production and supply to Spanish and Swedish pulp mills are evaluated in this paper. All forest operations from site preparation to extraction of felled wood to the delivery point at the roadside are included within the system boundaries as well as wood transport from forest landing to the pulp mill gate. Seedling and machinery production are excluded from the system boundaries due to lack of field data. The impact assessment phase was carried out according to the Swedish Environmental Management Council and, in particular, the impact categories assessed in forest and agricultural LCAs (global warming, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical oxidant formation) were analysed. SimaPro 7.10 software was used to perform the impact assessment stage.
   Different types of wood are produced in both case studies: softwood in Sweden and hardwood in Spain, with higher production of round wood and biomass per hectare in Sweden. Total energy use for pulpwood production and supply are in a similar order of magnitude, up to 395 MJ and 370 MJ/m(3) solid under bark in Spain and Sweden, respectively. Field operations, such as silviculture and logging, are more energy-intensive in the Spanish case study. However, secondary hauling of pulpwood to pulp mill requires more energy in the Swedish case study. These important differences are related to different forest management practices as well as to pulpwood supply to the pulp mill. The eventual imports of pulpwood, application of pesticides, thinning step or final felling considerably affects energy requirements, which are reflected on the environmental results.
   Although differences between both case studies were observed, several stages were investigated: wood delivery to the pulp mill by road, harvesting and forwarding, contribute considerably to acidification, eutrophication and global warming potential in both cases. The type of wood, the machines used in forest operations (mechanised or motor-manual), the use of fossil fuels and the amount of wood produced influence the results. These differences must be kept in mind in comparative studies between such different countries.
   The results obtained in this work allow one to forecast the importance of forest operations in LCA of forest products (in this case, wood pulp) and the influence of energy use in the results. Special attention has been paid in the inventory analysis stage for both case studies. It is possible to gain a better environmental performance in both case studies if alternative practices are considered, mainly focused on site preparation and stand tending in the Spanish system and on pulpwood supply in the Swedish one.
   This study provides useful information that can assist forest-based industries in the aim of increasing their sustainability. Future work will focus on the study of several transport alternatives of pulpwood supply including railway, road and ship. In addition, pulpwood processing in Spanish and Swedish paper pulp mills considered to be representative of the "state of art" will be carried out in order to get a complete picture of this kind of forest-based industry. In addition, the use of biofuels (such as forest biomass) instead of fossil fuels and CO2 uptake of wood via photosynthesis will be carried out in order to have a complete perspective of forest ecosystems.

AB  - The Asian musk shrew Suncus murinus is an invasive predator that has had a considerable impact on biodiversity. An eradication was attempted from Ile aux Aigrettes, a 25-ha island reserve off the coast of Mauritius as part of a wider restoration program. A total of 759 shrews were removed using up to 1112 live-traps, in six trapping sweeps of the island. After the first four sweeps, in which 705 shrews were caught, complete eradication appeared to have been achieved, with only four shrews caught in the next three months. However, thereafter shrew captures increased and after six months shrews were again being captured in large numbers. We examine three hypotheses for the failure of the eradication program: (i) low efficiency of all traps ('low efficiency' hypothesis); (ii) low trap efficiency in certain locations ('refuge' hypothesis); and (iii) presence of trap-shy individuals ('trap-shy' hypothesis). We constructed an individual-based simulation of the first four trapping sweeps to predict expected patterns of shrew capture for different shrew densities and capture probabilities and in the presence of trapping 'refugia'. The observed patterns of capture were not consistent with the expected patterns of capture under the 'low efficiency' and 'refuge' hypotheses, but were intuitively consistent with the 'trap-shy' hypothesis. We use the results from this study to help plan future eradication programs for S. murinus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Last decade's advances in biotechnology, with the introduction of CRISPR, have challenged the regulatory framework for competent authorities all over the world. Hence, regulatory issues related to gene editing are currently high on the agenda both in the EU and in the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement country of Norway, particularly with regards to sustainable agriculture. During the negotiations on the EEA Agreement, Norway was allowed to retain three extra aims in the Gene Technology Act: "That the production and use of GMO happens in an ethical way, is beneficial to society and is in accordance with the principle of sustainable development ". We argue the case that taking sustainability into the decisions on regulating gene edited products could be easier in Norway than in the EU because of these extra aims. Late blight is our chosen example, as a devastating disease in potato that is controlled in Norway primarily by high levels of fungicide use. Also, many of these fungicides are being banned due to negative environmental and health effects. The costs of controlling late blight in Norway were calculated in 2006, and since then there have been new cultivars developed, inflation and an outbreak of war in Europe increasing farm input costs. A genetically modified (GM) cisgenic late blight resistant (LBR) potato presents a possible solution that could reduce fungicide use, but this could still be controversial. This paper aims to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of approving the commercial use of a GM LBR potato cultivar in Norway and compare these against currently used late blight management methods and conventional potato resistance breeding. We argue that a possible route for future regulatory framework could build upon the proposal by the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board from 2019, also taking sustainability goals into account. This could favour a positive response from the Competent Authorities without breeching the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement. Perhaps the EU could adopt a similar approach to fulfil their obligations towards a more sustainable agriculture?

AB  - Genetic diversity is expected to decrease in small and isolated populations as a consequence of founder effects, bottlenecks, inbreeding and genetic drift. In this study we analyse temporal and spatial effects on genetic variation and progeny viability of the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) at two scales. First, the Swedish distribution has been isolated from the continental distribution for more than 8000 thousand years, and secondly, within Sweden, recent habitat alterations that have taken place during this century have increased isolation between local populations. Genetic variation and progeny survival in relation to isolation was studied within the entire Swedish distribution of the tree frog. Allozyme electrophoresis analysis of froglets, sampled across the Swedish distribution, revealed a low overall genetic variation (1.06 alleles/locus) at the protein level in comparison with continental populations (1.54-1.68 alleles/locus). However, egg hatchability (97 %) and early larval survival (95 %) were not lower than in other parts of the tree frog distribution or in other anuran species. Within the Swedish distribution, early larval survival was lower in isolated breeding ponds than in more central ones. However, no differences in genetic variation were found in relation to isolation. Polymorphism was detected only at a single locus, and was restricted geographically to the eastern part of the Swedish distribution. Bottlenecks due to climatic changes and fragmentation of suitable habitat (primarily natural pastures with ponds) are suggested as possible causes of the low genetic diversity of the Swedish tree frog population.

AB  - Inputs of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) to the environment have led to accumulation of Hg in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, contributing to fish Hg concentrations well above the European Union standards in large parts of Fennoscandia. Forestry operations have been reported to increase the concentrations and loads of Hg to surface waters by mobilizing Hg from the soil. This summary of available forestry effect studies reveals considerable variation in treatment effects on total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) at different sites, varying from no effect up to manifold concentration increases, especially for the bioavailable MeHg fraction. Since Hg biomagnification depends on trophic structures, forestry impacts on nutrient flows will also influence the Hg in fish. From this, we conclude that recommendations for best management practices in Swedish forestry operations are appropriate from the perspective of mercury contamination. However, the complexity of defining effective policies needs to be recognized.

AB  - Replacement of native deciduous forests by coniferous stands was a common consequence of former European afforestation policies. However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (Si) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47% from Si to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from Si to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor "conversion phase". We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.

AB  - In 2011, an amendment was introduced to the Swedish constitution to provide stronger protection for local self-government. This article seeks to explain this amendment in the light of the development of central-local relations towards multi-level governance (MLG). It explores the adaptation hypothesis, i.e. the developments in MLG are followed by an adjustment in constitutional policy that is influenced by subnational actors, through an empirical study of the most prominent Swedish subnational actor - the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). The research showed that SALAR developed an agenda for the regulation of central-local relations in the constitution. SALAR was able to exert influence with this agenda by participating in the policy-making process prior to the amendment of the constitution. The research findings underscore that even though MLG per se has little to do with constitutional policy, it has consequences for such policy due to the role played by subnational actors.

AB  - The removal of logging residues and stumps from clear-cuts has become a common forestry practice. Forest fuel harvesting decreases the initially low volume of dead wood in managed forests, but the biodiversity effects are poorly known. We studied the effects of forest fuel harvesting on decomposer fungi on clear-cut Norway spruce stands in central Finland. The number of occurrences and taxa of polypores, saprotrophic agarics and pleurotoid agarics were determined on 10 forest fuel harvested and 10 control clear-cuts 4-5 years after logging. In total, we recorded 148 fungal taxa. The total number of taxa, the number of polypore occurrences, and the number of polypore species within small area were lower at forest fuel harvested sites. The effect on the number of saprotrophic agaric taxa became obvious with increasing area. Most of the common polypore species had fewer occurrences on forest fuel harvested sites while the commonest agaric species increased due to forest fuel harvesting. Concerning different dead wood types, there were fewer fungal species and occurrences on stumps and fewer occurrences on logs on forest fuel harvested sites. Most of the effects of forest fuel harvesting were explained by the reduction in resource availability. We conclude that forest fuel harvesting, especially stump removal, has negative effects on decomposer fungi and that there is a risk that populations of certain species still thriving in managed forests will decline in the future.

AB  - Avoiding genetic interactions between wild and farmed Atlantic salmon is regarded as one of the major requirements for a sustainable salmon aquaculture industry. For this reason, farming functional sterile triploids has been suggested as a possible solution. However, knowledge about how triploids cope under commercial conditions is lacking. In the present study, we compared the performance of diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon among four Norwegian aquaculture companies. Diploid and triploid groups of the same genetic line were farmed in western, mid, and northern Norway under commercial conditions from seawater transfer until slaughter.Overall, triploid salmon exhibited reduced survival, higher incidence of emaciated fish, and scored, on average, a lower quality rating during primary processing. The results highlight the need for further research on how to improve the welfare and performance of triploid salmon in commercial aquaculture operations.

AB  - Current forestry policies worldwide aim at conserving and restoring biodiversity in managed forests. In this respect, epiphytic lichens have become a focal group in studies of how logging and silvicultural methods can be adjusted to mimic and restore old-growth conditions. We addressed this issue in a retrospective study in the coastal spruce (Picea abies) forest region of central Norway, surveying 31 old forest sites in order to relate a selected group of epiphytic macrolichens (Fuscopannaria ahlneri, Lobaria pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, Nephroma spp., Platismatia norvegica, Pseudocyphellaria crocata, Ramalina thrausta, and Sphaerophorus globosus) to forest stand characteristics and previous logging history. The lichens were associated with brook ravines, F. ahlneri and P. crocata mostly so, being 10 times more abundant in ravine valley bottoms than on adjacent slopes and plateaus. All species used spruce trees as their main substrate, but L. pulmonaria, L. scrobiculata, and Nephroma spp. preferred scattered deciduous trees. Ramalina thrausta and S. globosus occurred more frequently on older trees and increased in number with increasing stand age. In ravine valley bottoms lichens tended to increase in number with increasing tree density (due to increased amount of branches), whereas the opposite was the case on slopes and plateaus (due to higher proportion of high-branched trees). All locations had been selectively cut two or more times during the last 100 yr, with a total harvested volume of 31-124% of present-day standing volumes. After controlling for covariation with stand structure, variables describing logging history (harvested volume, number of cuts, minimum standing volume, and years since last cut) did not explain significant parts of the variation in present-day abundance of the selected lichens. The results suggest that moderate selective cuttings may prove an acceptable management option to sustain viable lichen assemblages on private land.

AB  - Metals occur naturally in soil, but contents are generally increased in the urban environment due to anthropogenic activities. The presence of elevated metals in soils of the urban environment has been recognized as an important source of metal intake in children and is linked to elevated metal levels in children's blood. Several metals have undesirable health effects, especially on children due to their still developing nervous system and small body volumes. Playgrounds are where urban children spend most of their time outdoors and are also where children most frequently come in contact with soil. Elevated contents of metals in playgrounds are therefore of great concern for children's wellbeing. This study investigates the soil metal content of 25 playgrounds located in different land use areas in urban Uppsala, Sweden's fourth largest city. Uppsala covers an area of approximately 100 km(2) and has a population of 136,000. The soil samples were analysed for 12 metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, W, Zn) using aqua regia. Median metal contents were found to be 1.8, 3.4, 0.21, 32, 25, 2.5, 0.14, 494, 19, 26, 0.35 and 84 mg kg(-1) soil for each of the above metals, respectively. The median clay content was around 20% while the organic matter content was measured by loss on ignition at a median of 8%. The land use areas included industrial land, the city center, road verges, natural land and former industrial land. The results showed that land use did not have the expected large influence on the total metal contents of the soils tested. The clay content together with the age of the site proved to be a more important factor. Sites with elevated clay contents had in general elevated metal contents, which were explained by the relatively high adsorption capacity of clay particles. The soils at sites where land use had not been altered since the 1800s had increased metal contents compared to playgrounds constructed in the late 1900s. The immobility of metals once they had entered the soil system was the reason for increased metal content in soils of old playgrounds. It was concluded that in cities with few internal pollution sources, the soil characteristics of the site and the time the soil has been on-site to accumulate metal residues become important factors in determining the soil metal content.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has significantly impacted habitat structures in agricultural landscapes and is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline, especially in farmland birds. Birds are considered to reflect well the trends in other biodiversity elements and are therefore often used as indicator species. We studied common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) brood habitat use in a small-grain-dominated farmland in southern Finland. The broods significantly preferred field margins compared to their availability. The importance of field margins was underlined, as 68% of pheasant brood observations in grain fields were within a 25-m-wide zone from the field edge, despite the availability being only 40% of the field area. Our results support the idea that field margins and their proximity act as possible biodiversity reservoirs even in intensive farming systems. Increasing the amount of field margins can be an effective management method when aiming to improve success of common pheasant broods while simultaneously benefitting farmland biodiversity. Identifying key habitats and landscape features that allow the co-existence of biodiversity and effective food production is crucial when aiming to halt the ongoing biodiversity collapse.

AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide, but lack of long-term regional data makes identifying possible causes difficult, hindering conservation efforts. We evaluated whether habitat destruction, terrestrial habitat adjacent to ponds and the physico-chemical characteristics of ponds could explain the regional and local decline of the spadefoot toad (Pelobates fuscus) in Sweden.
   Analyses of aerial photos and field observations revealed that out of all of the known calling sites of the species since 1959, 26% did not exist in 2000. The road traffic intensity adjacent to existing ponds indicated that in 1997-2003 it was higher near ponds where calling males had disappeared (N = 240) compared to sites where calling males were present (N = 84). The soil-type adjacent to ponds with calling males was more sandy than at ponds where calling males had disappeared (instead dominated by till). By including road traffic intensity and proportion of sandy soils adjacent to ponds, a logistic regression model correctly classified 82% of the ponds into their correct category.
   Of 36 ponds investigated in 2004, we found evidence of successful reproduction (tadpoles) in 53%. Unsuccessful reproduction seemed to be associated with eutrophication and low coverage of submerged macrophytes. In an area with low road traffic intensity and sandy soils, restoration of ponds started in 1996, and the number of calling males increased from a maximum of 77 in 1993-1996 to 146 in 2006. Our results indicate that habitat destruction has likely contributed to the regional decline of P. fuscus, but also that local factors such as soil type, traffic intensity and reproductive failure may also help explain the decline of the species.

AB  - The development of affinities between the production and consumption of people and place is crucial for tourism development. We trouble front and backstage distinctions to examine how destinations are framed and critically explore the power of the imaginary in shaping how individuals apprehend and in turn create social worlds. Combining critical discourse analysis with stakeholder interviews, we scrutinise an influential television travel documentary as an instrument of cultural pedagogy, which recycles, recreates and re-enacts the tourism imaginary. The paper's distinctive contribution is to show the multiple means through which travel journalism enrols tourists through imagined portrayals of people and place within globalised cultural texts by highlighting the multi-dimensional workings of power in and through a framing of Northern Norway.

AB  - Changes in agricultural policies have caused dramatic changes in land-use in agricultural landscapes. To investigate whether such changes in land-use relate to temporal changes in bird communities a repeated inventory (1994 and 2004) of farmland birds was made in 212 point-count sites in south-central Sweden.
   Distinct changes in abundance of several species over the study period were recorded, abundance of the 16 studied species decreased by 23%. The decline was significant for eight species, while two species increased significantly. Persistence and colonisation models suggested similar species-habitat relationships as the snapshot models, i.e. eight of the 12 associations were in line with what could be expected from the snapshot models. Occurrence of nine species was linked to land-use whereas six species displayed links between changes in occurrence and changes in land-use. In line with previous studies positive effects of short rotation coppice and negative effects of autumn-sown crops were found, while set-asides showed fewer effects than expected. In the snapshot models several species showed links to landscape characteristics such as amount of forest (negative for five species) and landscape heterogeneity (positive for six species). The evidence for effects of the landscape variables on persistence/colonisation was more restricted.
   The results suggest that both land-use changes and the landscape setting may cause local changes in abundance of farmland birds, even for species displaying a general decline in numbers between years, the effects of land-use changes being, however, strongly species specific.

AB  - The majority of C, N and P in boreal lakes are in organic form. Organically bound nutrients are released through biodegradation or photodegradation which affects the water quality, eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions of lakes. We tested whether open land-use data combined with land-use-specific export coefficients can be used to predict total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) loading and lake water concentrations. Using data from 12 lake catchments in eastern Finland, we found that land use and management of the catchment explained a substantial proportion of the variations in TOC (r (2) = 0.78), DON (r (2) = 0.55) and DOP (r (2) = 0.80) concentrations between lakes. The computation does not account for in-lake processes, which are reflected as mismatch between the predicted and observed concentrations. However, this simple practical approach is useful in ranking lakes according to their water quality. The results indicated that natural sources dominate TOC, DON and DOP exports; the background leachings accounted for 57-99 %, 48-96 % and 55-99 % of TOC, DON and DOP export, respectively. The proposed method has promise as a practical decision support tool for assessing the impacts of land use on water quality. The results showed that possibilities to control TOC, DON and DOP loading to surface waters are limited to catchments where the peatland proportion is low and anthropogenic sources significant.

AB  - A pollen record from a small alder carr located in the centre of a Fagus stand near the hamlet of Flahult in southern Smaland has shown that Fagus became established in a semi-open cultural landscape about 900 B.P. Human disturbance seems to have controlled the local establishment of Fagus at this site through an expansion of pastoral farming. The Fagus dominance in the present stand seems to be of recent origin, as Fagus pollen percentages and influx values have increased considerably only during the last 50 years. The modern composition and structure of the Fagus stand are probably an effect of changes in land-use and decreased human activity at the end of the last century. Today, only occasional Picea individuals occur in the studied stand, and Picea does not appear to have been more abundant in the recent past. The regional expansion of Picea has probably occurred during this century and has been favoured by modern forestry during the last 50 years.

AB  - Stocking is undertaken in the River Suldalslagen, western Norway, to compensate for an estimated annual loss of 20 000 Atlantic salmon smolts, Salmo salar L., caused by regulating the river for hydropower production. The annual contribution to angling catches from stocked hatchery fish varied from 7 to 334 kg, or < 15% of the total number caught. Between 160 000 and 250 000 one-summer old fish were stocked, but only between 6 and 10 (< 0.005%) were recaptured as adults in the river. Recaptured stocked fish never exceeded 0.03% by number, despite smolts dominating the stocking material in recent years. It is not certain whether the slight increase in catches comes in addition to or at the expense of natural reproduction. In most years more adults were used as parent stock than were caught as offspring. The lack of positive response to stocking is possibly due to lesser age, smaller size and later migration of hatchery smolts, and that seawater tolerance of hatchery smolts is poorly developed, all factors increasing mortality at sea.

This article focuses on the side of the commissioner- Estonian liberal municipal politicians who gained power in Tallinn City Council and became the main driving force in developing modern planning. Among other important actors, the organization of house- owners and some individuals emerged. Actors were highly motivated in implementing international urban planning for they connected the modern planning with ideas of developing Tallinn into modern European city and national capital. The international planning competition was organized in a possible high professional level and it resulted with the project "Greater-Tallinn" by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen in 1913.

AB  - Prediction of the effect of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is necessary both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes.
   We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007-2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We applied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A1B scenario.
   We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso07 for mineral soils. For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors.
   The stock change of trees accounted for approximately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and mineral soils acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13-20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2.6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %-58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of mineral soils in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils.
   It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, mineral soils, and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests.

AB  - 1. Forest ecosystems have been subjected to intensive exploitation, and on top of these land use-driven habitat alterations, there is an ongoing and rapid climate change. Understanding why environmental responses differ across species and how differences are mediated by species' traits is crucial for predicting the complex effects of global change on forest biodiversity.
   2. We used (1) single-species distribution models and (2) multispecies predictive fourth-corner models of varying complexity to identify critical response traits of dead wood inhabiting bryophytes and to quantify species' relationships with climatic and forest landscape variation. We hypothesized that reproductive and life-history traits would be mainly linked with forest connectivity, whereas morphological traits would mostly relate to (micro-) climatic variation.
   3. The inferred trait-environment relationships based on the different fourth-corner models were consistent. Unexpectedly, reproduction modes were more closely linked to climatic and habitat factors than to forest connectivity. Sexual reproduction was positively related to high temperatures and broadleaf trees, but negatively to high amounts of precipitation. The opposite was true for species which predominantly, or additionally, reproduce asexually. Bryophyte life-forms were related to both habitat and climatic conditions. The positive relationship of shoot length with both high temperatures and high amounts of precipitation suggested that competitive exclusion is important in determining trailing edges of dead wood inhabiting bryophytes.
   4. Synthesis. Differences in physiological tolerances obviously play a much greater role in shaping the distributional pattern of bryophyte species with different reproductive systems than previously thought. Evidence suggests that current geographic ranges were primarily determined by physiological tolerances and competitive abilities. Species' relationships with forest connectivity were complex and determined by the combination of reproductive traits with other critical species' properties. Given the different species' relationships with climatic gradients, and the varying species' dispersal and competitive capacities, we expect clear changes in metacommunity composition following climate change and an overall decrease in the diversity of dead wood inhabiting bryophytes in Sweden.

AB  - To strengthen public participation in planning and to aid the public in understanding the proposed plans, planners use different types of illustrations to show the outcome of a project. Effective presentation of the projects' impacts on the public has become increasingly essential in planning and designing transport systems. However, a central premise for conscious decision-making is that the information of the project must be realistically presented so that the plans are accurate in relation to the estimated effects. Drawing from theories on visualisation in plans and science and technology studies (STS), the paper aims to discuss and raise awareness of visual representation in urban transport planning. Using data from large road infrastructure projects in Norway, visual illustrations found in planning documents are analysed in relation to written texts on traffic effects and the overall project goal. By focusing on the visual illustrations, it is shown that artefacts related to the green environment and transport modes of cycles, buses and walking are overrepresented in the documents. The visualisation support the idea of a sustainable transport system and a sustainable mobility planning approach. Most of the projects are road enlargement projects; however, there is a lack of visualisation of car flows, or the flows are very low. Cars are toned down (or even absent) compared with the estimated effects. The documents also show clear patterns of standardisation of artefacts. Nevertheless, there is a heterogeneity in the visual illustrations when combining different documents. The paper introduces the concept 'add-on flexibility' to illustrate this type of contextualisation. It contributes to a new critical perspective on visualisation and its representation in urban transport planning.

AB  - Here we quantitatively summarize the conservation ecology of one group of dead-wood-dependent organisms, the polyporous fungi, in boreal Europe. At the substrate scale, the decay stage is the strongest determinant of species richness, with large (>20 cm diameter) downed logs hosting more species than other dead-wood types. At the stand scale, the amount of dead wood is the strongest determinant of poly-pore species richness; the minimum average amount of dead wood for the occurrence of rare polypores appears to be 20-40 m(3)/ha. Species-area analysis shows that in mature boreal forests species accumulation levels off at around 20-30 ha. This leads us to suggest a heuristic 20/20/20 rule of thumb: a 20 ha stand, with an average of 20 m(3)/ha of dead wood of which many are logs >20 cm, is likely to be the minimum for the ecologically justified conservation of polypore diversity at the stand scale in boreal Europe. Equally crucial for polypore diversity, however, is the current and historic extent of suitable habitats at the landscape scale. The time lag between the isolation of a habitat patch and the new equilibrium in the number or occurrence of species seems to be around 100-150 years, indicating that an extinction debt is likely to exist in recently isolated fragments. Only a few studies have addressed the ecological efficiency of the new, biodiversity-oriented forest management tools (retention trees, woodland key habitats). Despite this it seems that the traditional large conservation areas are the most effective means of polypore conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past few decades a wide range of structural and compositional indicators has been developed for the assessment of forest natural status. In many cases the indicators have been chosen on empirical bases without testing their predictive power. This study describes a number of structural and compositional parameters in Vaccinium vitis-idaea pine forest over a wide range of stand age and management intensity values. A robust index was developed to describe management intensity: area-weighted sum of anthropogenic activities, based on the forest management database. After the removal of forest age effect, forest management intensity had a negative influence on spruce abundance, number of diameter classes, basal area and number of decay classes of dead wood. Stepwise logistic regression analysis produced the optimal set of indicators for the evaluation of dry boreal forest naturalness: basal area of lying dead wood, structural variation of the tree layer, herb-layer species composition and presence/absence of woodpeckers.

AB  - Floods are among the most damaging of natural disasters, and flood events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency with the effects of climate change and changes in land use. As a consequence, much focus has been placed on the engineering of structural flood mitigation measures in rivers. Traditional flood protection measures, such as levees and dredging of the river channel, threaten floodplains and river ecosystems, but during the last decade, sustainable reconciliation of freshwater ecosystems has increased. However, we still find many areas where these traditional measures are proposed, and it is challenging to find tools for evaluation of different measures and quantification of the possible impacts. In this paper, we focus on the river L AE rdal in Norway to (i) present the dilemma between traditional flood measures and maintaining river ecosystems and (ii) quantify the efficiency and impact of different solutions based on 2D hydraulic models, remote sensing data, economics, and landscape metrics. Our results show that flood measures may be in serious conflict with environmental protection and legislation to preserve biodiversity and key nature types.

AB  - Special attention has been paid to sustainable macroalgae cultivation in Europe. The question on where suitable cultivation areas lie, without conflicting with current marine socio-economic activities and respecting the environment, remains a great challenge. Considering 13 criteria critical to seaweed farming such as depth, shipping traffic, and distance to ports, this paper aimed to identify suitable and sustainable offshore areas on the West Coast of Sweden for the cultivation of the Sugar Kelp, Saccharina latissima. An integrated approach with the tools geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was used to aggregate the criteria by means of Boolean and weighted linear combination (WLC) techniques. The Boolean method singled out 544 km(2) as suitable, whereas the WLC method indicated 475 km(2) as highly suitable. Both techniques complement each other in finding optimal sites. Furthermore, the integrated models excelled in providing an overview for effective spatial decision-making that fosters sustainable development of macroalgae cultivations within marine and coastal systems.

TI  - The evolving forest regime and domestic actors: Strategic or normative adaptation?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA  - English
AB  - How have forest-related international environmental agreements (IEAs) affected domestic policy and forest owners in industrialised, forest-rich countries? This question is investigated by identifying and explaining the effects of IEAs on Norwegian forest policy and forestry. The analysis shows that international commitments and recommendations have had little effect on domestic forest policy. While environmental certification of forest owners by private initiative is in compliance with international recommendations and European criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management, competitiveness concerns and pressures from environmental organisations and the marketplace have been more important for this initiative than IEAs. Although environmental certification can be explained as strategic adaptation to market demands, this mechanism is dependent upon actors valuing and having internalised certain norms and principles. It is argued that IEAs have contributed to establish, strengthen and disseminate norms and principles regarding conservation of old-growth forests and biodiversity. The interplay between rational calculative and cognitive processes is thus important for understanding domestic adaptations to forest-related agreements.

AB  - Nitrate (NO3-N) in soil solution and streamwater can be an important vector of nitrogen (N) loss from forested watersheds, and nitrification is associated with negative consequences of soil acidification and eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to identify vegetation-mediated soil properties that may control potential net nitrification dynamics and to determine if net nitrification is a function of abiotic retention or biotic inhibition. We performed a soil inoculation and incubation study and analyzed a suite of soil chemical and biological properties in soils from a 40-year-old Appalachian hardwood forest and an adjacent 37-year-old Norway spruce forest converted from Appalachian hardwoods. Our results indicate that net NO3-N production was nine times higher in hardwood soil (mean = 183.51 mg N/kg/28 days) than in the spruce soil (mean = 18.97 mg N/kg/28 days) and differences in net NO3-N production were attributed to differences in soil substrate quality. Soil properties that were most strongly correlated with NO3-N production across vegetation types included total soil N, soil C:N ratio, oxalate concentration, and sulfate concentration. Establishment of a spruce monoculture in the central Appalachian hardwood ecoregion significantly altered N cycling, likely depleted soil N stores, increased soil acidity, and altered soil organic matter dynamics, thus leading to low net nitrification rates.

AB  - This paper takes a critical look at biopolitical practices under the current regime for wolf conservation in Ger-many. One profound difference between human and more-than-human biopolitics is that it concerns multiple, more-than-human bodies, demanding a close examination of governance practices aimed at enabling conser-vation. My core argument is twofold: first, I argue that conservation policies in Germany attempt to frame wolves as collectivities and apply a population perspective on these animals. However, the very technologies that aim to monitor wolves as population, namely genetic analyses, also produce individual wolves that complicate con-servation efforts due to their affective force (Lorimer, 2015). Second, as active wolf management in the form of population control is rare due to legal regulations, there is a strong focus on livestock protection measures. These infrastructuring practices (Barua, 2021) continue to fail because they rest on the idea that convivial coexistence can be quantified and ignore that technologies such as fences can alter animals' atmospheres (Lorimer et al., 2019) profoundly. As a result, infrastructuring practices aimed at enabling coexistence may run counter to their initial purpose. With fences becoming habitats, lively and discursive multispecies relations are renegotiated.

AB  - Continuous cover forestry (CCF) has been promoted as an environmentally sustainable option for drained peatlands. The CCF management has been challenged due to potentially lower tree growth compared to tradi-tional even-aged management, especially with suppressed trees that are released during a selection harvesting under CCF management. Our objective was to quantify the time lag of stem diameter growth response of suppressed Norway spruce trees (Picea abies Karst.) after a selection harvesting compared to that of dominant trees. We also tested if the carbon assimilation of the trees increased immediately after selection harvesting. We used radial increment cores from suppressed Norway spruce trees to estimate the impact of selection harvesting on the diameter growth and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). We measured carbon isotope composition (delta 13C) of wood, to quantify how the reduced competition between trees altered iWUE and its components, the photosynthetic rate (A) and sto-matal conductance (g). The study was conducted in the Lettosuo experimental site on fertile forestry drained peatland area in southern Finland. Approximately 70 % of the initial stand area (18.5 ha) was harvested according to CCF principles by applying selection harvesting, and the rest of the area was divided to intact control area and to clear-cut area. In the study site, by selection harvest, trees were removed from multiple age classes, but especially mature trees individually or in a small groups were taken away to maintain uneven-aged structure of the forest. All the target trees grew in the similar competitive position before selection harvesting. Our results show that there was a delay with the diameter growth of the suppressed trees to selection har-vesting, whereas the most significant growth-enhancing effect occurred three-four years after selection har-vesting. In contrast to the delay in the increment, the photosynthetic rate relative to stomatal conductance increased immediately after selection harvesting, as shown by the instant 2.5 parts per thousand increase in delta 13C to a post-harvest level. Our results show that carbon uptake increased immediately for suppressed Norway spruce trees after selection harvesting, but the harvest did not induce a clear increase in stem diameter growth during the first years after the harvest.

AB  - Palaeoecological methods were used to study forest dynamics at stand and landscape scales in the Pechoro-Ilych Zapovednik in the Komi Republic in Russia. A survey of charcoal bands in peat deposits at 36 sites on a 160 km(2) area showed that the greater part of the landscape has burnt regularly. Here the landscape is dominated by Scots pine on dry soil. There are, however, Nor-way spruce sites, with a high permanent water table and with tall herb vegetation without traces of fire.
   Stand-scale, hi.-h-resolution pollen studies at one pine and one spruce site were consistent with the landscape results. Charcoal bands and fire-driven succession were observed at the pine site, whilst the spruce site had no evidence of fire during at least the last 2600 years.
   This study shows that the main part of this natural landscape has been regularly affected by fire, but also that there are networks of stands at a landscape scale that form stable fire-free refuge with a continuous forest cover. The presence of such a strong contrast in disturbance regimes within one landscape has important implications for the management of biological diversity in forestry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Future climate projections are usually only available at global or coarse scale and the focus is often on long-term global or regional averages. Though useful to analyse general trends and identify potential risks and opportunities internationally, these resolutions are unable to capture the complexity of coastal areas where aquaculture is located, and poorly represent the environmental variabilities to which cultured organisms are subjected. Consequently, most aquaculture planning and management decisions require information at a much finer scale. If climate projections do not adequately represent conditions experienced at aquaculture sites, potential impacts could be missed, adaptation strategies may be inappropriate, and time and resources could be spent implementing ineffective measures. To demonstrate this, we focus on sea temperature and the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Norway, the world's leading salmon producer and a country with a latitudinal range that exemplifies the challenges related to generalization of farming practises. The results show that if coarse resolution climate model temperatures were used directly, then impacts on salmon culture could be severely over or underestimated. For overlapping reference periods, the average daily modelled temperatures at selected sites frequently differed by several degrees, with the largest differences being over 6 degrees C, when compared to daily average farm measurements. This has serious biological and economic implications as potential risks to production could be underestimated unless corrected. Here two bias-correction techniques were used to calibrate the climate projections to farm scale and shown to more accurately reflect the conditions experienced. The calibrated future projections for RCP4.5 suggest increased temperatures at all sites may require adjustments to existing farm management practices, but the nature and severity of the impact will vary with location. Our research clearly shows that local scale conditions must be considered, using locally resolved climate projections, to develop meaningful adaptation plans to meet the growing demand for seafood in a changing climate.

AB  - In an analysis of food system sustainability challenges and solutions among Swedish food system actors using Q -methodology, five perspectives were identified. One of the main three perspectives placed the highest priority on reduced meat consumption, food waste, and climate impact in agriculture, but downplayed strategies highlighted in the national food strategy and social aspects, and can be interpreted as a diagnostic climate mitigation-oriented perspective that does not reflect current negotiated policy processes or 'softer' values of food. In an alternative regenerative perspective, industrialized large-scale farming and lack of internalization of external costs were regarded as the main problems, and diversity, soil health, and organic farming as the main solutions. Proponents of a third perspective regarded phasing out fossil fuels, increased profitability of companies, increased meat production, and self-sufficiency as high priorities. These contrasting views can be a major barrier to transforming the Swedish food system. However, a number of entry points for change (i.e. aspects highly important for some and neutral for others) were identified, including focusing on healthy diets and increased production of fruit and vegetables. Focusing on these can build trust among stakeholders before moving to discussions about the larger and more sensitive systemic changes needed.

AB  - The combination of features from the public and private sectors in jointly owned companies imposes challenges to the governance and control mechanisms of these organisations, which have been criticised for lacking accountability. Where there is fragmented ownership, the interests of different owners need to be coordinated. The aim of this article is to consider how such companies can be governed in order to avoid this lack of accountability. The focus is on Swedish and Italian experience with joint public-private water supply companies in the local government area. The analysis draws on the literature on corporate governance in the public sector and shows that, even though contextual differences exist between the Swedish and Italian cases, there are also similarities in regard to the need to manage the conflicts of interests that surface due to fragmented ownership.

AB  - Contextual relativities in the diversifying expression of New Urbanism are increasingly important. In this article, we explore the significance of context using a Scandinavian setting as example. We examine two embodiments of the Swedish realisation of New Urban neighbourhoods. Important in our exploration are the relationalities with contemporary contexts and belief systems, since every effort to create space becomes "an elaboration of the beliefs and values of some collection of people, expressed and fostered in their promotion of a preferred reality" (Stokowski, 2002, p. 374). The findings from the study demonstrate that the Swedish New Urban neighbourhood-no matter how meaningful as a communicative form mediating between agents and structures-cannot effect social cohesion or isolation. Rather, form communicates or evokes meaning in a variety of complex ways, suggesting the importance of "look[ing] to multiply.our readings of the city" (Leach, 1997, p. 158), particularly high-level readings that echo notions of the common good. Those concerned with New Urbanism's embodiments should deliberate on relational fluidities and thereby strike a balance between conceptualising such urban design as either deterministically exceeding its power (Lawhon, 2009) or as side-lined to the whimsical relativity of particular consumers (Latham, 2003; Smith, 2002).

AB  - Wooden multi-storey construction (WMC) offers an alternative building solution for urban consumers seeking a low-carbon, sustainable lifestyle yet, the literature on consumer experiences in newly constructed WMC-apartments is sparse. This exploratory study develops an understanding about consumer choices with newly built WMC-apartments through thematic interviews of residents and property managers in five cities across Finland and Sweden.Contents analysis reveals that neither building material nor sustainability triggered the residents' initial interest in the new apartment. Residents found WMC appealing but traditional housing choice criteria (e.g. location, floor plan and affordability) guided the ultimate purchasing decision. Notwithstanding, residents expressed that the newly developed neighbourhoods suffered from limited services but trusted that future long-term development would increase service availability.Wood material was experienced as mainly positive and was assessed together with overall aesthetics, sustainability and durability aspects of the building. Residents trusted that the builders considered the apartment's sustainability criteria during construction (e.g. material durability and resistance to changing climate conditions).

AB  - Harvesting large carnivores is often a controversial issue and thus requires a higher precision than other types of recreational harvest. Despite this, management programmes are often initiated based on very limited knowledge about the state of the population and the composition and magnitude of the harvest. Here we analyse patterns of lynx harvest in Norway based on harvest data from 1994 to 2009. We found clear signs of sex-biased harvest rates, with males generally being more at risk. Further, harvest mortality rates increased with age among males but not among females. In general, the degree of quota filling was high, but there was a tendency for decreasing quota filling with increasing quotas. A population reconstruction of the Norwegian lynx population (1994-2004) based on a modified cohort analysis closely tracked the development in the official monitoring data, suggesting that the managers have access to relatively good information about the development of the population, at least at a larger spatial scale. Despite this, the population trajectory showed large temporal variation, and time lags in the management's decision-making process are a likely cause of the observed patterns in the Norwegian lynx population.

AB  - Diversification of agriculture was one of the strengthened aims of the greening payment of European Agricultural Policy (CAP) as diversification provides numerous ecosystems services compared to cereal-intensive crop rotations. This study focuses on current minor crops in Finland that have potential for expanded production and considers changes in their cropping areas, yield trends, breeding gains, roles in crop rotations and potential for improving resilience. Long-term datasets of Natural Resources Institute Finland and farmers' land use data from the Agency of Rural Affairs were used to analyze the above-mentioned trends and changes. The role of minor crops in rotations declined when early and late CAP periods were compared and that of cereal monocultures strengthened. Genetic yield potentials of minor crops have increased as also genetic improvements in quality traits, although some typical trade-offs with improved yields have also appeared. However, the gap between potential and attained yields has expanded, depending on the minor crop, as national yield trends have either stagnated or declined. When comparing genetic improvements of minor crops to those of the emerging major crop, spring wheat, breeding achievements in minor crops were lower. It was evident that the current agricultural policies in the prevailing market and the price environment have not encouraged cultivation of minor crops but further strengthened the role of cereal monocultures. We suggest optimization of agricultural land use, which is a core element of sustainable intensification, as a future means to couple longterm environmental sustainability with better success in economic profitability and social acceptability. This calls for development of effective policy instruments to support farmer's diversification actions.

AB  - Habitat restoration is often implemented to mitigate the negative effects of intensive forestry on biodiversity. It may be increasingly adopted in future to alleviate additional negative effects of climate change. Ascertaining the restoration effort needed to fulfill project goals is difficult. Insights may be gained through simulating the effects of restoration efforts on landscape dynamics through time. Here we used a spatially explicit landscape simulation model to simulate the effects of different restoration efforts on forest landscapes in Sweden to assess the level of mitigation that is needed to allow viable populations of the locally critically endangered White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos); an umbrella species whose protection may serve the protection of a range of other species. Based on the goals of the protection plan for the species, which reflect its habitat requirements, we evaluated which of several restoration scenarios could fulfill goals with respect to (1) the amount of deciduous forest; (2) the amount of dead wood; and (3) the age of the forest. We found that whereas it may be relatively easy and quick to acquire high levels of dead wood, increasing the proportions of deciduous forest and of old forests require considerably more time and effort. Also, current management actions would not be sufficient to create the required amount of habitat to conserve the White-backed Woodpecker in our study region. Simulations like ours can provide valuable information about the levels of restoration needed through time to fulfill project goals and may prevent wasting valuable resources, time, effort, and money.

AB  - The cultural landscape development of a farming community in western Norway was investigated through pollen analyses from a lake and a peat/soil profile. The pollen record from the lake indicates that there was a decrease in arboreal pollen (AP) by the end of the Mesolithic period (ca. 4200 cal B.C.), and that a substantial forest clearance occurred during the Bronze Age (ca. 1500 cal B.C.). The latter, together with grazing indicators and cereals, suggests a widespread establishment of farming. At the beginning of the Roman Iron Age there is an increase in heath communities. The pollen diagram from the peat/soil profile shows the forest clearance in the Bronze Age more clearly than the lake profile. This local pollen diagram is compared with modern pollen samples from mown and grazed localities in western Norway. Both analogue matching and ordination (PCA) indicate that the site was characterised by pastures and cereal fields from the Late Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. An expansion of cereal cultivation took place during the Pre-Roman Iron Age, and an arable field was established at the site after ca. A.D. 800. This investigation illustrates the potential of selecting pollen sites reflecting different spatial scales, and complements the cultural history of the area as inferred from archaeological and historical records.

AB  - A continuous time-economic model for optimal thinning androtation is modified to include natural regeneration. The respecified model is capable of describing both optimal forest rotation and continuous cover forestry (uneven-aged management). Continuous cover forestry is shown to be optimal if the preset value of continuous sustainable harvesting income over an infinite horizon is higher than the clearcut revenue and the highest possible value of bare land. Negative bare land value implies optimality of continuous cover forestry but only if clearcut stumpage prices are not higher than thinning stumpage prices. Given low interest rate optimized thinning is shown to increase rotation length. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sweden, a European leader in the consumption of biofuels, has surpassed targets set by the EU and is one of a few countries that has increased consumption of biofuels in recent years. Nonetheless, a large share of biofuels, and raw materials used to produce the fuels, are imported from regions outside Sweden. This paper reviews the environmental implications of consumption of biofuels in Sweden 2000-2014 to identify and provide a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts that imports of fuels have both in Sweden and abroad using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results suggest that while greenhouse gas emissions may have been reduced in Sweden by the use of biofuels, the origin of the emissions has shifted from Sweden to Europe and other countries abroad, due in part to an increased use of biofuels and raw materials from abroad. This has important implications for local impacts, as this may increase acidification and eutrophication potential and ecotoxicity created abroad. Thus, although policy has been designed to promote sustainable transportation fuels, in addition to the generation goals set by the Swedish Parliament, the implications on regions exporting fuels and raw materials for Swedish consumption should be reviewed and followed in further detail in order to avoid problem shifting.

AB  - Mining has changed landscapes locally in northern Fennoscandia and there is an increasing pressure for exploitation of the remaining mineral deposits of the region. Mineral deposits, even if unmined, can strongly influence stream water chemistry, stream biological communities and the ability of organisms to tolerate stressors. Using data sampled from six mining areas with three active (gold and chrome), two closed (gold) and one planned mine (phosphate), we examined how mineral deposits and mining influence water chemistry and diatom and macroinvertebrate communities in subarctic streams in Finnish Lapland. We supplemented the data by additional samples compiled from databases and further assessed how variation in background geological conditions influences bioassessments of the impacts arising from mining. We found that water specific conductivity was elevated in our study streams draining through catchments with a high mineral potential. Mining effects were mainly seen as increased concentration of nitrogen. Influence of mineral deposits was detected in composition of diatom and macroinvertebrate communities, but communities in streams in areas with a high mineral potential were as diverse as those in streams in areas with a low mineral potential. Mining impacts were better detected for diatoms using a reference condition based on sites with a high than low mineral potential, while for macroinvertebrates, the responses were generally less evident, likely because of only minor effects of mining on water chemistry. Community composition and frequencies of occurrence of macroinvertebrate taxa were, however, highly similar between mine-influenced streams and reference streams with a high potential for minerals indicating that the communities are strongly structured by the natural influence of mineral deposits. Incorporating geochemistry into the reference condition would likely improve bioassessments of both taxonomic groups. Replicated monitoring in potentially impacted sites and reference sites would be the most efficient framework for detecting environmental impacts in streams draining through mineral-rich catchments.

AB  - Increasing atheism, or the view that there is no God, is a major trend affecting the Western religious landscape. Scholarly interest in atheists has grown together with their number, but unanswered questions abound. In this study, we present survey data (N = 758) collected from deconverted and lifelong atheists in four countries (Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway), and investigate the relationships between deconversion, religious identity, spiritual identity, and interreligious attitudes. We show that retaining a low level of religious or spiritual identity is more typical for deconverts than life-long atheists. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher religious or spiritual identity among deconverts is associated with more positive attitudes toward different religious groups (national religious majority, religious minorities in general, and Muslims specifically).

KW  - PERCEPTIONS
AB  - There are many unique issues associated with natural resource management in the far north as a result of legislative direction, historic settlement and occupation patterns, northern cultural traditions, ecotourism, economic depression, pressures for energy development, and globalization and modernization effects. Wilderness designation in Canada, the USA, and Finland is aimed at preserving and restoring many human and ecological values, as are the long-established, strictly enforced, nature reserves in Russia. In Alaska and Finland, and in some provinces of Canada, there is a variety of values associated with protecting relatively intact relationships between indigenous people and relatively pristine, vast ecosystems. These values are often described as "traditional means of livelihood," "traditional means of access," "traditional relationships with nature," or "traditional lifestyles." Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) forms part of these relationships and has been acknowledged as a contributor to understanding the effects of management decisions and human-use impacts on long-term ecological composition, structure, and function. Wilderness protection can help maintain opportunities to continue traditional relationships with nature. As cultures continue to evolve in customs, attitudes, knowledge, and technological uses, values associated with both TEK and relationships with relatively pristine ecosystems will also evolve. Understanding these relationships and how to consider them in wilderness protection and restoration decision making is potentially one of the most contentious, widespread natural resource management issues in the circumpolar north.

AB  - Aspen is a keystone species in boreal forests. The future of aspen in many conservation areas is threatened by ungulate browsing. Our aim was to study the effect of browsing on aspen regeneration and population structure in conservation areas in Central Finland, and the effect of surrounding landscape structure on browsing. Aspen density varied greatly among and within conservation areas. In about half of the conservation areas, middle-sized aspens were scarce or missing, which indicates heavy browsing in the recent past. In addition, the number of dead, large aspens in advanced decay stages were rare. Browsing pressure varied greatly among the areas, but on average, a bit more than half of the living aspens had been browsed. Landscape structure influenced browsing so that increasing proportion of farmland within 1 km and 3 km of the conservation areas decreased browsing pressure. The poor recruitment of aspen in many conservation areas jeopardizes the accumulation of large living and dead aspens. This means that many aspen-associated threatened species are in the risk of local extinction, unless aspen recruitment is enhanced by management.

AB  - Background: There has been a strong focus on environmental sustainability in the aquaculture industry, but we do not know how firms in this industry emphasize the issue compared to firms in other industries. Methods: Responding to this research gap, we compared survey data of Norwegian firms in the (1) aquaculture industry with those in the (2) manufacturing industry, (3) the consulting, finance and insurance industry, and (4) the hospitality, tourism and culture industry. Results: We found that firms in the aquaculture industry emphasize environmental sustainability more than those in the other industries do. Likewise, firms in the aquaculture industry emphasize social sustainability more than those in the other industries do, but the difference is less marked. Across industries, knowledge-intensive firms emphasize environmental sustainability and social sustainability to a lesser extent. Additionally, firms with local or regional major ownership emphasize social sustainability more than those with international major ownership do. Conclusion: Firms in the aquaculture industry have a relatively strong emphasis on environmental and social sustainability, which may be due to the industry's environmental challenges. Similarly, aquaculture firms have a relatively strong emphasis on social sustainability, which may be due to the industry's geographic and sociocultural proximity to numerous small local communities.

AB  - Although it is increasingly recognized that scientific knowledge about climate change needs to be framed and conveyed in ways that resonate with people's livelihoods to motivate societal change, these insights are often neglected in discussions about science-policy interactions. Drawing on empirical studies from Norwegian renewable primary industries, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework for culturally sensitive boundary work for climate change transformation. Our framework combines boundary work theory with cultural theory and examine the production of and engagement with knowledge in innovation and development processes in agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries from three case studies in Norway. The innovation processes are analyzed across four dimensions: degrees of knowledge integration, degrees of participation, learning and negotiation over boundaries. By combining this with an analysis of the actors' way of life according to cultural theory, we are able to compare different configurations of boundary work with ways of life. We find that in innovation processes with egalitarian users there is a high level of knowledge integration, learning and participation, while there is a greater need for dedicated boundary workers in processes with individualist users. We argue that the framework can inform the design and implementation of deliberate coproduction of knowledge for transformation among actors that adheres to different ways of life.

T2  - ORNIS FENNICA
LA  - English
AB  - Since the expansion of the Rustic Bunting (Emberiza rustica) westwards in northern Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries, declines have been reported in Fennoscandia. The Norwegian population was 100-500 breeding pairs in 1994. We carried out censuses to detect Rustic Buntings in Norway during 2008-12, and compared these results with previous records to evaluate recent population changes. Transect censuses made along 15 km of optimal habitat (swamp forest along rivers) yielded 18 territories during 1972-78, but in 2008 we found only 5 territories, and none since 2011. We also detected Rustic Buntings in 21 of 74 previously-occupied sites (one or more records during 1963-2007). During the study period 2008-12, we recorded Rustic Buntings in 41 sites, with a maximum of 47 territories in 2008. However, from 2008 to 2012 we detected a decline of 82% (yearly decline of 34% +/- 9%; 95% CI). Local extinctions occurred in at least 31 sites. The current known population size is 13 territories in 9 sites, and the true population size may be only slightly larger. About half of all territories were associated with beaver dams, but the rate of decline during 2008-12 did not depend on dams. Extinctions could be attributed to habitat loss or change in 9/53 sites (1 logging, 1 cultivation, and 7 loss of a beaver dam). We suggest that the population decline of Norwegian Rustic Buntings is due to factors operating during migration or in wintering areas.

AB  - There are histories and personal narratives that will never reach the public either because they represent difficult memories or because they are of a character that society finds necessary to conceal. This paper will discuss aspects of the heritagisation process of old prison buildings taking place in Norway today. As part of major reforms in the legal system, decisions were made by the young national state in 1857 to build a network of district prisons throughout the country. They were designed in a functional, but partially symbolic form, signalising hierarchy and political power, and many of the buildings that were erected in the following years were based on drawings from some of Norway's most recognised architects. Gradually, the old prisons are now being replaced by new buildings. In the process of filling empty monumental buildings with new functions, new stories are created. The paper investigates closer the effects these changes of functions have had and asks: Are the old prisons remembered primarily as architectural monuments of power and justice, as monuments of social history that include painful personal stories, or do the arguments used by heritage management try to combine various perspectives? The study combines several qualitative methods; in field observations, informal interviews with central actors, and supplementary literature and archive studies. The discussion will be made in view of the processes of re-conceptualisation taking place as part of the position the cultural industries have gained as a new target area in urban municipal policies, as well as discussing the processes of selection in the heritagisation process.

AB  - The development of future food systems will depend on normative decisions taken at different levels by policymakers and stakeholders. Scenario modeling is an adequate tool for assessing the implications of such decisions, but for an enlightened debate, it is important to make explicit and transparent how such value-based decisions affect modeling results. In a participatory approach working with five NGOs, we developed a future food vision for the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through an iterative process of defining the scenario, modeling, and revising the scenario, until a final future food vision was reached. The impacts on food production, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions, and the resulting diets in the food vision, were modeled using a mass flow model of the food system. The food vision formulated was an organic farming system where food is produced locally and livestock production is limited to leftover streams, i.e., by-products from food production and forage from pastures and perennial grass/clover mixtures, thus limiting food-feed competition. Consumption of meat, especially non-ruminant meat, was substantially reduced compared with current consumption in the Nordic countries (-81%). An estimated population of 37 million people could be supplied with the scenario diet, which uses 0.21ha of arable land and causes greenhouse gas emissions of 0.48 tCO(2)e per diet and year. The novelty of this paper includes advancing modeling of sustainable food systems by using an iterative process for designing future food visions based on stakeholder values, which enables results from multidisciplinary modeling (including agronomy, environmental system analysis, animal and human nutrition) to be fed back into the decision-making process, providing an empirical basis for normative decisions and a science-based future vision of sustainable food systems.

AB  - As a result of increasing urbanization, the need for sustainable housing, e.g., tall (over eight-story) timber apartments, is increasing in Finland. Leveraging the experience of key Finnish professionals plays a significant role in the transition and expansion of sustainable timber housing as an essential part of the forest-based bioeconomy. This interview-based study will serve to fill a gap by examining the views of key professionals with experience in tall timber residential construction, using Finland as a case study. The 21 interviews primarily highlighted that: (1) the construction cost was the most important parameter affecting the architectural and structural design; (2) the most critical consideration influencing the overall design was reported to be the structural system selection and structural design, followed by city planning and client control; (3) key professionals assessed the building's form and the main dimensions of the building's mass as the most significant parameters affected by timber construction; (4) the main structural considerations that needed to be developed for tall timber housing were the bracing solutions and fittings, the structures of the intermediate floors, and load-bearing vertical/partition structures; (5) construction preconceptions, the lack of cost-competitiveness, and the lack of construction expertise/actors were considered to be major obstacles; (6) the most important parameters for the future of tall timber apartment buildings were reported to be education, timber construction marketing and public awareness, land delivery conditions, the unification of public administration, and financial support; (7) tall timber building design was reported to be a complex subject that requires close collaboration, especially between the architect, the structural designer and the wood supplier. This paper will help us to understand the boundary conditions affecting the design, the development needs in solutions, the importance of design parameters, the design parameters affected by timber construction, and the prospects, measures and obstacles to tall timber apartments from the perspectives of key Finnish professionals, thereby aiding the sound planning and development of tall timber housing projects.

AB  - How do editorial cartoons represent gambling? What can visually oriented thinking give to gambling research? The answers are rooted in the expanding research about visual culture, methodologies and data in social sciences and cultural studies. The discussion about 170 editorial cartoons from the Finnish print media, from 1961 to 2005, shows how the cartoons profile the Finnish gambler and what emotions are associated with gambling. The discussion then turns to Finnish gambling culture and gambling's role in society. Space, communication, power relations, and the use of gambling as a political metaphor are highlighted. The assessment demonstrates the value of popular-cultural data for gambling studies. The examination complements the existing cartoon research and visual-cultural studies and has interdisciplinary pedagogical potential.

AB  - Climate change is an important driver of range shifts and community composition changes. Still, little is known about how the responses are influenced by the combination of land use, species interactions and species traits. We integrate climate and distributional data for 131 butterfly species in Sweden and Finland and show that cumulative species richness has increased with increasing temperature over the past 120 years. Average provincial species richness increased by 64% (range 15-229%), from 46 to 70. The rate and direction of range expansions have not matched the temperature changes, in part because colonisations have been modified by other climatic variables, land use and vary according to species characteristics representing ecological generalisation and species interactions. Results emphasise the role of a broad ecological filtering, whereby a mismatch between environmental conditions and species preferences limit the ability to disperse and establish populations in emerging climates and novel areas, with potentially widespread implications for ecosystem functioning.
   Century-long data on climate and butterfly distribution show that species richness has increased with increasing temperature, and that the rate and direction of range expansions are influenced by land use, species interactions and species traits.

AB  - Diverse physical features of urban areas alongside socio-demographic characteristics affect car ownership, and hence the daily mobility choices. As a case of sustainable mobility, we explore how various urban environments and socio-demographics associate with the spatial and social distribution of household car ownership and carlessness in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. Three urban fabrics characterizing the study area are established based on the transportation mode (walking, public transportation, or automobile) the physical urban environment primarily supports. The national level Monitoring System of Spatial Structure and Urban Form database, and the National Travel Survey (2016) are utilized to further include spatial and socio-demographic variables into our analysis across these fabrics. Our results show that households with and without cars differ in terms of residential distance to the city center, neighborhood density, house type, and socio-demographic profiles. Single pensioners and students are most likely to be carless, whereas families represent the opposite. Within the carless households the differences are also evident between different groups. For the more affluent households residing in dense and well-connected areas, and mostly possessing driver's licenses, carlessness is presumably a choice. Contrarily, many other carless households represent the less affluent often located in the more distant, low-density, and less accessible areas, while also possessing less driver's licenses, making carlessness more of a constraint, as the local urban fabric does not support such lifestyle. Consequently, carless households should be increasingly recognized as a focus group in sustainable urban planning in terms of identifiable best practices and potential vulnerability.

AB  - In the Iberian Peninsula, the coexistence between pastoral communities and wolves has given origin to a rich ethnographic heritage, expressed in myths and legends, practices related to medical uses of wolf parts, and constructions for hunting wolves. This article assesses such cultural dimension through interviews with inhabitants, field prospecting and a literature review. Our review indicates that cultural manifestations related to wolves are associated with two distinct perceptions of this carnivore: as a real threat to livestock and as a symbolic creature. This cultural legacy is still present in the memory and practices of Iberian rural communities and is unparalleled in other European regions. Ethnographic knowledge can enhance our understanding of the perceptions of local people towards the wolf and help to promote the recreational and utilitarian value of this species as an important element in rural culture and tradition. Such an approach can be crucial in attenuating wolf-human conflict in humanized areas and consequently should be incorporated in wolf conservation and management programs.

This was carried out while controlling for relevant background variables such as gender, age, and levels of educational achievement. In order to obtain the core aim of the study, a self-completion questionnaire was devised and distributed to a representative sample of the Norwegian Population (n = 247) and to a stratified sample in Accra and Cape-Coast in Ghana (n = 299). The results showed that the Ghanaian sample perceived higher traffic risk than the Norwegian sample. Gender, age, and levels of educational achievement exerted minimal influences on risk perception. The results were discussed in context of industrialisation, cultural differences, and health beliefs. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenically elevated Hg deposition in arctic and subarctic ecosystems is potentially a serious environmental problem, particularly in northern Europe and North America. To determine the magnitude of this concern, it is necessary to make an evaluation over abroad spatial scale. In the absence of an established network of atmospheric monitoring stations for Hg deposition, we have utilized sediment flux ratios derived from lake sediment profiles throughout the arctic and subarctic to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of Hg flux to watersheds. Total Hg mass accumulations in layers of Pb-210 dated sediment cores collected from Finland, Sweden; Canada, U.S.A. and Russia were analyzed to construct flux ratios. Flux ratios are calculated by dividing the average recent (i.e. last similar to 10-40 yr) or industrial era Hg flux by an average pre-industrial Hg flux value. Results differ widely across the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere. The highest flux ratios were found in regions associated with strong regional sources of atmospheric Hg emissions such as central and eastern North America and Central Europe. Lakes throughout the U.S. Arctic and the Taimyr Peninsula of Russia showed only slight (similar to 30%) enrichment over background fluxes. Large differences existed in background Hg flux depending on the nature of the watershed geology with some lakes in Alaska exhibiting relatively high concentrations of sediment Hg without evidence of anthropogenic enrichment. In North America, there is a tendency for Hg flux ratios to increase in an southeasterly direction toward the highest concentration of continental emission sources (coal fired power plants. Chlor-alkali plants. metal smelters and waste incinerators). In northern Europe (Sweden and Finland) there is a trend of increasing Hg flux ratios in the north to south direction. Our results suggest that anthropogenic Hg deposition is the dominant regional mercury deposition process in some northern regions but of lesser importance in landscapes highly remote From urban/industrial Hg emissions.

AB  - Concentrations of phosphorus (P), the main limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems, need to be reduced, but this is difficult due to high spatial and temporal variations and limited resources. Reliable targeting of critical source areas, such as erosion-prone fields and parts of fields, is necessary to improve the cost efficiency of mitigation measures. We used high-resolution (2 m x 2 m) distributed modelling to calculate erosion risk for a large area (202 279 km(2)) covering > 90% of Swedish arable land. Comparison of model results with independent farmers' observations in a pilot catchment showed high spatial agreement. The modelled worst case scenario produced reasonable quantitative results comparable to measured 90th percentile values of suspended sediment (SS) loads at both field and small catchment scale (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.001). Overall, loads of SS, especially during extreme episodes, strongly governed losses of unreactive P and total P at both field and catchment scale.

AB  - Many populations of large grazing birds (cranes, geese, swans) have recovered following protection. During migration, these birds often aggregate in large numbers at staging sites and feed on agricultural crops. Because staging sites often coincide with protected wetlands, extensive crop damages may avert both bird and wetland conservation. There is a need to integrate damage mitigation and conservation of large grazing birds staging in agricultural landscapes, based on knowledge of large grazing birds' spacing behavior. Their space use forms the basis for assessment of damage risk and for the scale at which measures should be implemented. We used high resolution GPS location data to assess space use of common cranes (Grus gnus) at an important staging site in south-central Sweden. We focus on daytime behaviour because this is the time when foraging cranes may cause crop damage and when preventive measures such as scaring and culling are conducted. We found that the daily activity area (mean 4.4 km(2)) did not vary within staging periods. Cranes exhibited high site fidelity during staging, as their activity area over the staging period (mean 15.6 km(2)) was considerably smaller than the entire staging site (> 200 km(2)). However, on a daily scale cranes gradually shifted activity areas, forming a space use pattern analogous to overlapping rings. This pattern is presumably explained by heterogeneous and unpredictable food availability caused by continuous changes in agricultural practices, weather conditions and competition. Considering the size of crane activity areas over the staging period and the scale of current damage preventive measures (e.g., hunting permissions given for a few fields [mean size 0.049 km(2)] at a time), we suggest that current preventive measures might be implemented on a too small scale compared to that of crane space use. Our findings highlight the necessity of adapting crop damage preventive measures to the scale of bird space use to facilitate both bird conservation and agricultural practices at wetlands staging sites along the flyways.

AB  - Harvesting large carnivores can be a management tool for meeting politically set goals for their desired abundance. However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide.

AB  - Building a submarine pipeline in the Baltic Sea to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany contradicts targets to reduce fossil fuel dependency and seems to ignore a long history of environmental challenges in the area. This article examines the tensions between the environmental, economic, and national security arguments framing the Swedish government decision to allow the pipeline to be laid on the Baltic seabed passing through the Swedish economic zone. At first sight, the decision seems to run contrary to Sweden's ambitious environmental policy. However, by framing the issue within a broader understanding of the country's tradition of consensual decision-making, and considering the tensions and contradictions inherent in policies for sustainable development, the permission fits well with the logic that, in case of conflict, economic growth is given priority even when the environment is at stake.

AB  - In government, industry and academia, there is a convergence of three trends: (1) the belief that responsible exploration and mining should increase across Europe, (2) industry should follow and 'Europeanise' international good practices and (3) a social licence to operate exists not only between a community and a company but also between society and industry. There are two examples in Europe where these trends are converging-Finland and Spain have both adopted the Canadian Toward Sustainable Mining (TSM) program, but the method of implementation is very different. As a result of Talvivaara, Finland took a network governance approach incorporating trust-building measures from the beginning by bringing diverse stakeholders together to create the Finnish Network for Sustainable Mining. Spain chose to integrate the TSM into their national standards, a more traditional and hierarchical approach but one that also relies on a trustworthy entity with clear longevity. Although implementation is in the early stages in both countries, and therefore this paper provides insights only on preliminary outcomes, results indicate that the network approach may not be better at achieving societal SLO suggesting that other factors such as narrative, dialoguing directly with society, implementing trust-building measures in a timely fashion and proven longevity may have more influence than early trust-building measures between network participants.

AB  - Forest ecosystems provide a range of services and function as habitats for many species. The concept of woodland key habitats (WKH) is important for biodiversity management in forest planning standards and certification schemes. The main idea of the WKH is to preserve biodiversity hotspots in the forest landscape. Current methods used in delineating WKH rely on costly field inventories. Furthermore, it is well known that the surveyor introduces an error because of the subjective assessment. Remote sensing may reduce this error in a cost-efficient way. The current study develops automated methods using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to delineate geomorphological WKH, i.e., rock walls and stream gorges. The methods were evaluated based on a complete field inventory of WKH in a 1600 ha area in south-eastern Norway. The delineated WKH showed high detection rates, minor omission errors, but high commissions errors. Combining the delineation into a map of potential WKH suitable to guide field surveyors resulted in detecting all field reference WKH, i.e., a detection rate of 100% and a commission error of 25%. It is concluded that a higher degree of automatization might be possible to improve results and increase the efficiency of WKH inventories.

AB  - Agri-food sectoris a crucially important part of the society, because it is a major factor affecting public health and welfare and it also contributes - directly and indirectly - both to the environment and to the national gross product and employment. Improving sustainability of the agri-food sector implies production of nutritionally better food by using fewer inputs and by reducing environmental burden.
   In reducing environmental burden, it is essential to restrict the material throughput, to identify the hot spots and direct the measures to them. Improving performance of the food sector requires that the benefits and inputs be quantified in an unambiguous way and that the inputs are estimated for the whole production chain. A comprehensive view of the whole system is necessary.
   Here, the material flow approach (MFA) has been used to describe the Finnish food flux. The quantitative numerical data have been derived from the farm models' data base, and the data have been adjusted so as to comply with the production and consumption statistics of Finland. Using the compiled data an extended input-output model has been constructed. The model allows for the evaluation of some of the economic and environmental consequences, when the structure of food production and the patterns of food consumption are changed. The consequences can be traced within agriculture, within the food sector as a whole, or at the level of the nation-wide economy. in combination with other information the model, thus, serves as a practical tool for planning.
   The paper at hand gives an overview of the data base and the basic calculation principles of the model. The usability of the model is demonstrated with results from modelling examples, in which the share of organic production or the share of vegetarian food in the average Finnish diet has been increased. The possibilities and restrictions of the approach as well as some of the needs for further development are discussed.
   The study is the first step in developing MFA methods to analyse and to monitor the material flows of the Finnish food flux. The results have been used also in compiling the Finnish physical input-output tables. The study, thus, contributes to the overall development of the materials flow accounting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For most of its history, Sweden has been a country dominated by the Lutheran Church, having the status of the official state religion. Starting in mid-to-late 20th century, mass immigration to Europe had a considerable impact on the confessional structure of Sweden 's population. The growing number of refugees from the Balkan Peninsula, the Middle East, and Africa has turned Sweden into a multi-religious state. Sweden has become one of the leaders among the EU countries as far as the growth rates of adherents of Islam are concerned. Immigrants are exposed to adaptation difficulties causing their social, cultural and geographical isolation and making relatively isolated migrant communities emerge. This study aims at finding correlation between the changes in the confessional structure of Swedish population (as a result of the growing number of non-Christians) and the geographical structure of migrant flows into the country. This novel study addresses the mosaic structure of the Swedish religious landscape taking into account the cyclical dynamics of replacement of Protestantism by Islam. The methods we created make it possible to identify further trends in the Swedish religious landscape. This study adds to results of the complex sociological and demographic studies of the confessional structure of the Swedish population.

AB  - The first aim of the present study was to identify key items which are rated differently by drivers from Finland, Sweden, Greece and Turkey. The second aim was to examine how these key items relate to drivers' self-reported accident involvement. Similar comparisons have previously been conducted in Europe but these have only included items classified as violations and errors, but not lapses. A sample of Finnish (N = 200), Swedish (N = 200), Greek (N = 200) and Turkish (N = 200) drivers completed the driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) and reported their accident involvement during the previous 3 years. The results showed that nine key items (which drivers from different countries rated differently) could be identified. These items included two aggressive violations, four ordinary violations, three lapses, but no errors. Out of these nine items, five items (Become angered by a certain type of driver and indicate your hostility by whatever means you can, Disregard the speed limit on a motorway, Overtake a slow driver on the inside, Pull out of a junction solar that the driver with right of way has to stop and let you out and Get into the wrong lane approaching a roundabout or a junction) could explain differences in drivers' self-reported yearly accident involvement when all four countries were taken together. At the same time, none of the items could explain differences in self-reported yearly accident involvement in Finland and Sweden while one of the items (Overtake a slow driver on the inside) could explain differences in self-reported yearly accident involvement in Greece and two of the items (Become angered by a certain type of driver and indicate your hostility by whatever means you can and Disregard the speed limit on a residential road) could explain differences in self-reported yearly accident involvement in Turkey. This shows that different countries have different problems with regard to aberrant driving behaviours which need to be taken into account when promoting traffic safety interventions and the driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) can be used to diagnose risk areas and to better inform road safety practitioners within and between countries.

AB  - This article advocates the need for strategic spatial planning practices to cope with the crises of climate change that confront cities and regions today. Planners face sustainability challenges regarding their ability to plan for the cities of tomorrow. The aim of this article is to analyse how institutional conditions can enable the planners' strategic spatial planning for sustainable development in Swedish municipalities. We will use institutional capacity as a theoretical framework to understand how the planners use planning instruments while planning for sustainable development. Our empirical research builds on four Swedish municipalities where we have set out to explore knowledge resources, relational resources and mobilization capacity for analysing planners' use of planning instruments for sustainable development. Our results indicate that the institutional capacity in the municipalities does not enable the planners to strive for sustainable development. Planners in Swedish municipalities have many ideas, visions and initiatives for sustainable development, but are often not informed of the political agenda or how to prioritize. For achieving strategic spatial planning, the planners will need a more clear political will and mandate to act and prioritize.

AB  - As one of the most common reasons for slippery roads in wintertime, hoar frost can reduce surface friction and affect traffic safety. The risk of winter road hoar frost is subjected to changes in the warming climate. A better understanding of these changes could lead to improved forecasting of hoar frost risk and provide information to policymakers in making climate adaptation strategies. In this work, the decadal variation in winter road hoar frost risk between 2000 and 2016 in Sweden was examined by using in situ observations from 244 stations in the Swedish Road Weather Information System. Results show that hoar frost risks have decreased in the south of Sweden (south of 59 degrees N), whilst increasing in central Sweden (approximately 59 degrees-65 degrees N). Hoar frost risk tends to increase (decrease) in regions where there is a relatively high (low) mean number of hoar frost risk days. Further analysis indicates that the strengthened winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the last few decades, which resulted in warmer and wetter winters in Sweden, is the main cause of the changes. During strong positive NAO winters, the frequency of blocking anticyclones centred to the south-west of Sweden significantly decreased and led to more warm and moist air from south-west being transported to Sweden. The reduction in hoar frost risk in the southern part of Sweden is mainly due to an increase in road surface temperature, while the increasing hoar frost risk in central Sweden is dominated by the increase in relative humidity, which favours the occurrence of hoar frost.

AB  - Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is undergoing major changes due mainly to high recovery rate targets being set by the European Union and national Governments. These higher rates have been set as one measure to achieve the sustainable development required by Agenda 21 of United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. Increasing the recovery rates for municipal solid waste affects waste management systems, particularly the composition of waste streams, costs and emissions from treatment and disposal activities.
   A case study has been carried out in Finland to measure the effects of the increase in recovery rates using the Mimes/Waste computer model as a tool. In the case study, it was ascertained that when the recovery rate is increased from the present 21% to 64%, the total waste management costs are increased by 36%, Using the same parameters, it was found that the amount of waste being disposed of to landfill is reduced from 421 kg per person per annum to 195 kg per per son per annum.
   The effect on greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce the amount produced by landfill sites and traffic by 59%. Traffic emissions overall, however, are increased by 40% in the case study.
   The "New Mimes/Waste" version developed for Finland has proved to be a suitable tool for strategic waste planning. It offers the capacity to study a number of different strategies and the whole MSWM system as a single unit. It also facilitates and increases the understanding of the interdependence of the various waste streams and functional elements.

AB  - This paper presents a case study about perceptions of residents about the value of publicly funded art and culture institutions (museums, city theatre, and symphony orchestra) in the Finnish city of Jyvaskyla. In this study, the kinds of value that residents attribute to these local art and culture institutions and what kind of economic value the visitors' expenditure to these institutions illustrates are explored. The analysis in this study is based on a survey conducted in 2019 that included the visitors and non-visitors to these institutions as participants. The results illustrate several values of art and culture institutions, which also point to multiple policy domains related to art, economy, social, and wellbeing effects. According to previous studies on cultural policy, it is important to be aware of the various value dimensions of future cultural policy. Though there are conflicting aims regarding cultural values, varied value dimensions complement each other in future-oriented policies.

AB  - The former agricultural use of two sites located in the boreal forest of eastern Norway is investigated through pollen analysis. A peat profile was taken from the vicinity in each of two clearance cairn fields where several cairns were analysed for pollen. The pollen samples from the peat profiles give an environmental context for the pollen samples from the clearance cairns, and this combination of samples assists in evaluating the management practices that were in place on the cairn fields during different time periods. In both study areas cultivation layers under the clearance cairns are dated to the Late Roman Iron Age (cal. AD 200-400), while the oldest clearance cairns are dated to the Migration period (cal. AD 400-570), and a second phase of clearance cairn establishment is dated to the Medieval period (cal. AD 1030-1537). Abandonment of the two cairn fields is dated to c. AD 1700. Pioneer trees were a feature on or around the clearance cairn fields during most of the Iron Age, whereas the cairn fields were more open in medieval times. The investigation suggests that cereal cultivation on the clearance cairn fields is difficult to detect in local peat deposits, and that caution is needed when interpreting lack of Cerealia pollen. Management practices on the cairn fields are discussed and a change in management practice is indicated in association with medieval intensification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the history of ancestral tourism and its development as a form of cultural diplomacy between 1945 and 1966. The phenomenon often referred to as 'roots tourism' has during the last decades increased in popularity, especially in Old World countries that historically have sent large numbers of people to North America. While previous scholarship has focused on its existential dimensions and its relation to the twenty-first century tourism and heritage economies, this article looks at how ancestral tourism grew out of European attempts at expanding the tourism industry after 1945. It studies the international spread of 'person-to-person' programs that sought to turn travelers into 'ambassadors', and the subsequent transformation of such initiatives into 'homecoming' campaigns through notions of co-descent, targeting Americans of European descent. By exploring the case of the 1966 Homecoming Year campaign in Sweden, the article shows that the attraction of ancestral tourism was grounded in its ability to combine economic and political incentives articulated in the Marshall Plan. It developed out of a liberal-democratic ideology that vested individual travelers with diplomatic agency. In the process, European tourist agencies calcified the notion that ancestral tourism served not only individual experiences, but also national economies and international relations.

AB  - Smart city experiments have the potential to reshape urban climate change governance. Smart city initiatives have been supported by international technology companies and the European Union for many years and continue to be promoted by national and municipal governments. In relation to sustainability and climate change, such initiatives promise more efficient use of resources through the use of information and communications technology in energy infrastructure. Experiments with smart city technologies such as urban smart grids have shown the potential to restructure relationships between energy utilities, energy users and other actors by reconfiguring the dynamics of energy supply and demand. But do urban experiments lead to institutional change? The aim of the article is to provide a better understanding of how smart city experiments reshape the urban governance of building energy use. Hyllie, a new city district in Malmo, Sweden, was home to two smart city experiments that contributed to the institutionalization of urban smart grid technology. However, the analysis of Hyllie's policy assemblages shows that this institutional change could redefine sustainability at the expense of energy efficiency.

AB  - In research to date, projected climate change has been considered to be beneficial for agriculture under Nordic conditions, where crop production is mainly limited by low temperatures resulting in short growing seasons. However, with the rapid increases in global mean temperature implied at the high end of the uncertainty range of current projections, which are typically amplified at high latitudes, conditions for crop production could change so dramatically that yields would be reduced, even accounting for the positive effects of CO2 fertilization.
   In this study, we used the WOFOST crop growth simulation model to examine crop yield responses to a set of plausible scenarios of climate change for Finland up to 2100, including some that exceed 4 degrees C global mean temperature increase relative to pre-industrial. We selected spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L) as an indicator crop and calculated water-limited yields for two Finnish locations, Jokioinen and Jyvaskyla and fora clay and a sandy soil. Scenarios included systematic increases in temperatures, changes in precipitation distribution and altered daily climatic variability using the M&Rfi weather generator. We also examined the effectiveness of a few adaptation options, such as shifts in sowing dates and hypothetical new crop cultivars.
   Increasing temperature reduced total growth duration and yield considerably, even with adjusted earlier sowing. A reduced number of rainy days had marked negative effects only in combination with increases in temperature of 4 degrees C or greater, leading to distinctly higher yield losses on the sandy soil than on the clay. Prolonged dry spells clearly increased yield variability. For scenarios with temperature increases of +6 degrees C and +7 degrees C, yield losses at Jokioinen were highest; losses at Jyyaskyla were generally less pronounced. Neither CO2 fertilization nor adjusted sowing could compensate the yield losses from temperature changes exceeding +4 degrees C. On clay soils, yield loss could be compensated by new cultivars. For sandy soils even with new cultivars, there would be yield loss at temperature increases exceeding +3 degrees C.
   It can be concluded that the positive effects of climate warming and elevated CO2 concentrations on cereal production at high latitudes are likely to be reversed at temperature increases exceeding 4 degrees C, with a high risk of marked yield loss. Only plant breeding efforts aimed at increasing yield potential jointly with drought resistance and adjusted agronomic practices, such as sowing, and adequate nitrogen fertilizer management and plant protection, holds a prospect of partly restoring yield levels and reducing the risks of yield shortfall.

AB  - Questions: Substantial variation between observers has been found when comparing parallel land-cover maps, but how can we know which map is better? What magnitude of error and inter-observer variation is expected when assigning land-cover types and is this affected by the hierarchical level of the type system, observer characteristics, and ecosystem properties? Study area: Hvaler, south-cast Norway. Methods: Eleven observers assigned mapping units to 120 stratified random points. At each observation point, the observers first assigned a mapping unit to the point independently. The group then decided on a 'true' reference mapping unit for that point. The reference was used to estimate total error. 'Ecological distance' to the reference was calculated to grade the errors. Results: Individual observers frequently assigned different mapping units to the same point. Deviating assignments were often ecologically close to the reference. Total error, as percentage of assignments that deviated from the reference, was 35.0% and 16.4% for low and high hierarchical levels of the land-covertype system, respectively. The corresponding figures for inter-observer variation were 42.8% and 19.4%, respectively. Observer bias was found. Particularly high error rates were found for land-cover types characterised by human disturbance. Conclusions: Access to a 'true' mapping unit for each observation point enabled estimation of error in addition to the inter-observer variation typically estimated by the standard pairwise comparisons method for maps and observers. Three major sources of error in the assignment of land-cover types were observed: dependence on system complexity represented by the hierarchical level of the land-cover-type system, dependence on the experience and personal characteristics of the observers, and dependence on properties of the mapped ecosystem. The results support the necessity of focusing on quality in land-cover mapping, among commissioners, practitioners and other end users.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses actual and potential successes and failures in the transition of the Offshore Oil Industry from the risk management paradigm to the risk governance regime in three reference countries, namely the United Kingdom (UK) & Norway in the North and Greece in the South of Europe. The methodological approaches used in this research are both theoretical and empirical, such as: (a) a literature review on the transition from the Risk Analysis and Management to the Risk Governance paradigm; (b) a historical analysis of the institutional framework holding for Health and safety (H&S) at sea in connection with major disasters or accidents as milestone events; (c) analyses of the three countries' experiences and prospects regarding transition of their offshore oil industry to the risk governance model. Among the findings of the study is the necessity for a thorough review of the European Union (EU) legal framework in the area of Risk Governance at sea in order to take account of the cultural, socio-economic and geopolitical diversity among its Sea Regions. Mere transfer of the "best practices" from the European North to the South may create more tension, and may entail new or invigorate pre-existing geopolitical risks.

AB  - We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of bleeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were significantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Numbers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance df short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed elsewhere. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small-and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.

AB  - An evaluation of the negative effects caused by anthropogenic influence on lake ecosystems was performed, using data from 143 catchments in Uppsala County, Sweden. The study included i) technical encroachments; i.e. construction of dams, dikes, etc. as well as effects of drainage of land; ii) pollution, i.e. eutrophication, acidification, and contamination by toxic substances; iii) introduction of nonnative species; and iv) exploitation of species populations. Severe damage was caused mostly by drainage of land followed by pollution by toxic substances and, to a smaller extent, introduction of nonnative species and eutrophication. Most lakes were subject to several types of disturbances, interacting in a complex pattern, which made it difficult to link the visible effects to the true causes of the disturbance. Future lake management should include analyses of all disturbances to the lake catchments, taking into account the historical perspective, in order to balance the threats/damages, in an analysis of the possibilities for maintaining biodiversity and sustainability in the ecosystems.

AB  - Anthropogenic impact over the Pasvik River (Arctic Norway) is mainly caused by emissions from runoff from smelter and mine wastes, as well as by domestic sewage from the Russian, Norwegian, and Finnish settlements situated on its catchment area. In this study, sediment samples from sites within the Pasvik River area with different histories of metal input were analyzed for metal contamination and occurrence of metal-resistant bacteria in late spring and summer of 2014. The major differences in microbial and chemical parameters were mostly dependent on local inputs than seasonality. Higher concentrations of metals were generally detected in July rather than May, with inner stations that became particularly enriched in Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, but without significant differences. Bacterial resistance to metals, which resulted from viable counts on amended agar plates, was in the order Ni2+>Pb2+>Co2+>Zn2+>Cu2+>Cd2+>Hg2+, with higher values that were generally determined at inner stations. Among a total of 286 bacterial isolates (mainly achieved from Ni- and Pb-amended plates), the 7.2% showed multiresistance at increasing metal concentration (up to 10,000ppm). Selected multiresistant isolates belonged to the genera Stenotrophomonas, Arthrobacter, and Serratia. Results highlighted that bacteria, rapidly responding to changing conditions, could be considered as true indicators of the harmful effect caused by contaminants on human health and environment and suggested their potential application in bioremediation processes of metal-polluted cold sites.

AB  - We studied the effect of forest fragmentation on the insect community inhabiting an old-growth forest specialist bracket fungus, Fomitopsis rosea, in eastern Finland. Samples of the fungus from large non-isolated control areas were compared with samples from forest fragments in two isolation time classes; 2-7 yr and 12-32 yr since isolation. Fomitopsis rosea hosted a species-rich community with relatively many specialized old-growth forest insects. The numerically dominant food chain consisted of F. rosea, the tineid moth. Agnathosia mendicella and the tachinid fly Elfia cingulata, a specialist parasitoid of A. mendicella. The frequency of F. rosea on suitable fallen spruce logs and the frequency of A. mendicella in fruiting bodies were significantly lower in the forest fragments than in the control areas. The median number of trophic levels decreased from three in the control areas to one in the fragments that had been isolated for the longest period of time. The parasitoid was completely missing from the fragments isolated for 12-32 yr. Our results show that in boreal forests habitat loss and fragmentation truncate food chains of specialized species in the course of time since isolation.

AB  - Benthic faunal data is regularly collected worldwide to assess the ecological quality of marine environments. Recently, there has been renewed interest in developing biological indices able to identify environmental status and potential anthropogenic impacts. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a general polychaete/amphipod ratio along the Norwegian continental shelf as an environmental indicator for offshore oil and gas impacts. Two main trends are apparent: first, a contamination gradient is discernible from where production takes place compared to stations 10,000 m away. Second, the quality of the marine environment has improved over time. These results are consistent with monitoring reports employing a combination of uni- and multi-variate statistics. Thus, we consider this ratio as a relatively simple, useful and potentially cost-effective complement to other more demanding assessment techniques. Because of its strong theoretical basis, it may also be useful for detecting ecological change as a result of other activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development since the beginning of the 20th century of the pollen-analytical theory and method as a palaeoecological tool for describing landscape development is outlined with reference to southern Scandinavia. Numerical methods applied since the 1980s are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a new perspective on the landscape development and human impact during the Holocene by applying the Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model to the pollen records from the reference site Lake Farskesjon in SE Sweden. The model was applied both to a previously published record (core 1956, entire Holocene until ad 1600) and a newly collected dataset (core 2013, the last 3000years). The comparison between the REVEALS estimates of vegetation cover and historical landscape maps indicate that traditional, uncorrected pollen percentages significantly underestimate the degree of landscape openness created by long-term farming and pasturing, but that the degree of underestimation varies over time, depending on the species composition of both the forest and the open-land communities. The REVEALS reconstructions are also a useful tool for the quantification of past land-use changes that may have affected the nutrient loading to the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The characteristics of groundwater systems and groundwater contamination in Finland, Norway and Iceland are presented, as they relate to outbreaks of disease. Disparities among the Nordic countries in the approach to providing safe drinking water from groundwater are discussed, and recommendations are given for the future. Groundwater recharge is typically high in autumn or winter months or after snowmelt in the coldest regions. Most inland aquifers are unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution, but they are often without much anthropogenic influence and the water quality is good. In coastal zones, previously emplaced marine sediments may confine and protect aquifers to some extent. However, the water quality in these aquifers is highly variable, as the coastal regions are also most influenced by agriculture, sea-water intrusion and urban settlements resulting in challenging conditions for water abstraction and supply. Groundwater is typically extracted from Quaternary deposits for small and medium municipalities, from bedrock for single households, and from surface water for the largest cities, except for Iceland, which relies almost entirely on groundwater for public supply. Managed aquifer recharge, with or without prior water treatment, is widely used in Finland to extend present groundwater resources. Especially at small utilities, groundwater is often supplied without treatment. Despite generally good water quality, microbial contamination has occurred, principally by norovirus and Campylobacter, with larger outbreaks resulting from sewage contamination, cross-connections into drinking water supplies, heavy rainfall events, and ingress of polluted surface water to groundwater.

AB  - Context. Nest predation is a major factor influencing life history and population dynamics of ground-nesting birds. The transitions between the northern boreal mountain birch forests and the low-alpine tundra are important habitats for the willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus (Linnaeus, 1758). During the past decades, these landscapes have been extensively developed with cabin resorts in southern Norway, which has led to an increased number of roads and foot paths in relatively undisturbed habitats.
   Aims. The aim of the present study was to investigate relative nest-predation rates in elevation gradients (ecotones) spanning from northern boreal mountain birch forests to low-alpine tundra in three locations with contrasting willow ptarmigan densities.
   Methods. We conducted an artificial nest study by using baited track boards (n = 108). Track boards were placed along transects (200 m) in the following three habitat types: birch forest, edge habitat and low-alpine tundra. Predator prevalence was analysed in relation to study-design variables (location, habitat, study period) and the load of human infrastructure (i.e. distance to foot paths and roads), using generalised linear mixed-effect models assuming binomial distribution for the response variable.
   Key results. Prevalence of avian predators was consistently high (range 38.2-85.3%), in contrast to much lower prevalence of mammalian predators (range 2.8-22.9%). Raven (Corvus corax) was the dominant nest predator, followed by hooded crow (C. cornix) and pine marten (Martes martes). Location, as contrasted by differences in willow ptarmigan density, was not significantly related to total relative predation rates. Species-specific predator prevalence was habitat specific and related to human infrastructure, but with opposite relative predation patterns between pine marten and raven. Hooded crow predation was similar across the ecotone and not related to human infrastructure.
   Conclusions. Predator prevalence was habitat specific and affected by human infrastructure (distance to human foot paths). Our study confirmed that human activity might alter the predation rates by generalist species in these low-alpine environments.
   Implications. We recommend that attractive willow ptarmigan habitat should be avoided when planning human infrastructure in alpine ecosystems. To reduce predation pressure in this ecosystem, it appears that generalist predators should be considered for management actions. Further research is needed to explain the underlying mechanism driving expansion of generalist species into alpine habitats. Such knowledge is also important in developing alternative management actions with focus other than predator control.

AB  - The majority of the carbon worldwide is in soil. In a river catchment, the tight relationship between soil, water and climate makes carbon likely to be eroded and transported from the soil to the rivers. There are multiple variables which can trigger and accelerate the process. In order to assess the importance of the factors involved, and their interactions resulting in the changes in the carbon cycle within catchments, we have studied the catchments of 26 Finnish rivers from 2000 to 2019. These catchments are distributed all over Finland, but we have grouped them into three categories: southern, peatland and northern. We have run a boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis on chemical, physical, climatic and anthropogenic factors to determine their influence on the variations of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. TOC concentration has decreased in Finland between 2000 and 2019 by 0.91 mg/l, driven principally by forest ditching and % old forest in the catchment. Old forest is especially dominant in the northern catchments with an influence on TOC of 40.5%. In southern and peatland catchments, average precipitation is an important factor to explain the changes in TOC whilst in northern catchments, organic fields have more influence.

AB  - This article examines the institutionalization of organic agriculture in Finland's agricultural policy. Organic agriculture is one of the main alternatives for conventional food production, promoting values that go beyond the focus on productivity and profit. Yet, numerous studies have raised concerns over the changes institutionalization has produced in its transformative capacity. It has been claimed that institutionalization results in the economization of organic agriculture, whereby the goals of this alternative mode of production are displaced by market coordination and profit maximization. However, studies have also called for more detailed analyses, which would account for e.g. national variations in the development of organic agriculture. To further this discussion, we apply conventions theory to analyze how policy documents, strategy papers, and studies have justified the institutionalization of organic agriculture in official policy in Finland. Conventions theory has the benefit of examining both the moral arguments and the knowledge production related to this. From this perspective, we investigate how organic values have been shaped and how policies have attempted to resolve tensions between conflicting justifications. The results show that compromises between organic values and economic rationales have been used to promote organic agriculture, which has also promoted economization. However, the results also indicate that in addition to economization, organic values have faced other challenges. The value of organic agriculture has been questioned based on, for example, scientific measurements of organic products, and by comparisons to Finnish conventional production. Both challenges have questioned the significance of organic agriculture in terms of its health and ecological benefits. The results therefore indicate that more contextualized analytical models are needed when examining the institutionalization of organic agriculture.

AB  - We conducted a paleolimnological study to examine how changes in human activity interacted with climate to influence productivity and biodiversity over the past millennium in oligotrophic Lake Atnsjoen, SE Norway. The study included analyses of sediment geochemistry, subfossil diatoms and cladocerans, and macrofossils. Results were compared with the historical record of human activities in the catchment, pollen analysis and paleoclimate inferences from the lake. During the first 750 years of the record (1000-1750 CE), a time of relatively low human activity, lake productivity and biodiversity were strongly related to climate. During the Little Ice Age (1550-1800 CE), lake productivity and diatom diversity were constrained by cold climate. A century of climate warming (1780-1880 CE) initiated an increase in productivity. Accelerated human settlement after 1850 CE, however, had an even stronger impact on productivity, mediated by increased agriculture and/or forestry, which led to greater nutrient loading of the lake. Similarly, diatoms in the lake responded to the rise in temperature, but increasing human activity also had a moderate impact on the diatom community, which displayed weak signs of nutrient enrichment. From 1980 to 1990 CE onwards, lake productivity declined as a consequence of a recent decrease in human activity and changing land use. The human-induced increase in lake productivity starting ca. 1850 CE propagated through the food web and increased consumer productivity, as reflected by greater accumulation rates of cladocerans, trichopterans and turbellarians. The cladoceran community was likely under top-down control of fish, as indicated by changes in size structure and diversity. Our study showed that increasing human activity during the settlement period had a stronger impact on lake productivity than did climate. Furthermore, the slight human-mediated increase in nutrient loading had different impacts on productivity and biodiversity in the study lake. This study demonstrates that even relatively small changes in human activities in watersheds can have measurable impacts on nutrient-poor lakes.

AB  - Soil nematodes were studied in five alpine habitats (sedge mat, pasture, peat bog, moraine, and lichen heath) in the Austrian Alps (Obergural, Tyrol) from 2001 to 2002. A total of 75 genera within 49 families were found. The mean nematode population density ranged from 80 to 383 individuals 100 g(-1) soil and increased during the short alpine growing season. The most abundant feeding groups were bacterial feeders followed by plant-parasitic nematodes. The number of nematode taxa differed only slightly between habitats. Diversity indices (H' = 3.7-4.8 based on genera) and maturity indices (MI = 2.7-3.4) were generally high. Nematode community composition of the pasture and the peat bog differed markedly from the other three sites. Nematode data on genera and feeding types yielded a comparable similarity pattern for all sites but site discrimination was better at the genus level.

AB  - Conventional dredging of ditches and streams to ensure agricultural drainage and flood mitigation can have severe environmental impacts. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential benefits of an alternative, nature-based two-stage channel (TSC) design with floodplains excavated along the main channel. Through a literature survey, investigations at Finnish field sites and expert interviews, we assessed the performance, costs, and monetary environmental benefits of TSCs in comparison to conventional dredging, as well as the bottlenecks in their financing and governance. We found evidence supporting the expected longer-term functioning of drainage as well as larger plant and fish biodiversity in TSCs compared to conventional dredging. The TSC design likely improves water quality since the floodplains retain suspended sediment and phosphorus and remove nitrogen. In the investigated case, the additional value of phosphorus retention and conservation of protected species through the TSC design was 2.4 times higher than the total costs. We demonstrate how TSCs can be made eligible for the obligatory vegetated riparian buffer of the European Union agri-environmental subsidy scheme (CAP-AES) by optimising their spatial application with respect to other buffer measures, and recommend to publicly finance their additional costs compared to conventional dredging at priority sites. Further studies on biodiversity impacts and long-term performance of two-stage channels are required.

AB  - We studied the relative importance of local habitat conditions and landscape structure for species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in dry grasslands on the Baltic island of Oland (Sweden). In addition, we tested whether relationships between species richness and vegetation cover indicate that competition within and between the studied taxonomic groups is important. We recorded species numbers of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in 4 m(2) plots (n = 452), distributed over dry grassland patches differing in size and degree of isolation. Structural and environmental data were collected for each plot. We tested effects of local environmental conditions, landscape structure and vegetation cover on species richness using generalized linear mixed models. Different environmental variables explained species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. Environmental effects, particularly soil pH, were more important than landscape structure. Interaction effects of soil pH with other environmental variables were significant in vascular plants. Plot heterogeneity enhanced species richness. Size and degree of isolation of dry grassland patches significantly affected bryophyte and lichen species richness, but not that of vascular plants. We observed negative relationships between bryophyte and lichen species richness and the cover of vascular plants. To conclude, effects of single environmental variables on species richness depend both on the taxonomic group and on the combination of environmental factors on a whole. Dispersal limitation in bryophytes and lichens confined to dry grasslands may be more common than is often assumed. Our study further suggests that competition between vascular plants and cryptogams is rather asymmetric.

AB  - Aquaculture is providing an increasingly larger proportion of the world's protein for human consumption; however, its environmental impact is a bottleneck for sustainable expansion. In Norway, the government has enacted a framework where salmon lice-induced mortality in wild salmonid populations is used for assessing the environmental sustainability in production zones. Direct measurements of the level of lice-induced mortality on wild salmonids are difficult to acquire, thus comprehensive sustainability assessments are based on a set of evidence-based proxies. One such proxy is the infestation pressure from a bio-hydrodynamic model, from which we develop an index that summarize the sustainability of aquaculture in terms of lice infestation. This index is based on the proportion of areas with elevated lice loads, and is a novel approach used to investigate how sustainability could be achieved through scenario testing of different management strategies. The analyses identified a mismatch between legal and sustainable lice levels, but also a beneficial effect of reducing lice levels on farms. This study's approach demonstrated how bio-hydrodynamic models might be used to assess sustainability and to predict the necessary reduction of lice larvae from farms to classify the entire Norwegian aquaculture industry as environmentally sustainable.

AB  - The majority of Finnish forests (95%) are certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). It is a worldwide leading forest certification scheme. The aim of this study is to analyze the Finnish National Standard of PEFC certification and identify the indicators that can be reliably estimated with remote sensing (RS) techniques. The retrieved data are further verified with a chosen geographical information system (GIS) application. The rapid increase in certified areas globally has created a certain level of mistrust that makes the evaluation by certification bodies (CB) questionable. Firstly, the area of the field audit is limited, and the verification results are based on sampling techniques. Secondly, the evaluation of the indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) is based on auditor expertise and thus is prone to bias. Thirdly, the actual condition of large forest stands in Eastern and Northern Finland are not easy to determine and verify. Thus, PEFC certification in Finland, in particular, faces numerous challenges in regard to the quality of field assessment due to the intensive forest management model with a high number of annual felling sites. At the same time, small scale and scattered harvesting sites are difficult to assess. Our proposed approach combined with remote assessment reliably verified 18% of the standard and could substantially reduce the costs associated with field audits in Finland. The results from our verification analysis are spatially explicit and geographically referenced and can be published in open access portals for interested parties. Moreover, it provides improved transparency in field assessments for the PEFC certification. The novel approach proposed here requires further investigation at larger scales (e.g., national level).

AB  - Nutrient losses from headwater catchments (<50 km(2)) cause eutrophication problems downstream. Catchment properties are strongly reflected in the levels of nutrient concentrations in headwater streams. Based on measurements of total and dissolved nitrogen (TN, DN) and phosphorus (TP, DP) in 235 small headwater streams, we showed that proportion of arable land in a catchment had the strongest positive effect on nutrient concentrations, with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.54, 0.64, 0.45, and 0.51 for TN, DN, TP, and DP, respectively. In contrast, increased proportion of forest and wetland led to lower nutrient concentrations in streams. The geological composition of catchments had a major influence on the soil properties. In turn, certain soil properties, such as clay content and content of aluminum (Al), an important binding agent of P. influenced losses of particulate P (PP) and DP, respectively. Consequently, by using soil properties as a link between geology and water quality, areas potentially sensitive to nutrient losses were identified by classifying bedrock categories into three geological groups. Approximately 25% of Swedish arable land was identified as potentially sensitive. Sensitive catchments were found in regions with sedimentary bedrock and showed higher concentrations of dissolved nutrient fractions even when the proportion of agricultural land was small, indicating higher background concentrations.

AB  - This paper examines urban patterns of car sharing supply and demand at neighbourhood level. By using literature on spatial inequality and unequal mobility access, we provide new insights into the urban geographies of car sharing. We draw on register data of members and vehicles of station-based car sharing for Oslo, Norway, spatially coupled with population composition, urban form and public transport accessibility ratios. We find both the demand and supply of stationbased car sharing to be unevenly distributed. Some of the most profound contributors to car sharing demand include middle income levels, middle and higher levels of education, higher shares of the population working in cultural sectors, higher shares of men, higher shares of multifamily housing, and higher strengths of the public transport regime compared to that of the private car. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for sustainable urban mobility, mobility justice and urban and transport planning.

AB  - Graph theory and network analysis have become established as promising ways to efficiently explore and analyze landscape or habitat connectivity. However, little attention has been paid to making these graph-theoretic approaches operational within landscape ecological assessments, planning. and design. In this paper, a set of both theoretical and practical methodological developments are presented to address this issue. In highly fragmented landscapes, many species are restricted to moving among small, scattered patches of different resources. instead of one, large patch. A life-cycle based approach is therefore introduced, in which a metapatch is constructed, spanning over these resources, scattered across the landscape. The importance of spatially explicit and geographically defined representations of the network in urban and regional planning and design is stressed, and appropriate, context-dependent visualizations of these are suggested based on experience from real-world planning cases. The study moves beyond the issue of conservation of currently important structures, and seeks to identify suitable redesigns of the landscape to improve its social-ecological qualities, or increase resilience. By introducing both a system-centric and a site-centric analysis, two conflicting perspectives can be addressed. The first answers the question "what can I do for the network", and the second, "what can the network do for me". A method for typical planning strategies within each of these perspectives is presented. To illustrate the basic principles of the proposed methods, an ecological study on the European common toad (Bufo bufo) in Stockholm. Sweden is presented, using the betweenness centrality index to capture important stepping-stone structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Awareness of water's value, high water losses, occasional water shortages and increased costs arising from new treatment requirements has increased focus on reducing water losses. For water loss management, SELL (sustainable economic level of leakage), can be used. SELL includes not only the long-term utility costs and benefits, but also external social and environmental leakage costs, including traffic disruption during pipe repair and replacement work, carbon footprints and health risk effects from leaking pipes with inadequate pressure. The aim of the project was to adapt SELL to Norwegian and Swedish conditions and prepare a calculation model for SELL for use by water utilities. A spreadsheet was developed to calculate water balances and leakage. Another was developed for calculating SELL for the utility. The latter spreadsheet includes research-based default values if no local data are available. An uncertainty analysis was used to show how much input data uncertainty affects the result. The conclusions are that, when all externalities are included and new leak reduction techniques are developed, SELL is lower than expected. The authors believe that the manual will help significantly in fighting water losses, especially for small- and medium- scale water utilities.

AB  - During the twenty-first century, large carnivores have increased in human dominated landscapes after being extinct or nearly extinct. This has resulted in increasing numbers of livestock killed by large carnivores. The intent of this paper is to give a land use-historical perspective on the recent livestock-carnivore conflict in boreal Sweden. More specifically we address: (1) depredation risks (livestock killed by carnivores) and (2) local knowledge of how to protect livestock from predation and whether it survived among pastoralists until the present. This study provides numeric information on carnivores, livestock and depredation, combined with oral information from summer farmers about livestock protection. We compare recent (since 1998) and historical (late nineteenth century) depredation rates in two Swedish counties. In Dalarna recent depredation rates are higher than historical rates while the opposite pattern is seen in Jamtland. Recent depredation rates in Dalarna are twice the recent rates in Jamtland, in contrast to the historical situation. Recent and historical depredation rates are of the same order. Summer farmers traditionally graze their livestock in forested areas where carnivores reside. Interviews show that traditional knowledge of how to protect livestock from carnivores was lost during the twentieth century, but recently new knowledge has developed leading to changes in summer farming practices. The carnivore-livestock situation today differs from the historical situation, not so much in levels of depredation, but mainly regarding the possibilities of farmers to face challenges associated with increasing carnivore populations.

AB  - This paper presents a knowledge infrastructure which has recently been implemented as a genuine novelty at the leading Swedish mountain tourism destination, Are. By applying a Business Intelligence approach, the Destination Management Information System Are (DMIS-Are) drives knowledge creation and application as a precondition for organizational learning at tourism destinations. Schianetz, Kavanagh, and Lockington's (2007) concept of the 'Learning Tourism Destination' and the 'Knowledge Destination Framework' introduced by Hopken, Fuchs, Keil, and Lexhagen (2011) build the theoretical fundament for the technical architecture of the presented Business Intelligence application.
   After having introduced the development process of indicators measuring destination performance as well as customer behaviour and experince the paper highlights how DMIS-Are can be used by tourism managers to gain new knowledge about customer-based destination processes focused on pre- and post-travel phases, like "Web-Navigation", "Booking" and "Feedback". After a concluding discussion about the various components building the prototypically implemented BI-based DMIS infrastructure with data from destination stakeholders, the agenda of future research is sketched. The agenda considers, for instance, the application of real-time Business Intelligence to gain real-time knowledge on tourists' on-site behaviour at tourism destinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ship finds in Norwegian waters that are more than 100 years old came under the jurisdiction of the Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) in 1963, when section 12a of the Norwegian Cultural Heritage Act was implemented. As a consequence, a functional division between land and sea was created where management objects receive different values depending on whether or not they belong to a ship. The objective of this paper is to review Norwegian CHM underwater policy, and discuss the creation of a new management object and its borders with the introduction of a section on ship finds specifically focusing on Actor Network Theory. It is argued that the understanding of the ship find and its belongings can not be understood as something based on inherent qualities to the management object. Instead this paper proposes to comprehend the ship find as a phenomenon held together within a heterogeneous network.

AB  - According to earlier views, the southern coast of Finland was a peripheral area until the 12th and 13th centuries, when Swedish colonists arrived with technological advances and the maritime landscape could be settled. In the course of multidisciplinary work over the past ten years, plenty of new data has been collected, and it should no longer be assumed that the area was empty before the Swedish colonization. In order to better understand the settlement history in the zone between the coast and the inland, we studied the small island of Lohjansaari, which is situated in the large lake of Lohjanjarvi, approximately 62 km northwest of Helsinki.
   The evidence from archaeology, palaeoecology, and etymology suggests that sedentary settlement based on agriculture became established on the NE shore of Lake Lohjanjarvi by the beginning of the Viking Age at the latest, and the island of Lohjansaari has been used for resources from about AD 570 onwards. A major change towards an open cultural landscape was dated on the island of Lohjansaari to about AD 1095. In general, this dating agrees with former pollen analyses from the coastal areas, where the shift to a fully agrarian landscape becomes visible starting from the period between AD 940 and 1100. A change interpreted as a shift to a two-year crop rotation system took place from AD 1250 onwards. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Patient visits to the emergency department at a Norwegian university hospital: variations in patient gender and age, timing of visits, and patient acuity
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - ADMISSION
AB  - Background The patient visits to Norwegian emergency departments (EDs) have increased significantly over the last few years. A national evaluation revealed a lack of systematic activity control, resource management and quality improvement. This paper describes some variables in patient visits to an urban Norwegian university hospital.
   Methods The retrospective data were collected from a database (Akuttdatabasen) and included all patients admitted to the main ED at the St. Olav's University Hospital between 1 December 2010 and 1 December 2011.
   Results ED visits have increased by 44% over the last decade and show considerable timely variations. Almost 50% of the patients are older than 65 years of age. The rate of patients triaged with the highest acuity level was 11%, but only 1.3% of the patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The total admission rate was 89%.
   Conclusions The increase in ED visits to the St. Olav's Hospital in recent years follows the same trend as in other countries. The authors see a slightly higher percentage of high level acuity patients compared with international studies due the general practitioner's intended 'gatekeeper' function. The authors also found a high total admission rate and a low ICU admission rate compared with other countries. These differences cannot be explained solely by differences in the healthcare system in Norway. The cultural and traditional organisation of the Norwegian Health Care System needs to change and this creates an excellent opportunity to improve the competence by establishing emergency medicine as a specialty in Norway.

AB  - There is major risk that decoupling of EU income support for beef cattle will result in reduced beef production and a shortage of livestock for preservation of biodiversity in Swedish semi-natural pastures. Small, inefficient herds, high costs of grazing small, scattered pastures and expensive indoor wintering of beef cattle are important factors. However, decoupling of income support also for grain production and a conceivable abolition of the strict demand for replanting after clear cutting may create economic possibilities to re-establish large pasture-mosaics consisting of the present semi-natural pastures and arable land, and former pastures, which were afforested during the last century. Canadian experience and Swedish cost estimates suggest that large-scale beef production with outdoor wintering and grazing in such large pastures is economically sustainable even after decoupling. The risk of extinction of grassland species due to habitat isolation is lower in such mosaics than in small-scale pastures.

We address this issue in the INDO-NORDEN project through field studies addressing the climate impacts on the ecosystem carbon balance. Also, we will address several major issues relevant to Nordic agriculture under changing climatic conditions. INDO-NORDEN plans to develop biofuel production processes adopted in Estonia and India for enhancing biofuel yields.

KW  - MODEL
AB  - Preventive conservation is a significant approach for the conservation of built cultural heritage. This approach aims to prevent major deteriorations through monitoring and a planned maintenance programme. Although Visby, as one of the most important world heritage sites of Sweden, has many governmental organizations for conservation, none has a particular focus on maintenance. This paper examines the perspective of the habitants about the maintenance of their dwellings in the World Heritage Site of Visby. In this context, a survey is carried out to determine the main tendency of the habitants regarding the maintenance of historic buildings inside the city walls. Thus, the survey requires not only quantitative methods based on statistical data, but also qualitative methods based on interpretative data. The questionnaire conducted with the owners and tenants is the primary data collection tool. Both the owners and the tenants agree with the necessity of a non-governmental organisation in Visby to provide advice on maintenance. Maintenance and regular monitoring prevent costlier and large-scale repairs and are essential to retaining the cultural significance of Visby. This study can be helpful for adopting the community's opinion to the regular maintenance programme and promoting cooperation between non-profit organizations and governmental organizations in cultural heritage.

AB  - This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new, green industries from emerging by studying the rise and fall of the Norwegian advanced biofuel sector. It investigates three competing explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to develop a vibrant industry within this field: (i) the petroleum industry acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies - Borregaard (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo (biodiesel) - and uses their success and eventual failure as a key indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation system within this field. The article finds that the advanced biofuel companies were hampered mostly by inconsistent and unpredictable government incentives, and concludes that the third explanation best accounts for Norway's limited success in advanced biofuels.

AB  - Norway's tradition and expertise on underground works is of long standing. So much so that up to the present 800 road tunnels have been built in order to provide good communications, overcoming serious difficulties due to the landscape (mountains and fjords) and a severe climate. The 24.5 km. long Laerdal-Aurland tunnel, currently under construction: will become by the I:urn of the century the longest road tunnel worldwide. Because of this leading position, Norway is increasingly concerned about factors such as driving quality, comfort and safety on road tunnels and their relationship with functional and aesthetic design. This is the main target of the Project shown in this Paper.

AB  - Sustainable freight distribution is of growing interest for many local authorities in urban areas. Numerous policy measures on urban freight transport have been taken throughout Europe during the last decade. This paper presents the results of a study on the state of urban freight transport policies and planning among Swedish local authorities. Results are compared with existing research in the European context in order to find possible links between the freight transport awareness and the successes or failures of measures addressing urban freight transport issues. A questionnaire sent to all Swedish municipalities was combined with a literature study, to map the state of policy and planning within the freight transport as well as the knowledge and awareness of the area. The importance of adequate knowledge and personnel resources in municipalities as well as communication, information dissemination and knowledge exchange is discussed. The empirical data confirm the lack of coordination, sufficient resources and effective knowledge transfer among stakeholders in urban freight transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lake habitat alteration is a major stressor for lakes worldwide, and physical habitat alteration is likely the biggest threat to aquatic ecosystems, exceeding all other anthropogenic pressures. This study sought to elucidate which group of variables was the most important for describing Swedish macroinvertebrate community structure: trophic status, substrate variables or riparian variables. We also investigated what influence each of these groups of variables has on the other. The impact of large scale land use patterns was also investigated, to determine if macroinvertebrates responded differently in two different catchment land use types: impaired and unimpaired. Partial canonical ordination analysis showed that substrate variables were the most important for describing macroinvertebrate community variation in both catchment land use classes, followed by riparian descriptors, with the trophic signal only becoming clear when lakes were more strongly stratified for coarseness of substrate. This trophic effect was only evident in the impaired lakes, as the trophic gradient was much shorter in the lakes with an unimpaired catchment. Our results suggest that trophic effects on benthic invertebrates are nested within substrate habitat effects, and were masked by local habitat heterogeneity. This indicates that, at least in the Swedish situation, greater care needs to be taken in stratifying the substrate sampled in order to see this nutrient pressure-macroinvertebrate response relationship. The macroinvertebrate community composition was also responding to changes in riparian vegetation, specifically the presence of riparian trees and canopy cover. These variables, or lack of, are possible proxies for anthropogenic alteration of lake shores. Therefore, although macroinvertebrates may not be strong indicators of trophic pressure in all cases or habitats, they may be useful indicators for other anthropogenic pressures (e.g. hydromorphology) on lake shores.

AB  - Objective: Sleep is pivotal to health, wellbeing and functioning in daily life, but sleep difficulties are common and may be affected by modifiable qualities in the residential surrounding environment, in terms of greenspace. However, population-based studies on individual-level greenspace and sleep are limited. The objective of the current study was thus to investigate prospective associations between fine-grained individual-level residential greenspace and sleep, and moderating effects of life style (physical activity, work status) and sex, in a nationwide population-based Swedish cohort. Methods: Participants of the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH)-a population-based sample of adults in Sweden-were studied during 2014-2018 (19,375 individuals; 43,062 observations). Resi-dential greenspace land cover, and coherent green area size, were assessed via high resolution geographic in-formation systems, at 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 m buffers around residences. Prospective greenspace and sleep associations were assessed via multilevel general linear models, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic (in-dividual and neighborhood), life style and urban factors.Results: Higher greenspace availability in the immediate residential surroundings (50 m and 100 m buffer zones) was associated with less sleep difficulties, even after adjustment for confounders. Greenspace effects were generally greater among non-working individuals. Among the physically active, and among non-working, greenspace and green area size further away from home (300, 500 and 1000 m, i.e. dependent on mobility) were also associated with less sleep difficulties.Conclusions: Residential greenspace in the immediate residential surroundings is associated with significantly less sleep difficulties. Greenspace further away from home was associated with better sleep especially among the physically active, and non-working individuals. The results highlight the importance of greenspace in the im-mediate residential-surrounding environment for sleep, and the need to integrate health and environmental policies, urban planning and greening.

AB  - Results-oriented payment approaches are a means to deliver ecological results in agri-environment schemes. The results-based approach requires that farmers understand the meaning of the expected ecological results, and the approach and goals should be culturally acceptable. We interviewed 20 farmers in Finland about a hypothetical results-based payment scheme for biodiversity conservation that builds on an existing grassland fallow scheme. We explored i) how the 'managing for nature values' approach fits with 'good farming' ideal, ii) whether farmers would be able to operationalize ecological results, for which they would be rewarded, and iii) whether the results-based payment approach enhances or dilutes the current 'good farmer' ideal held by the farmers. We used 'good farming', cultural scripts, and the visibility of nature to farmers to explore these questions. The 'tidy farm' cultural script dominated, but farmers also described their farms as having space for non production elements. Visibility of nature to farmers varied, field visits with farmer and researchers together resulted in increased enthusiasm for farmers seeing biodiversity as an outcome that they can produce. The grassland fallow fits farmers' conceptualisations of 'good farming', and the results-based payment approach is culturally acceptable. Farmers' activities show nature values have a place in their conceptualisation of 'good farming'. We identified four categories of farmers based on their integration of ecological results into farming. These are nature values: 1) central to farmer thinking, 2) well-integrated, 3) viewed positively, but with limited actions and, 4) mainly absent.

AB  - In many arable soils, earthworms form the key component of the soil animal community and greatly contribute to soil quality. Our goal was to identify variables that can explain the variation of earthworm communities across Finnish arable fields by focusing on both regional aspects, such as climate and inherent soil properties, and local aspects, such as field management practices and field margins. We sampled the earthworms during the autumn of 2004 and 2005 at 53 sites of cultivated fields and margins, distributed to 11 localities ranging from the southern parts of Finland to the Arctic Circle. Simultaneously, information was collected on topsoil properties, cultivation history, and climatic factors. We found that soil type was by far the best regional variable to explain the variation in total earthworm density, the density being highest in medium coarse soils, i.e., silts and very fine sands. However, soil type had a significant interaction with soil C:N ratio. After accounting for the effect of soil type, no clear geographical trends remained in the regional variation, except that coastal areas with thin snow cover and deep frost had lower earthworm density than inland areas with deep snow cover and shallow frost. Of the local variables, tillage frequency, grazing, and field margins were the most influential. Frequent tillage led to earthworm communities heavily dominated by endogeic species, while grazed pastures had more than three times the earthworm biomass in comparison to non-grazed fields. Field margins harbored over twice the density and almost double the number of species in comparison to the adjacent cultivated fields, and eight of the nine species had wider regional distribution in the margins than in the fields. Inside the fields, species richness tended to decrease gradually with increasing distance to the margin. Our results suggest that, while soil texture and climatic factors set the general limits to earthworm communities in Finnish arable soils, field management practices can override these limits at the local scale. Cultivation in general simplifies the earthworm community, and this is particularly clear in the fields that are frequently tilled, whereas pastures and field margins seem to effectively preserve the biomass and diversity of earthworms.

AB  - A further growth in the Norwegian aquaculture industry might potentially be hampered by the conclusion that it is not environmentally sustainable. As direct measurements of the lice induced mortality on wild salmonids are impossible, the management is based on a set of high-quality and well-documented sustainability indicators. These indicators combine observations from the national Norwegian salmon lice monitoring programme with salmon lice models. Here, we have documented the quality of one of these models used to identify areas where the impact from farmed to wild salmonids is over the prescribed limit. The Hardangerfjord area has been used as a test area, but the model is general and, therefore, suitable for the rest of the coast. It is shown that the model system is robust and also can be used to test whether new knowledge gained from laboratory experiments improves the model. New findings on salmon lice behaviour at low salinities have been incorporated and the new model, consisting of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model coupled with an individual-based salmon lice model and forced with realistic input of salmon lice larvae from aquaculture farms, represents the best realization of the local potential infestation pressure on wild fish.

This paper sets up a theoretical framework to extend its understanding by drawing on ethics and political constructions of responsibility at their intersection with planning studies and SD debates. This is then applied to explore responsibility outlooks in planning practice in Sweden and England. It is argued that planning theory needs to further engage with the ethics of responsibility in planning but also with its politics, while the variety of responsibility landscapes in planning practice calls for a re-examination of responsibilities in planning for SD.

AB  - Agrivoltaic systems represent an intelligent solution combining electricity production from solar photovoltaic technology with agricultural production to avoid land use conflicts. Geographic Information System technologies can support the implementation and spread of agrivoltaic systems by identifying the most suitable areas using useful spatially explicit information concerning techno-agro-socio-economic criteria.In this study, we have developed a procedure to identify and classify suitable areas for agrivoltaic systems in Sweden. An Ordinal Priority Approach based multi-criteria decision-making algorithm is established to calculate the weights of the selected evaluation criteria through expert interviews. The land use data refers to the Corine Land Cover 2018 product.The results show that about 8.6% of the Swedish territory, approximately 38,485 km2, is suitable for installing agrivoltaic systems. Among this area, about 0.2% is classified as "excellent", about 15% as "very good", about 72% as "good", about 13% as "moderate", and about 0.1% as "poor". Most "excellent"-classified areas are in Kalmar, Skane, and Gotland. In contrast, most "very good" sites are in Skane, Kalmar, and center dot Ostergo center dot tland.By deploying vertically mounted agrivoltaic systems with bifacial photovoltaic modules, the total potential installed capacity for "excellent" areas is about 2.5 GWp, while for areas classified "excellent" and "very good" is about 221 GWp. The total "excellent" areas can potentially supply about 2.4 TWh of electricity against the electricity consumption in 2021 of about 143 TWh. On the other hand, the land classified as "excellent" and "very good" could potentially provide about 207 TWh. The County of Va center dot stra Go center dot taland shows the greatest po-tentials in terms of total potential electricity supply from agrivoltaic systems with about 227 TWh, followed by Skane with a total potential of 206 TWh.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical investigation on what behavioral information security governance factors drives the establishment of information security knowledge sharing in organizations. Data was collected from organizations located in different geographic regions of the world, and the amount of data collected from two countries namely, USA and Sweden allowed us to investigate if the effect of behavioral information security governance factors on the establishment of security knowledge sharing differs based on national culture.
   The study followed a mixed methods research design, wherein qualitative data was collected to both establish the study's research model and develop a survey instrument that was distributed to 578 information security executives. The results suggest that processes to coordinate implemented security knowledge sharing mechanisms have a major direct influence on the establishment of security knowledge sharing in organizations; the effect of organizational structure (e.g., centralized security function to develop and deploy uniform firm-wide policies, and use of steering committees to facilitate information security planning) is slightly weaker, while business-based information security management has no significant direct effect on security knowledge sharing. A mediation analysis revealed that the reason for the nonsignificant direct relation between business-based information security management and security knowledge sharing is the fully mediating effect of coordinating information security processes. Thus, the results disentangles the interrelated influences of behavioral information security governance factors on security knowledge sharing by showing that information security governance sets the platform to establish security knowledge sharing, and coordinating processes realize the effect of both the structure of the information security function and the alignment of information security management with business needs.
   A multigroup analysis identified that national culture had a significant moderating effect on the association between four of the six proposed relations. In Sweden which is seen as a less individualist, feminine country managers tend to focus their efforts on implementing controls that are aligned with business activities and employees' need; monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented controls, and assuring that the controls are not too obtrusive to the end-user. On the contrary, US organizations establish security knowledge sharing in their organization through formal arrangements and structures.
   These results imply that Swedish managers perceive it to be important to involve, or at least know how their employees cope with the decisions that have been made, thus favoring local participation in information security management, while US managers may feel the need to have more central control when running their information security function.
   The findings suggest that national culture should be taken into consideration in future studies in particular when investigating organizations operating in a global environment and understand how it affects behaviors and decision-making. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two fields of knowledge have been of special importance for the emergence of culture-led urban planning in Norwegian cities: one concerns the understanding of the potential of culture as an economic driving force in urban regeneration, while the other focuses on the emergence of the concept of the "creative class" and has drawn attention to the importance of competence and creativity in urban development. Despite clear connections between the two fields, it may appear that false connections have been made in regeneration strategies in a number of cities. Based on analyses of the culture-led urban strategy of Kristiansand, a small Norwegian city, these knowledge fields are discussed and it is claimed that there seems to be a fallacy in how they are treated in the culture-led urban strategy. The fallacy concerns the way that creativity is equated with culture and further how theories about the emergence of the creative class are equated with a culture industry approach to urban planning. Questions are raised about the potential of culture industry strategies and it is argued that the potential for growth in small cities may not be as great as the public debate and research conducted in large metropolises might suggest.

AB  - Geochemical profiles were analyzed from Cs-137-dated lake sediment cores near two sulfide mines (Ylojarvi and Haven) in SW Finland to obtain long-term records of elemental discharge to surface waters from the mine sites before, during and after mining. The results showed that both the intensity and chemical composition of mine water loading changed over time, and that pre-mining land uses (e.g. agriculture) also mobilized mining-associated elements in an area with mine potential. At Ylojarvi the sulfide-derived metal concentrations peaked during mining, but the lack of post-closure peaks probably resulted from the diffuse nature of the loading from the tailings facility. Major post-mining acid mine drainage (AMD) impact was detected at Haven, where the relative amounts of metals accumulated in sediments corresponded to the amounts of metals leached from the oxidized layer of the tailings. However, the temporal sequence of metal loading (Ni > Cu, S > Ag, As, Cd, Fe, Zn, V > Co, Mo) did not follow the classical sequence of sulfide weathering due to geochemical processes acting along the pathway to the receiving lake. The metal concentrations gradually decreased in recent sediments because of the progressive depletion of sulfides in the oxidized surface tailings, attenuating mechanisms such as adsorption by secondary Fe(III) minerals and increasing percolation of the contaminant plume into the groundwater. Nevertheless, the recent recorded values remain above the pre-anthropogenic levels, especially for copper. The examination of lake sediment cores allows assessment of the long-term evolution of metal and metalloid drainage from mining areas including pre-mining conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nutrient and pesticide pollution accompanying the intensive agriculture activities of the last fifty years has significantly impacted the Baltic Sea ecosystem in northern Europe. This research focused on identifying and describing the factors that may be promoting or inhibiting the implementation of environmental approaches that could reduce the negative impact of agriculture practices on the Baltic Sea. It is a case study of the ecological modernization of the agriculture industry in Skime, of southern Sweden, an area well known for its large scale and intensive agriculture practices. Studying the environmental contingent factors (eco-factors) has given some insight into why and how the implementation of certain environmental approaches may or may not be further adopted within the agriculture industry. This research has identified several important aspects that may positively encourage the further integration of environmental approaches within the agriculture industry: financial security, expanding knowledge, and local planning.

AB  - Near-shore areas face multiple stressors, effects of climate change, coastal construction and contamination. Although capping the seabed in these areas with mineral masses can reduce the impact of legacy contaminants in sediment, it can also result in the loss of flora and sessile fauna, both of which are vital components of near-shore ecosystems. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is essential to marine near-shore areas as it supports biodiversity and mitigates the effects of climate change. Therefore, it would be beneficial to modify the top layer of caps to facilitate the reestablishment of these ecosystems when capping near-shore areas. This study describes results from an in situ, six-month field experiment conducted to compare increase in leaf length over the growing season and survival of eelgrass transplanted in two commercially available substrates (Natural sand and Crushed stone) and indigenous sediment (i.e., indigenous control sediment) in a capping project in Horten Inner harbour, Norway. Similar leaf length increase was found in Natural sand and Indigenous control sediment, both significantly higher compared to Crushed stone substrate. Survival was highest in our case in the Indigenous control sediment (120 %), with no significant difference between Crushed stone (20 %) and Natural sand substrates (25 %). These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate substrate for successful seagrass restoration.

AB  - Species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe are a main target for conservation efforts, and alternative methods to the traditional management of mowing or grazing would be welcome due to the difficulties in maintaining traditional management practices. One such method proposed is burning of grassland vegetation during late winter or spring. To evaluate the effects of annual spring burning vs annual mowing on semi-natural grassland vegetation, we compared the frequency of species in eleven field experiments in southern Sweden after ca 14 years. Out of the 88 species analyzed, five were more frequent in burnt plots compared with mowed plots (Vicia cracca, Cirsium arvense, Urtica dioica, Galium verum, Convallaria majalis). In contrast, 37 species were significantly less frequent in burnt plots compared with mowed ones, those with the largest differences being Ranunculus acris, Briza media, Veronica chamaedrys, Festuca ovina, Plantago lanceolata and Anthoxanthum odoratum. Tall-grown species and those with preferences for N-rich soils increased in frequency under an annual spring-burn regime, compared with annual mowing, as did species producing larger amounts of nectar. Hence, although vegetation composition becomes more trivial with annual spring burns, there might be long-term benefits for nectar-feeding insects.

AB  - This study's purpose is to conceptualise the relationship between resilience and sustainability from a learning perspective. It asks how a community's first reactions to a crisis can indicate the possible future development of a destination's sustainability, and examines the resilience properties of elasticity, hysteresis and malleability in relation to single- and multiple-loop learning. Empirically, this study explores public discussions about tourism in northern Norway immediately before, and during the first months of, the COVID-19 crisis. Such discussions are investigated through a qualitative content analysis of articles from the regional newspaper. The findings identify a variety of perspectives among the participants to the discussions reported in the newspaper, including the coexistence of different views on tourism and sustainability and on responses to a crisis. This study frames the discussions in terms of elastic, hysteretic and malleable reactions, and illustrates three learning paths towards alternative weak and strong sustainable futures in a conceptual model. The originality of this study concerns a conceptualisation of the resilience - sustainability relationship as a set of learning paths that emphasises the dynamic and non-deterministic aspects of tourism development, aiming to evoke a sense of both responsibility and empowerment.

AB  - The article explores whether marine biodiversity mappings can contribute to the mapping of the material basis of Sami culture. Four different mapping practices are analysed in the article, all related to the seascape in the Lyngen fjord (Lyngenfjorden) in northern Norway. Initiatives undertaken by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries and the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) to map cod spawning grounds, and by the Sami Rights Commission (SRC) to map customary use of a fjord are compared with local fishing practices. Although the seascape was initially mapped to find spawning grounds (the IMR and the Directorate) and to record social practices (the Directorate and the SRC), the outcomes also express social relations between the mappers and the mapped materials. Whereas the mappings that included fishermen's relations with fishing grounds are compatible with each other, the marine scientists' mapping documented biodiversity independent of local relations with it. The author argues that the marine environment should be seen as expressing social relations between groups of people and certain materialities instead of as separated in natural and social layers. Thus, even though marine biodiversity mapping practices reveal biodiversity in Sami settlement areas, they inform little about the material basis of Sami culture.

AB  - Tardigrades occur worldwide and in a variety of ecosystems and habitats representing an important component of the micrometazoan biodiversity. Several studies documenting the occurrence of tardigrades in Sweden have been published since the first reports in early 1900, but no comprehensive summary of these studies have been published. We compiled the available information on recorded tardigrades from Sweden, using material from published studies and museum and university collections. In total, our review document 101 species of tardigrades that have been recorded from Sweden ( an updated checklist of tardigrades from Sweden will be available online), of which 14 species are new records for the country. The highest number of species was recorded in the northernmost province of Lappland and the more southern provinces of Uppland and Skane, while much lower species numbers are reported from the middle part of Sweden. This pattern probably represents biased sampling activities of biologists rather than real differences in biodiversity of tardigrades. In view of the few studies that have been made on tardigrade biodiversity in Sweden, the relatively high number of tardigrade species recorded, representing almost a tenth of the species recorded worldwide, indicates that many more species remain to be found. In this respect, more studies of the marine ecosystems along the Swedish west coast and the long Baltic Sea coastline would be of particular interest.

AB  - Many African countries such as Algeria, Angola, Ghana, Libya, and Nigeria have created Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) in order to ensure financial sustainability, overcome infrastructure deficits and deal with pro-cyclical expenditure associated with petroleum revenues. Clearly, some of these countries believe that by mirroring the 'Norwegian model', they could deal with a potential 'curse' associated with oil discovery and production. Indeed, 9 out of 14 functional African SWFs derive their source of funding from hydrocarbons. Specifically, these funds are aimed at cushioning governments during oil price fall; serve as an endowment for future generation, or for the development of specific areas or sectors. Generally, rules on the governance, investments and expenditure of these funds are drafted and implemented to minimize the chances of abuse. Despite this, returns are often low whilst most of these countries borrow at high interest rates. In addition, there are fund governance challenges in selected countries. This study provides an assessment of the performance of SWFs of Algeria, Angola, Ghana and Nigeria. A discussion of how SWFs are managed, the funding gap for energy transition and how SWFs can help fill this gap are documented. The study recommends that a cost -benefit analysis of SWFs strategies should be conducted before SWFs investment decisions are made.

AB  - Over the past two decades, project governance has attracted increasing attention from researchers and practitioners worldwide and has become an important research area of project management. However, an inclusive quantitative and systematic analysis of the state-of-the-art recently available research in this field is still missing. This study attempts to map the global research on project governance through a state-of-the-art review. A total of 285 bibliographic records were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database and analyzed by the visual analytic tool-CiteSpace. The results indicated that there has been an increasing research interest in project governance. The most productive and the most highly cited author in the area of project governance is Muller R., and most of the existing project governance research achievements are from Australia, China, USA, and Norway. By synthetically analyzing the keywords, future research might focus on governance of megaprojects and project success. Additionally, 9 knowledge domains of project governance were identified, including conceptual framework, public projects, governance structure, governance context, megaproject governance, contractual and relational governance, sustainability, portfolio governance, and project success. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by mapping the existing project governance research. It is particularly helpful to new and early-stage researchers who plan to do research on project governance, as it can provide them an overview of project governance research, including key authors, main institutions, hot topics, and knowledge domains. Moreover, the findings from the study are beneficial to industry practitioners as well, as they can help industry practitioners understand the latest development of governance theory and practice and thereby help them locate the best governance strategies for project management.

AB  - Policy mixes (i.e. the total structure of policy processes, strategies, and instruments) are complex constructs that can quickly become incoherent, inconsistent, and incomprehensive. This is amplified when the policy mix strives to meet multiple objectives simultaneously, such as in the case of large carnivore policy mixes. Building on Rogge and Reichardt's analytical framework for the analysis of policy mixes, we compare the policy mixes of Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany (specifically Saxony and Bavaria), and Spain (specifically Castilla y Leon). The study shows that the large carnivore policy mixes in the case countries show signs of lacking vertical and horizontal coherence in the design of policy processes, weak consistency between objectives and designated policy instruments, and, as a consequence, lacking comprehensiveness. We conclude that creating consistent, coherent, and comprehensive policy mixes that build on multiple objectives requires stepping away from sectorized policy development, toward a holistic, systemic approach, strong collaborative structures across policy boundaries and regions, the inclusion of diverse stakeholders, and constant care and attention to address all objectives simultaneously rather than in isolation.

AB  - The objective of this study is to examine the import dependency of domestic food and service sectors in Finland and produce indicators for measuring the import content of these sectors together with the import dependency of the inputs supplied into these sectors. Input-output analysis is utilised to provide the necessary information on the interdependencies and linkages between different industries for both goods and services in the Finnish economy. Primary agriculture, food processing, distribution and food service providers in Finland are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels concerning energy and chemical inputs, including high reliance on imported supplementary protein feed for livestock production. However, most of the inputs supplied to the Finnish food and service sectors are domestic because only 20% of the total output is dependent on imported goods, services, and capital goods. The rate of self-sufficiency in food supply is high in Finland, but international trade is essential to provide the necessary energy and chemical inputs needed for food production along with livestock's supplementary protein feed. Replacing fossil energy with sustainable renewable energy will reduce the dependence on Russia for energy supply and promoting human consumption of plant-based foods will reduce the demand for livestock feed.

AB  - Over the last decade, crowdfunding has become a major way to fund and develop creative projects. This is why regional governments in many European countries have begun to support crowdfunding platforms as providers of technology. Governments offer various kinds of support, including match-funding, which, as its name suggests, supplements crowdfunding campaigns with public monies. However, there is a dearth of academic research on cultural crowdfunding and public-private partnerships. This paper uses a qualitative methodology to come up with a conceptual model for governmental support and collaboration with cultural crowdfunding platforms. It also gives two case studies of public-private partnerships that support crowdfunding initiatives in Spain and Sweden. The lack of support and intervention mechanisms may suggest that regional and local governments still see crowdfunding as a marginal way of financing those cultural projects that cannot access other sources of funding.

AB  - The northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis L.) stock in the Skagerrak is shared by Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Although the fishery is regulated by an annual agreement between the EU and Norway, there are also national regulations as well as differences in fleet composition and shrimp markets. In early 2014, the World Wildlife Fund gave all Skagerrak shrimp a red light in their seafood consumer guide, which led to an extensive debate, especially in Sweden, about the sustainability of this fishery. The aim of this study was to quantify a set of indicators that together give a broad picture of the sustainability of the three fisheries to provide an objective basis for a discussion on needed measures. The different indicators concerned environmental, economic or social aspects of sustainability and were quantified per tonne of shrimp landed by each country in 2012. The Danish fishery was most efficient in terms of environmental and economic indicators, while the Swedish fishery provided most employment per tonne of shrimp landed. Fuel use in all fisheries was high, also when compared with other shrimp fisheries. Interesting patterns emerged, with smaller vessels being more fuel efficient than larger ones in Sweden and Norway, with the opposite trend in Denmark. The study also demonstrated major data gaps and differences between the countries in how data are collected and made available. Various improvement options in the areas data collection and publication, allocation of quotas and enforcement of regulations resulted. Product-oriented studies could be useful to follow-up performance of fisheries over time and to identify how to best utilize the Skagerrak shrimp stock. This could involve evaluating novel solutions in terms of technology and management, based on current and future scenarios aiming to maximize societal benefits generated from this limited resource, at minimized environmental impacts.

AB  - Coastal habitats provide a variety of benefits for citizens living in littoral countries. The economic value of changes in coastal habitats in the context of the implementation of the Baltic Sea Action Plan, targeting good ecological status by 2021, in two coastal sites was estimated using the choice experiment method. The selected aspects of marine ecosystem were described in conjunction with ecological changes modeled within the Finnish-Swedish archipelago and the Lithuanian coast The benefits for Finns, Swedes, and Lithuanians for changes in the adjacent coastal site were estimated with the conditional logit and random parameters logit models accounting for preference heterogeneity. The willingness to pay estimates for healthy perennial vegetation, protection of currently pristine areas, and size of fish stocks differed significantly between populations. The transfer errors ranging from 40%, when transferring the estimates for the same coastal site between populations, to 400%, when transferring between both sites and populations, underline careful consideration in value transfers.

AB  - The article deals with the 'total defense >> concept considering it to be part of Swe-den's strategic culture and provides an overview of how this concept defines Sweden's ap-proach towards the defense cooperation within the EU. 'Total defence >> remains staple in the Swedish defence planning and the perception of risks to national security, but has not yet received sufficient attention from Russian researchers. The announced restoration of the effective total defense system potentially comparable to that of the period of bipolar con-frontation is associated with significant difficulties due to the gradual reduction in defense spending after the end of the Cold War and the decentralization of the national crisis prepar-edness structures which was initiated in the early 2000s. The total defense itself also reveals tensions between the demands for consolidation and centralized decision-making and the liberal, open nature of the Swedish society and national economy, as well as the principles of responsibility, subsidiarity and similarity that underline the present Swedish emergency response system. The total defense, is, therefore, regarded as an attempt at creating an ef-fective crisis preparedness system that would function successfully in a democratic society, both under the conditions of peace and potential armed conflict, without the need to de-clare an emergency and endow individual bodies or a selected group of individuals with exclusive powers. The Swedish strategic culture, therefore, stipulates that it is important not only to resolve a crisis effectively, but also to do so in a way which would not endanger the regular functioning of political institutions and the rule of law. Within the EU Sweden has earned credit for developing civilian or non-military elements of crisis management, while 'more hardware >> defense cooperation within PESCO and the European Defense Fund is defined by the pragmatic economic interests of Swedish defense companies rather than by strategic considerations. The Swedish Experience with 'total defence >> will continue to face the same dilemma - the need to rebuild a robust and self-reliant national defence while preserving the liberal principles in politics as well as in economy.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient flows exceed the planetary boundaries. The boundaries and the current excesses vary spatially. Such variations have both an ecological and a social facet. We explored the spatial variation using a bottom-up approach. The local critical boundaries were determined through the current or accumulated flow of the preceding five years before the planetary boundary criteria were met. Finland and Ethiopia served as cases with contrasting ecology and wealth. The variation in excess depends on historical global inequities in the access to nutrients. Globally, the accumulated use per capita is 2300 kg reactive nitrogen (N-r) and 200 kg phosphorus (P). For Finland, the accumulated use per capita is 3400 kg N-r and 690 kg P, whereas for Ethiopia, it is 26 kg N-r and 12 kg P. The critical N boundary in Finland is currently exceeded by 40 kg cap(-1) a(-1) and the accumulated excess is 65 kg cap(-1) a(-1), while the global current excess is 24 kg cap(-1) a(-1) and there is space in Ethiopia to increase even the accumulated flow. The critical P boundary is exceeded in Finland and (although less so) in Ethiopia, but for contrary reasons: (1) the excessive past inflow to the agrifood system in Finland and (2) the excessive outflow from the agrifood system triggered by deficits in inflow and waste management in Ethiopia. The critical boundaries set by Finnish marine systems are lower and those set by freshwaters are higher than the planetary boundaries downscaled per capita. The shift to dominance of internal loading in watercourses represents a tipping point. We conclude that food security within the safe boundaries requires global redistribution of nutrients in residues, soils and sediments and of rights to use nutrients. Bottom-up assessments reveal local dynamics that shed new light on the relevant boundary criteria and on estimates and remedies.

AB  - Both policymakers and the technology industry need to do more to combat the ever-growing demand for data and its associated energy impacts. In this study, based on novel corporate data, expert interviews, focus groups with members of the public, extensive site visits across Greenland, Iceland and Norway and a literature review, we look at the energy and climate impacts of existing and proposed datacenters, both quantitatively and in terms of stakeholder and public perceptions. The paper examines datacenter management and sustainability practices in the Nordic region. It explores what community impacts occur, and how communities manage conflicting objectives. It investigates the technical and policy options that can make datacenters more sustainable and/or lower-carbon and it explores associated stakeholder and public views in the three countries. In exploring these themes, our study examines the shifting energy governance of datacenters, including patterns of electricity consumption and cooling but also circular economy operations and power densities. We also analyze a series of 40 solutions for eco-friendly design or green datacenter management across the entire lifecycle. We conclude with implications for energy and climate policy as well as future research.

AB  - We documented the loss of brown bear (Ursus arctos) cubs-of-die-year (cubs) in 2 Swedish populations for 11 years in the north and 12 years in the south, and made spatial and temporal comparisons to examine whether nutritional, social (sexually selected infanticide), or den disturbance factors best explained the observed variation. Annual cub loss was 0.04 (n = 78) in the north and 0.35 (n = 126) in the south. The loss of cubs at both levels of comparison was best explained by social factors. Disturbance was only evaluated in the south and explained significant variation. In the north, few adult males died and 3 adult males lost early in the study there were not replaced for many years, presumably due to little immigration of new males. Immigration was probably low due to high illegal mortality around the study area and lack of bear habitat on one side of the study area. In the south, 5 times as many males died annually, and in years with recorded adult male mortality, an average of 20% of the adult males died. The number of adult males remained stable, presumably due to immigration by new males. Illegal mortality appeared to be less in the south, and the study area was surrounded by bear habitat. Number of adult males dying in cub areas (the composite area of all radiomarked females with cubs) 2 years previously was correlated negatively with cub survival in the south. In the north, no factors correlated with temporal patterns of cub loss, but loss of adult males 1-2 years previously was the best variable we tested. We suggest that immigrating males kill cubs, as predicted by the sexually selected infanticide hypothesis. Some other studies have yielded similar results. We recommend that managers assume that loss of adult male bears is depensatory until this question is adequately resolved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine how the competitive advantage on international markets based on sustainable production is reflected in the pricing behavior of farmed fish, using Norwegian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as an example. The salmon is widely consumed and highly traded due to the rapid development of aquaculture. Norway, which has been successful in regulating and innovating for sustainable aquaculture, accounts for more than half of world production. A model dealing with pass-through of exchange rates and tariff rates based on the exporter's profit maximization was applied to 28 major countries importing from Norway, using yearly panel data for 2000-2016. Significant evidence of price discrimination was observed in Asian countries where Norway has a high market share, such as China, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. This implies that the market structure of imperfect competition played a major role, suggesting the need to diversify imports to transform the market structure in favor of consumers in Asian countries. Research on the pricing behavior of fisheries products, including cultured fish, is limited in international trade. This paper addresses the gap by applying the pass-through model with changes in tariff rate as well as exchange rate.

AB  - Food production processes may have both positive and negative environmental sustainability impacts. This makes decision-making challenging in the transition towards more sustainable food production systems. In this paper, a new method for presenting environmental impacts in the context of planetary boundaries is demonstrated. This will help food and agricultural producers compare the magnitudes of various environmental impacts.
   The environmental sustainability impacts of an organic sheep farm in the boreal climate zone in Finland are studied herein first using a life cycle assessment method. The results are then normalized and presented in a planetary boundary framework to ascertain the extent of different environmental impacts.
   The results show that in the planetary boundary context, there are positive impacts of sheep grazing on biosphere integrity (genetic diversity) and biogeochemical flows and negative impacts on climate change, land use or freshwater use. Magnitudes of the impacts greatly dependent on the assumptions made especially regarding biosphere integrity impacts. In the future, it is crucial that decision-making be based on the evaluation of various environmental impacts and that the focus be more on complex sustainability thinking, rather than on one single environmental impact.
   This research demonstrates that results from a life cycle assessment can be modified and presented in a planetary boundaries context. A planetary boundary framework approach similar to that proposed herein could be further used to identify different environmental sustainability perspectives and to help one better recognize the multifunctional aspects of the ecosystem processes.

AB  - Invasive alien species threaten biodiversity with domestic gardens acting as a major pathway for the introduction of alien species. Even though the Nordic region is not currently a hotspot for biological invasions, the number of invasions in the Nordic area has been predicted to increase due to climate change. Given a time lag between introduction and invasion, many non-invasive horticultural alien species already introduced into gardens may become invasive in the future. This study aimed to identify the communication needs of Swedish garden owners regarding their management of invasive alien species. A survey among domestic garden owners, informed by topic specialists and local area experts, and interviews with garden owners were conducted in three different bioclimatic areas in a latitudinal gradient across Sweden. The questions targeted invasive alien species and their relations to biodiversity loss and climate change, as well as measures taken to control these species. Analysing the survey data collected in relation to measures taken to control invasive species, Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) modelling was used to identify geographically varying communication needs of the domestic garden owners. In all study areas, the garden owners' measures taken to control invasive alien species were correlated with their strength of beliefs in having experienced local biodiversity loss. A majority of the garden owners were, moreover, uncertain about the impact of climate change on the invasiveness of alien species. In addition, the garden owners' capacity for identifying invasive alien species was often in need of improvement, in particular with respect to the species Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica and Rosa rugosa. The results suggest that the evidence-based guidelines for effective communications we developed, have the potential to help communicators meet the local communication needs of garden owners across Sweden, in relation to the management of invasive alien garden species.

AB  - To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.

AB  - Geological hazards may threaten human life, may result in serious property damage, and may significantly influence normal development of biota. They are caused by natural endogenic and exogenic driving forces or generated by anthropogenic activities. An interaction of geological processes and intense anthropogenic activities, e.g., construction of buildings, harbors, oil and gas pipelines, hydroengineering facilities, and land reclamation, has resulted in hazard potential, especially for the densely populated areas of the Russian Baltic coastal zone. These hazards may in addition be harmful for the sensitive ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Mapping and assessment of the geological hazard potential should be the main objectives of an integrated management program for the protection of coastal zones. This study documents the first step in that process for the Russian sector of the Baltic Sea and its coastal zone. A major part of endogenic hazard potential both in the Kaliningrad area and in the eastern Gulf of Finland remains at low- or medium-risk levels, but analysis of the recent environmental conditions at the seabed of the Russian sector of the Baltic Sea and, especially, within its coastal zone shows that during the last years the activity of exogenic geological processes has increased significantly. The highest risk within both studied areas has been caused by coastal and bottom erosion. In addition, in shallow area near the shore bottom of the eastern Gulf of Finland, "avalanche" sedimentation and sediment pollution can produce hazardous situations as well.

AB  - Experiencing nature and enjoying natural amenities have long been identified as key motives for rural second home tourism. However, the more people travel and spend time in the natural environment, the more it is disturbed by their actions and activities. In this paper, we examine how people perceive the environmental impacts of rural second home tourism and how they justify their views. The study focuses on Finland where rural second homes are widespread. Analysis is based on a questionnaire survey conducted among Finns in 2012 (n = 1189). Responses from different groups of respondents (second home owners, regular users of second homes and non-users) are quantitatively and qualitatively analysed. The results indicate that the Finnish respondents generally think that second home tourism poses some degree of harmful environmental impacts. However, it is the second home owners who are least worried about these environmental impacts. They generally justify their opinions using a "place-related" perspective, that is, by referring to their own experiences and actions at the cottage site. In contrast, the non-users see environmental impacts more often from a broader perspective by referring to the wider environmental interconnections with second home tourism. In our discussion, we introduce the notions of place-based (relative) and phenomenon-based (relational) environmental perceptions as a potential framework for future research on this topic. In mitigating the increasing environmental impacts of second home tourism, understanding the environmental perceptions and awareness of second home owners and users is crucial to be successful in mobilising sustainable options and environmental governance.

AB  - This article discusses the three Finnish city names Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa, and the urban discourses that surround them. The study reveals patterns of socio-spatial differentiation by examining what meanings people attach to these capital region cities and investigating how these meanings are expressed in online discourses. Using the methodological approach of corpus-assisted onomastics (CAO), this study incorporates onomastics, geographical information systems (GIS), and corpus linguistics. This interdisciplinary research also examines how corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) and GIS can be combined to reveal and visualize the contextual information and discursive patterns of toponyms. For this investigation, a data set of 2.7 billion words was collected from the Suomi24 Corpus, one of the biggest discussion fora in Finland. The use of social media corpus as a data source increases the authenticity of this research, as the data was not collected specifically for this study. The analysis reveals that the most frequent digital discourses about the cities refer to places and directions, housing, and mobility. The occurrences differ quantitatively and qualitatively between each city. This paper paves the way for future onomastic studies to research actual name usage using this new methodology. Knowledge gained from such research may not only enrich the field of onomastics, but also facilitate more socially sustainable urban planning.

AB  - Large carnivores are ecologically important, but their behaviour frequently put them in conflict with humans. I suggest that a spatial co-occurrence of suitable habitat and relatively poor socioeconomic conditions in rural areas may contribute to inflated human-carnivore conflict. Here, I test if there is potential for such an explanation for the human-wolf conflict in Sweden, a conflict that is arguably not congruent with the costs and damages imposed by the wolf population. I found negative correlations between wolf habitat suitability within Swedish municipalities and indicators of their relative socioeconomic conditions. I argue that geographic socioeconomic inequality may contribute to the Swedish human-wolf conflict, partly by the use of wolves as symbols for socioeconomic dissent and partly by using them as scapegoats for socioeconomic conditions. Therefore, regional policies aimed at alleviating geographic socioeconomic inequities may create a more favourable environment for solving the human-wolf conflict in Sweden.

AB  - Norwegian sheep production is based on the use of free outfield grazing resources in the mountains and forests in summer. Lamb prices are strongest at the beginning of the slaughter season in August and then begin to gradually decline, reaching a lower plateau in mid-October. Seasonal pricing provides incentives to get slaughter lambs to market early. The objective of this study was to examine how outfield summer pasture quality, time of collection from the outfields, and inclusion of annual forage crops in the diet of finishing lambs influence optimal farm plans and profitability in Norwegian forage-based sheep production systems at varying levels of farmland availability (varying from 15 to 25 ha with 20 ha as the basis). A linear programming model was developed for sheep production systems in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway. Input-output relationships incorporated into the model included data from field experiments with grasses for annual and perennial use, observed performance of lambs and ewes at pastures, a feed planning tool for the indoor season, and expert judgements. The model maximised total gross margin of farms with a housing capacity of 200 ewes. The results suggested that with more land available, drafting older and heavier lambs for slaughter was profitable. The lighter lambs at weaning were usually drafted much later and at the same or heavier carcass weights than the heavy lambs at weaning because of seasonal pricing. Higher quality outfield summer pastures increased lamb live weights at weaning. Annual profits improved considerably with rich summer pastures compared to poor summer pastures. Early collection was always less profitable than normal time of collection because greater prices for lambs sold could not offset losses from the additional feed costs incurred and a possibly smaller flock. Speeding up the growth rate of finishing lambs by offering annual forage crops in addition to grazed grass was usually more profitable than grass only. Only for rich summer pastures and normal time of collection at low land availability was use of annual forage crops unprofitable.

AB  - The core aim of the present study is to examine cultural differences in risk perception and attitudes towards traffic safety and risk, taking behaviour in the Norwegian and the Ghanaian public. An additional aim is to discuss the applicability of various traffic measures, suited for low and middle income countries in Africa.
   Sample: The results of the present study are based on two self-completion questionnaire surveys carried out in February and March 2006. The first was a representative sample of the Norwegian public above 18 years of age (N = 247). The second was a stratified sample of Ghanaian respondents (N = 299). In Ghana the data was collected in Accra and Cape Coast.
   The results showed that there is potential for further improvement of safety attitudes and risk behaviour among Ghanaians as well as Norwegians. There were also differences in the respondents' evaluation of attitudes, risk perception and behaviour. Perceived risk and attitudes also significantly predicted risk behaviour and accidents/collisions. The implications of these results for traffic safety will be discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A large share of future European hydropower projects will be run-of-the-river schemes. To understand the potential for RoR hydropower development and modernization of the technology as an opportunity for sustainable decentralization, we use the Q-methodology to compare public values about RoR hydropower in German, Portuguese and Swedish case studies. Four perspectives on the importance of RoR hydropower emerged from our analysis: (i) maintain regional control, (ii) fight climate change, (iii) promote citizen well-being and (iv) protect natural ecosystems. Strong preferences for regional control imply RoR should be managed as distributed generation rather than viewed as part of a centralized, national system like traditional large-scale reservoir hydropower. Based on the importance of citizen well-being and ecological measures, operators could adopt strategies such as river widening and the reconstruction of secondary channels, which help control floods, create recreational opportunities as well as enhance ecological habilitation and biodiversity. Additionally, policymakers could support rigorous monitoring programs to assess the ecological impact of RoR.

TI  - WILD C-4 PLANTS IN GERMANY AND SWEDEN - A COMPILATION IN VIEW BY CLIMATE-CHANGE
T2  - ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA  - German
AB  - 48 species of wild C-4 plants are listed for Germany and Sweden. The difference in occurence of all species found (Germany: 47; Sweden: 23) and for the indigenous species (Germany: 9; Sweden: 3) is attributed to the temperature gradient. The most of the C-4 plants in either country occur as a result of anthropogenic influencies, in particular agriculture and industry. Only few species have been able to establish themselves in existing natural plant communities. One of the few examples is the Polygono-Chenopodietum plant society in the valleys of southern and central Germany.
   Analysis of the ecological characteristics revealed that C-4 plants are mostly annual herbs and adapted to high nutrient concentrations in soils. They are frequently found in saline areas, prefer well lit as well as maritime and climatically favoured locations. Most of the species are highly competitive. The changes in their spatial distributions presently observed, are closely connected to changes in land use efficiency.
   The shifting to the North of cultivated areas as a consequence of global climate change combined with the increased probability of extreme weather events may lead to a further spread of those C-4 species which are adapted. This effect is opposing the effect of increased CO2-concentrations which will favour C-3 plants.

AB  - Spatial planning conducted by the local authorities has been identified as a key part of shaping carbon-neutral societies. Nevertheless, the question of whether local authorities are building their institutional capacity for integrating climate change mitigation aspects into spatial planning remains under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap while also analysing the role of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in facilitating organisational learning. The methods employed were a longitudinal document analysis of Comprehensive Plans belonging to eight municipalities in Stockholm County, complemented by a focus group interview. A significant difference was identified, as the recently adopted Comprehensive Plans included more strategies for climate change mitigation and, to a greater extent, linked these strategies to reduced climate impact or energy efficiency than previously adopted Comprehensive Plans. However, numerous additional strategies could have been given further consideration in each studied Comprehensive Plan. Thus, this calls for more continuous and cyclical comprehensive planning processes to facilitate capacity building, primarily by being a vehicle for mobilising political support. Lastly, the findings indicate that SEA can lead to organisational learning of both single-loop and double-loop nature, where the latter can enable SEA to shape the planning process in a more profound and sustainability-oriented manner.

AB  - This paper presents empirical data from a comparison of the management strategies governing marine angling tourism (MAT) in Norway and Iceland. Marine angling tourism has been steadily growing in popularity in the coastal fjord communities of Norway and Iceland over the last several years, and as regulations stand now, MAT is consumptive wildlife tourism, dependent on the extraction of living marine resources. Iceland's management system is based on the individual transferable quota (ITQ) and total allowable catch (TAC) management policies, designed for the commercial fishing fleet. These policies can be considered too restrictive with regard to laws and regulations for the appropriate management of MAT; however, Iceland found a way to compensate for this through active stakeholder participation which includes mutual and open communication, and actively engaging feedback loops which empirically demonstrates how interactive governance could work in practice. Norway's system gives more freedom to tourists, and the consequences of this impact both the vulnerable fjord stocks and the local communities. Findings suggest that the environmental and socio-cultural sustainability of MAT requires a complex socio-ecological systems perspective, with interactive governance strategies leading management policies. Sustainability requires that a management strategy not only focus on the economic aspects; priority must also be given to minimizing multi-stakeholder conflicts and providing sufficient resource data to protect vulnerable fish stocks.

AB  - In European forests, plants, fungi and invertebrates have been proposed as indicator species for assessing conservation value at the stand scale. To cover larger spatial scales, wide-ranging vertebrates could be added to that set of species. For resident forest birds, we (1) explored whether the occurrence of some species could be used to indicate high species richness and abundances, and (2) compared the results among four regions in the Baltic Sea drainage basin with a common species pool but different forest management intensities and varying proportions of deciduous and coniferous trees (south-central and southern Sweden, south-central Lithuania and northeastern Poland). Assemblages of deciduous forest birds in 100-ha landscape units were generally nested, suggesting that species richness within that group may be predicted based on the presence of a few species. Birds of coniferous forests, however, showed poorer conformity to nestedness in Sweden. Specialised species such as the middle spotted (Dendrocopos medius) and lesser spotted woodpeckers (D. minor) in deciduous forest and the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) in coniferous forest generally figured among the best indicators. In deciduous forest, there was high cross-regional consistency in the identity of the best indicators. Moreover, the sites where the best indicator was present also harboured higher relative abundances of most background species. For coniferous forest, however, such a relationship was not found. We conclude that an indicator species approach may be useful for resident birds of deciduous forests in hemiboreal Europe, emphasising that it should constitute one of many complementary tools for conservation management.

AB  - The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We deter-mined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects meta-communities across multiple major cities. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In many Central European areas, forests have been altered by century-long management practices, including grazing with domestic ungulates and litter harvesting. During the last century, most of these agro-forestry practices have been abandoned in many regions of Switzerland. As a consequence, stand density has increased, leading to higher competition for resources among trees, and particularly between overstory trees and understory vegetation. Only few studies investigated the effects of understory on the growth and physiology of overstory trees.
   We conducted an understory removal experiment at a xeric Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in an inner Alpine valley of Switzerland over a period of 5 years and compared data of soil temperature and water content, needle and shoot length, and radial growth and sap flow.
   The removal of the understory increased soil temperature as well as soil water content at 5 to 60 cm soil depth, and led to a 4.6-fold higher mean annual radial growth and significantly longer needles and shoots. The removal of the understory further decreased tree water deficit and increased sap flow.
   We conclude that reduced competition for soil water after removal of the understory vegetation was the primary cause of the increased performance of the overstory trees since light was not a limiting factor already before the understory removal. Thus, increases in understory density due to altered forest management may have exacerbated observed drought-induced decline processes. Therefore, our study demonstrates the need for a careful disentangling of climate and land-use change processes as they may evolve in parallel and potentially intensify their impact on the ecosystems. In contrast, the findings suggest decreasing understory density as a suitable management practice to increase overstory tree growth and vigour, and hence reduce mortality risk for a species like Scots pine in a drought-prone environment.

AB  - The article provides insight into the military-political prerequisites for deepening cooperation between Germany and Sweden. The author explores the increasing role of the Kingdom of Sweden in German foreign policy planning (primarily in the sphere of international security) since the mid 2010's. The article also highlights the issues of multilateral negotiating platforms with joint participation, the coordination between Germany and Sweden in the sphere of the armed conflicts resolution in the unstable African and Asian states (particularly in Mali). It is concluded that Germany is interested in Sweden to stay formally outside NATO. The aauthor discusses the features and problems of bilateral trade-economic cooperation, including the questions of military-technical cooperation. The argues that the potential Swedish pivot to the USA is undesirable for Germany in terms of ensuring its growing ambitions as a power within the Euro-Atlantic regional subsystem and at the global level.

AB  - Marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a relatively new industry where breeding programs have led to rapid genetic change in the captive populations that were built up alongside conspecific wild individuals. Throughout its 50-years history, marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon has been associated with escapes, and studies have shown that escapees may enter rivers, spawn successfully, and this may lead to farmed-to-wild genetic introgression and maladaptation in wild populations. Yet, an open question is what factors can best explain the variability in the proportion of farmed escapees in wild populations, and when present, which additional factors lead to introgression. Here, we combine two large-scale data sets from monitoring escaped farmed salmon and introgression in Norwegian rivers between 2006 and 2018 to model how anthropogenic, environmental, and population factors influence proportion of escapees and level of introgression. We found that increasing farming intensity and river discharge increase the expected proportions of escaped farmed salmon in rivers, whereas a larger wild salmon population size reduces the expected proportion of escapees despite increasing the expected absolute numbers of escaped farmed salmon. On a large scale, introgression is primarily a function of proportions of escaped farmed salmon, and only to a minor extent a function of local environmental factors or salmon population characteristics. This suggests that as long as salmon aquaculture is based on technologies where non-sterile fish can escape, all anadromous wild Atlantic salmon populations are at risk. Large marine protected areas without salmon aquaculture may slow down the rate of intrusion and introgression by increasing the distance between intensive aquaculture and wild populations.

AB  - The study conceptualizes economic forest sustainability as "the forest-related income and economic well-being sustained over time" and then compares Lithuania and Sweden at different scales. Sweden adopts a holistic perspective of the forest sector, where forestry and forest industries are perceived as a well-integrated economic branch. Forestry is expected to deliver raw material to forest industries, at the same time creating good preconditions for profitable forest management. Forest owners are given large freedom to act according to market signals and their own household needs, while the resulting intensive forest management cumulatively leads to a significant contribution to the country's welfare. Lithuania, in contrast, lacks an integrated sector perspective, forestry and forest industries being regarded as two separate realms. Private forest property rights are severely constrained by numerous legislative stipulations, leading to a significant reduction of economic value in production forests. On top of that, thirty percent of private owners face additional restrictions through forestland zoning, leading to further substantial loss of economic value. We suggest several measures for improving the economic forest sustainability in Lithuania, where a genuine national forest program could serve as a suitable bearing medium.

AB  - Voluntary hatcheries, or hatcheries operated privately by local anglers and fishery owners, are a historical part of salmonid conservation and enhancement efforts in Europe. However, these types of hatcheries have faced increasing scrutiny over the last several decades because of the potential negative ecological impacts created by stocking salmon into wild (albeit declining) populations. We hypothesized that hatchery programs provide value to communities well beyond the possible conservation contribution to local salmon. Utilizing a qualitative ethnographic approach, we identified and classified a range of benefits produced by voluntary salmon hatcheries within three case studies in Norway, Wales, and Germany. Across all cases, voluntary hatcheries facilitated or provided diverse social, psychological, and conservation benefits to individuals and groups of cultivators, as well as to the river environment. Voluntary hatcheries can be considered as a visible means of environmental stewardship and are perceived by many operators as an important means for mitigating human obstacles to wild salmon conservation. Based on the multiple benefits that voluntary hatcheries create for the people engaged in hatchery activities, we lay out alternative views that add to the traditionally black-and-white, pro or anti-hatchery perspectives. Improved incorporation of multiple social-psychological hatchery benefits into future fisheries management decisions, outreach, and communication will provide a more holistic approach to sustainable hatchery management, reduce stakeholder conflict, foster civil engagement in salmon conservation, and enhance environmental stewardship.

AB  - The wild boar population has increased rapidly during the last 2 decades in Southern and Central Sweden. This rise in population size has caused severe damages to agricultural fields through their foraging behavior. Given the hierarchical nature of habitat and resource selection, wildlife management needs to understand the selection on both levels to better understand the ecology of nuisance species and mitigate the damages they infer. Thus, there is an urgent need for more knowledge on the factors that influence habitat selection as a tool in the evidence-based management of wild boar to reduce the losses they cause in the agricultural sector. This study aims to evaluate a common management action (feeding stations) influencing wild boar selection of (1) habitats and (2) resources i.e., crop types, in South-Central Sweden during summer. Eleven wild boars were fitted with GPS/GSM-collars to record movement among different habitats and crops. Wild boar shows a high preference for clear-cuts, agricultural fields, and deciduous forests. The animals showed a high preference for crop fields with oat, spring wheat, and mixed crops. A binary logistic model revealed both a positive and negative significant influence of distance to feeding stations on the selection of different habitats and crop fields. In general, feeding stations influenced the selection of different habitats and crops negatively i.e., the closer a habitat or crop field is to a feeding station, the higher the likelihood of its selection. The study recommends adjustments to wild boar management and cropping systems to reduce damages on highly selected crop fields.
