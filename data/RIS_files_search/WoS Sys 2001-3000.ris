AB  - Over time, community forests (CFs) have been established across the globe to meet various social, economic, and ecological needs. Benefits of CFs include conserving resilient forests and natural resources and ecosystem services, enhancing social and economic capital, and leveraging local and indigenous knowledge in forest and natural resource management and decision-making. Research on CFs in the U.S. is quite limited, and cases that have been assessed show a wide spectrum in terms of CF ownership, organizational structure, governance, property rights, and uses. Through an exploratory research approach, this study enhances the understanding of the characteristics of CFs in the U.S. and the ecosystem services and other benefits that they provide. Through online web searches, we compiled one of the first comprehensive lists of CFs in the Eastern U.S. Prior to this study, there was no publicly available comprehensive database or list of CFs in the country. Subsequently, we conducted comparative case study research, which included semi-structured in-person interviews with key stakeholders from four CFs in the Eastern U.S. to understand CF ownership, governance, uses, and benefits. CFs benefits frequently included cultural services, such as recreation and education, and regulating and supporting services, such as water quality and wildlife habitat. Much less common was a focus on provisioning services such as timber or non-timber forest products. Maintaining collaboration and funding for CF efforts in the long run without significant CF revenues remains a challenge for most forests. Overall, this research sheds lights on CF characteristics and capacities in the Eastern U.S. and identifies potential opportunities and needs for the U.S. in the future.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are some of the most difficult ecosystem services (ES) to characterize and connect to specific ecosystem processes. Given their connections to human emotion, deep meaning, fulfilment and motivation, they are also crucial for human well-being. Scholars have published hundreds of peer-reviewed articles addressing CES in myriad ways. In this systematic review, we analyse 232 peer-reviewed articles on CES and examine how these studies discuss the interaction between CES research and decision-making. We describe the primary ways that scholars have addressed the relationship between CES and decision-making, and we characterize each study with respect to how thoroughly its authors attend to the possible applications of their results. We find that 27% of papers discuss connections to decision-making in general terms, 28% discuss specific connections to decision-making, and the remainder mention decision-making links briefly or not at all. We also discuss patterns based on the particular CES studied (e.g. recreation, identity); methods used; change through time; and geographical location of authors and of study sites. We end with reflections on the current state of the interface between CES (and related concepts for approaching the non-material values associated with ecosystems) and decision-making, and we discuss future steps to increase connections between CES and decision-making.

AB  - The world market for solid biofuels has increased in the last few years, with special attention to the production of pellets and briquettes in emerging bioeconomies. This study presents a systematic review and exploratory Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biomass briquettes and pellets produced in Latin America, and suggests short-term opportunities and political implications. The review was organized following the scoping methodology en bloc with the Standardized Technique for Assessing and Reporting Reviews of Life Cycle Assessment Data - STARR-LCA, in Scopus, Web of Science and Scielo databases. A final list of 150 publications was selected. The review results showed that most of the publications were from Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Costa Rica, and are mainly focused on exploring the thermo-mechanics properties of pellets and briquettes instead of the environmental impacts. Thus, an exploratory LCA was performed based on the data gathered from literature with a focus on global warming potential, terrestrial acidification potential, freshwater eutrophication potential, cumulative energy demand, land use and water consumption. Global warming results ranged from -68.7 (Chilean pellets) to 103 g CO2-eq (Brazilian charcoal briquettes), and pellet productions showed lower values of impacts (-68.7 to 1.33 g CO2-eq) per functional unit. The best scenario, however, was found for the Brazilian briquettes production contributing with less than 10% of the overall relative impacts for cumulative energy demand (0.340 MJ-eq), terrestrial acidification potential (8.59 mg SO2-eq), freshwater eutrophication potential (0.969 mg PO4-eq), land use (136 cm(2)a crop-eq) and water consumption (108 cm(3)), where urban forest residues were used as biomass. The worst-case scenario was found for the charcoal briquettes in Brazil and pellet productions from palm fruit branches in Colombia. Dedicated systems to the pellets/briquettes production seem to be more environmentally benign options than the multifunctional systems investigated. In terms of political implications, it was verified the great potential from these different types of densified biomass in improving and expanding emission trading systems both inside and outside Latin America.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the main scientific contributions in the field of sustainable seaports, with a particular focus on passenger seaports and passenger seaports' commitment to sustainability. The focus of this analysis is on the methods used to improve and develop a sustainable seaport. A search of the Web of Science Core Collection that addresses this topic consists of scientific articles published from 2012 to 2022. The articles are divided into seven groups by research area (technical/technological, legal, organisational, economic, social, environmental, and other) and five groups by applied methodology (literature review, theoretical approach, qualitative approach/methods, quantitative approach/methods, and other). The results show that most of the papers were published in the field of the environmental impacts of a sustainable seaport and a sustainable passenger seaport. In addition, most papers used quantitative approach/methods.

TI  - Characteristics of successful programmes targeting gender inequality and restrictive gender norms for the health and wellbeing of children, adolescents, and young adults: a systematic review
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Background In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and the shifting global burden of disease, this systematic review analyses the evidence from rigorously evaluated programmes that seek to transform the gendered social norms undermining the health and wellbeing of children, adolescents, and young adults. The aim of this study was threefold: to describe the landscape of gender-transformative programmes that attempt to influence health-related outcomes; to identify mechanisms through which successful programmes work; and to highlight where gaps might exist in implementation and evaluation.
   Methods We systematically reviewed rigorous evaluations published between Jan 1, 2000, and Nov 1, 2018 of programmes that sought to decrease gender inequalities and transform restrictive gender norms to improve the health and wellbeing of 0-24 year olds. We included rigorously evaluated health programmes that met the Interagency Gender Working Group definition of gender-transformative programming, regardless of where in the world they were implemented and what area of health they focused on.
   Findings Among 22993 articles identified by our search, 61 evaluations of 59 programmes met review criteria. Programmes were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (25 [42%1), south Asia (13 [22%]), and North America (13 [22%]) and mainly measured health indicators related to reproductive health (29 [48%]), violence (26 [43%]), or HIV (18 [30%]). Programmes most frequently focused on improving the individual power of the beneficiaries, rather than working on broader systems of inequality. 45 (74%) of the evaluations measured significant improvements in health-related and gender-related indicators; however, only ten (16%) showed evidence of, or potential for, broader norm change. These ten programmes worked with sectors beyond health, included multiple stakeholders, implemented diversified strategies, and fostered critical awareness and participation among affected community members.
   Interpretation This review can accelerate efforts to improve global health by leading to more strategic investment in programmes that promote gender equality and target restrictive gender norms among young people. Such programmes can lead to a lifetime of improved health and wellbeing by challenging not only attitudes and behaviours related to gender at an early age, but also the gendered systems that surround them.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) provided by nature-based solutions (NBS) have been examined using various data collection techniques and preference elicitation methods to understand what ES are important to human well-being. This article provides a systematic review of 153 scientific publications, with a focus on data collection techniques and perspectives of well-being used when eliciting preferences toward multiple ES provided by NBS. ES provided by urban parks, urban trees, and community gardens are the most commonly examined; however, generally specified NBS such as "green spaces" or "green infrastructure" prevail. The review further shows that the questionnaire surveys is the dominant technique for bringing evidence about the most preferred ES, followed by semi-structured interviews and workshops. Only a limited number of studies use revealed or stated preference methods as a part of data collection efforts such as a choice experiment or contingent valuation. Additionally, the review defines three different perspectives of well-being considered but rarely discussed in existing studies: individual; community; and society well-being perspectives. As the concept of well-being is hardly discussed in NBS literature and still depends on a large degree of subjectivity, this review highlights the need for future research that looks more deeply at individual, community, and social well-being, which is influenced differently by the implementation of NBS.

AB  - Background: There are many clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). They differ by region, considering local health care systems, along with cultural and economic factors. Currently, there are conflicting CPG recommendations across the various publications, which makes it difficult for clinicians to fully understand the optimal treatment decisions for knee OA management. Purpose: To summarize the current published CPG recommendations for the role of injections in the nonoperative management of knee OA, specifically with the use of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IA-HA), intra-articular corticosteroids (IA-CS), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: A comprehensive search identified all nonoperative knee OA CPGs within the ECRI (formerly Emergency Care Research Institute) Guidelines Trust database, the Guidelines International Network database, Google Scholar, and the Trip (formerly Turning Research Into Practice) database. Guideline recommendations were categorized into strong, conditional, or uncertain recommendations for or against the use of IA-HA, IA-CS, or PRP. Guideline recommendations were summarized and depicted graphically to identify trends in recommendations over time. Results: The search strategy identified 27 CPGs that provided recommendations. There were 20 recommendations in favor of IA-HA use, 21 recommendations in favor of IA-CS use, and 9 recommendations that were uncertain or unable to make a formal recommendation for or against PRP use based on current evidence. Most recommendations considered IA-HA and IA-CS use for symptom relief when other nonoperative options are ineffective. IA-CS were noted to provide fast and short-acting symptom relief for acute episodes of disease exacerbation, while IA-HA may demonstrate a relatively delayed but prolonged effect in comparison. The CPGs concluded that PRP recommendations currently lack evidence to definitively recommend for or against use. Conclusion: Available CPGs provide recommendations on injectables for knee OA treatment. General guidance from a global perspective concluded that IA-CS and IA-HA are favored for different needed responses and can be utilized within the knee OA treatment paradigm, while PRP currently has insufficient evidence to make a conclusive recommendation for or against its use.

AB  - Recommendations for responding to climate change in forest management have proliferated over the past two decades. A systematic review of the scientific literature revealed that the majority of such recommendations (86%) focused primarily on maintaining existing ecological patterns and processes via either passive or active adaptation approaches, while 14% focused on transformation to new system configurations through active interventions. Most recommendations (69%) were general, non-specific principles and derived from research conducted in North America or Europe. These findings highlight the need for (1) more actionable recommendations and diversification in geographic inquiry, specifically in Asia, Africa, Oceania, Latin America, and the Caribbean; (2) increased contributions from social science and mixed social-ecological inquiry; and (3) governance processes that enhance dialogue among stakeholders to better anticipate and navigate the trade-offs implied by potential future forests in the decades to come.

AB  - Background: Harmful practices in the management of childhood diarrhea are associated with negative health outcomes, and conflict with WHO treatment guidelines. These practices include restriction of fluids, breast milk and/or food intake during diarrhea episodes, and incorrect use of modern medicines. We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature published since 1990 to assess the documented prevalence of these four harmful practices, and beliefs, motivations, and contextual factors associated with harmful practices in low-and middle-income countries.
   Methods: We electronically searched PubMed, Embase, Ovid Global Health, and the WHO Global Health Library. Publications reporting the prevalence or substantive findings on beliefs, motivations, or context related to at least one of the four harmful practices were included, regardless of study design or representativeness of the sample population.
   Results: Of the 114 articles included in the review, 79 reported the prevalence of at least one harmful practice and 35 studies reported on beliefs, motivations, or context for harmful practices. Most studies relied on sub-national population samples and many were limited to small sample sizes. Study design, study population, and definition of harmful practices varied across studies. Reported prevalence of harmful practices varied greatly across study populations, and we were unable to identify clearly defined patterns across regions, countries, or time periods. Caregivers reported that diarrhea management practices were based on the advice of others (health workers, relatives, community members), as well as their own observations or understanding of the efficacy of certain treatments for diarrhea. Others reported following traditionally held beliefs on the causes and cures for specific diarrheal diseases.
   Conclusions: Available evidence suggests that harmful practices in diarrhea treatment are common in some countries with a high burden of diarrhea-related mortality. These practices can reduce correct management of diarrheal disease in children and result in treatment failure, sustained nutritional deficits, and increased diarrhea mortality. The lack of consistency in sampling, measurement, and reporting identified in this literature review highlights the need to document harmful practices using standard methods of measurement and reporting for the continued reduction of diarrhea mortality.

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) can drop off passengers at predetermined destinations and relocate to less expensive, remote parking facilities, which offers the potential to repurpose valuable urban land near activity centers for alternative uses beyond vehicle storage. While some researchers believe AVs are the core element to solving parking problems, relieving urban land use, and enabling low-emission travel, others contend that AVs could incentivize increased Vehicles Miles Traveled (VMT) and exacerbate congestion. To bridge these disparate perspectives, this study endeavors to elucidate the environmental ramifications of AVs on parking through a comprehensive literature review. Based on an initial sample of 299 retrieved papers, 52 studies were selected as the result of the selection criteria detailed in the paper. The selected papers were categorized into five gradual parts to answer the raised research questions. As a principal finding of this study, our research provides city planners, traffic operators, and scholars with full-picture insights and trustworthy guidance, emphasizing the pivotal role of AVs in deciphering the sustainable impact on the urban environment.

AB  - The popular perception that humans are undergoing a global extinction of "experience of nature" (EoN) is poorly supported by empirical evidence. Here, we provide - to the best of our knowledge - the first global systematic review of trends in EoN, identifying only 18 studies that measured temporal trends in EoN. Of those 18 studies, several reported negative trends over time for both direct EoN (for example, in-person visits to parklands) and vicarious EoN (specifically, the presence of nature in cultural products, such as movies or books), and all were biased toward North America, Western Europe, and Japan. As an initial proxy for understudied regions, we calculated past trends in three metrics of global EoN opportunities and show that, over the past decades, the locations where humans live have shifted away from the natural world and become more urban, while forest cover in cities has decreased. Overall, our results suggest that while EoN may be declining globally, existing evidence is insufficient to assess the magnitude and generality of this phenomenon.

AB  - The importance of newly created approaches that leads to sustainability in our communities and economies cannot be overemphasized in today's fast growing world. Smart growth has appeared in the reality of Unites States to solve the problems of urban sprawls. Thus having a strategy which will create communities with diverse housing and transportation options, will create better links with neighbourhoods, and will promote community engagement. However, in Europe it appeared as a part of Europe 2020 strategy, where it has a goal to bring more effective investments in education, research and innovation. A systematic review was applied in the paper. It was employed the collection of research papers about smart growth as a public policy, as a means of sustainable development, as an asset of an effective growth and as a new concept in European Union.
   It was revealed that in both continents the concept is getting more popularity by policy makers and it is strongly linked with sustainable development.

AB  - Climate change (CC) is a key, global driver of change of marine ecosystems. At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented.
   At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS.
   Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many factors threaten European Soils, and currently, all the Member States (MS) are introducing many types of soil protection measures. Erosion, pollution, sealing and decline of the organic matter are just some of the threats that affect one of the primary non-removable resources of the planet. Soils play a vital role in the biodiversity and are the provider of numerous Ecosystem Services that support human life on Earth.
   Following the withdrawal of the Soil Framework Directive proposal by the European Commission, we investigate how the different MS of the European Union (EU) address sustainable soil management under the pressures of different threats.
   The methodology used is based on a gap analysis applied to the instruments and/or policies adopted by the MS to contrast the various threats according to their specific level of intensity. The study presents for the first time a systematic review of the current EU policies covering all the regulatory instruments, the economic instruments, the information tools, the monitoring systems, and the research and innovation activities.
   The comparative analysis of the different approaches adopted by MS reveals the absence of a common EU strategy to address soil protection and the inefficacy of the subsidiary principle in the sustainable management of soil resources especially in the view of addressing the Sustainable Development Goals achieving the targets by 2030.
   Results show how the lack of a Soil Framework Directive has weakened the possibility to have strong coordination among the MS for soil protection. Each Country is adopting an autonomous legislative framework which reveals a huge dis-homogeneity and un-coherences among approaches.

AB  - This article describes and discusses the scientific production that relates tourism to governance in the 2013-2019 period. The purpose is to glimpse the different perspectives of governance and its main theoretical and empirical contributions to the tourist field. Through a semi systematic review and the content analysis technique, nine perspectives were identified: Good governance, governance networks, metagovernance, Tourism Destination Governance, local, territorial, multilevel, corporate, and environmental governance. It is concluded that, on the one hand, traditional themes such as sustainability, local development and territoriality predominate in the literature; but on the other, researchers are venturing into cutting-edge issues such as cross boarder governance, metagovernance and networks. This variety of perspectives that link governance to tourism has caused dispersion in their contributions, which has limited the consolidation of tourism and governance as a field of study.

AB  - Sustainable resource management requires governance systems that facilitate effective collaboration among a variety of stakeholder interests, across jurisdictional scales and resource sectors. Yet, there is not widespread scholarly agreement on the key ingredients that need to be present to facilitate the effective collaborative governance of natural resources. To address this scholarly gap, we conducted a systematic literature review which revealed 17 publications that compiled essential lists of key factors for effective collaboration. From these studies across multiple disciplines, we identified 22 common factors associated with effective collaborative natural resource management, including near unanimous acceptance of the importance of nested governance structures and conflict resolution mechanisms. These 22 factors, along with additional contextual and outcome-oriented factors, could begin to form a core set of factors to comparatively test large numbers of case studies on collaborative governance of social-ecological systems around the world.

AB  - Inherited system features and challenges that can hinder urban planning initiatives must be taken into consideration before a path towards a sustainable future can be established. By putting the lock-in effect under scrutiny, it is possible to gain valuable insight to emphasize positive lock-ins and to prevent maladaptation and unsustainable solutions. This paper aims to review the current trends of urban studies regarding sustainability, resilience, and the lock-in effect, focusing on both hot topics and mutual integration by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR protocol) and analyzing the top-cited articles on these topics from 2015 to 2021 in the Web of Science database. Based on the revised literature, the potential lock-ins of climate-friendly and sustainable urban development are not adequately discussed. Moreover, while urban sustainability and resilience are often treated as overlapping areas, there is a lack of publications that carefully examine their interlinked long-term perspectives for any hindering effects.

AB  - The loss of interactions and ecosystem functions is a concerning by-product of pervasive Anthropocene species decline and extinction. Ecological interactions between species sustain the provision of ecosystem processes, especially those mediated by trophic relationships such as pollination and predation. At the local habitat scale, the diversity of natural food sources may increase the diversity of interactions, thus enhancing the stability of local communities and ecosystem functioning. Here I discuss the importance of bromeliads as a potential provider of additional trophic interactions with birds, a key animal group in the Neotropics. Based on 88 studies published between 1965 and 2020 across the Neotropical region, I observed that bromeliads act as 'wildlife restaurants' by providing an additional food source throughout the year in almost all Neotropical ecosystems for at least 162 bird species (mostly hummingbirds). These plants (both epiphytic and terrestrial forms) can provide nectar, flowers, water for drinking, invertebrates, small vertebrates, seeds, and fruits, as well as nest materials and substrates. Given these trophic relationships between bromeliads and birds, actions to restore the richness and abundance of these plants in changed habitats would potentially enhance the local diversity of birds. I discuss and recommend the use of bromeliad transplantations as a relevant conservation tool for birds and some implications for the maintenance of species and interaction diversity in natural and agricultural habitats.

AB  - Cumulative impacts increasingly threaten marine and coastal ecosystems. To address this issue, the research community has invested efforts on designing and testing different methodological approaches and tools that apply cumulative impact appraisal schemes for a sound evaluation of the complex interactions and dynamics among multiple pressures affecting marine and coastal ecosystems.Through an iterative scientometric and systematic literature review, this paper provides the state of the art of cumulative impact assessment approaches and applications. It gives a specific attention to cutting-edge approaches that explore and model inter-relations among climatic and anthropogenic pressures, vulnerability and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems to these pressures, and the resulting changes in ecosystem services flow. Despite recent advances in computer sciences and the rising availability of big data for environmental monitoring and management, this literature review evidenced that the implementation of advanced complex system methods for cumulative risk assessment remains limited. Moreover, experts have only recently started integrating ecosystem services flow into cumulative impact appraisal frameworks, but more as a general assessment endpoint within the overall evaluation process (e.g. changes in the bundle of ecosystem services against cumulative impacts). The review also highlights a lack of integrated approaches and complex tools able to frame, explain, and model spatio-temporal dynamics of marine and coastal ecosystems' response to multiple pressures, as required under relevant EU legislation (e.g., Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives). Progress in understanding cumulative impacts, exploiting the functionalities of more sophisticated machine learning-based approaches (e.g., big data integration), will support decisionmakers in the achievement of environmental and sustainability objectives.

AB  - The increase in the complexity of supply chains requires greater efforts to align the activities of all its members in order to improve the creation of value of their products or services offered to customers. In general, the information is asymmetric; each member has its own objective and limitations that may be in conflict with other members. Operations managements face the challenge of coordinating activities in such a way that the supply chain as a whole remains competitive, while each member improves by cooperating. This document aims to offer a systematic review of the collaborative planning in the last decade on the mechanisms of coordination in mathematical programming models that allow us to position existing concepts and identify areas where more research is needed.

AB  - Translocations are an important conservation tool that enable the restoration of species and their ecological functions. They are particularly important during the current environmental crisis. We used a combination of text-analysis tools to track the history and evolution of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on animal translocation science. We compared this corpus with research showcased in the IUCNs Global Conservation Translocation Perspectives, a curated collection of non-peer-reviewed reintroduction case studies. We show that the peer-reviewed literature, in its infancy, was dominated by charismatic species. It then grew in two classical threads: management of the species of concern and management of the environment of the species. The peer-reviewed literature exhibits a bias towards large charismatic mammals, and while these data are invaluable, expansion to under-represented groups such as insects and reptiles will be critical to combating biodiversity loss across taxonomic groups. These biases were similar in the Translocation Perspectives, but with some subtle differences. To ensure translocation science can address global issues, we need to overcome barriers that restrict this research to a limited number of countries.

AB  - The capacity of cities to act on climate change mitigation is essential to fulfil the Paris Agreement target. In order to do so, cities should establish an effective climate policy which requires, as a first step, a complete greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory. The accurate city-scale GHG inventory enables cities to develop, implement and track climate solution measures, mainly those related to transportation. The compilation of a city-scale GHG inventory requires a standardized method and up-to-date activity data. This systematic review critically examines 40 articles over the past 20 years to (1) identify city-scale GHG inventory methods being applied worldwide, (2) evaluate how these methods are evolving, (3) elaborate how emissions from transport sector are being estimated, and (4) determine what data types and sources of transport-related data are being used. The review was limited to articles that addressed the process of compilation of a GHG inventory. The results demonstrate that city-scale GHG inventory methods evolved from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines to a variety of GHG accounting methods that offer levels of complexity to estimate city-scale emissions. Although GHG inventory methods for city-scale have advanced over the years, almost one third of the articles reviewed were focused on the proposal of a GHG inventory framework, adjusting current methods to each city's reality or proposing new ones. The majority of the cities analysed lack local transport-related data to measure GHG emissions based on the bottom-up approach. Yet, more than 40% of the articles managed to deliver the bottom-up inventory using a diversity of data types and sources. This review shows that there is still a path to achieve a globally compatible method. This would require a joint effort between researchers and city authorities to make international protocols more compliant to each city's data availability along with the improvement of cities data collection.

AB  - To achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, transformative actions are needed. The circular economy (CE) is one concept that gained popularity in recent years, with its proclaimed selling point to combine economic development with benefits to businesses, society, and the environment. However, definitions of CE diverge, applications appear across vastly different settings, and overall there is a lack of understanding of how much CE strategies can contribute to climate change mitigation (mitigation). We systematically screened 3244 records in Web of Science and Scopus, restricted to papers in English. We then selected studies against pre-determined eligibility criteria that, had to (1) refer explicitly to CE or closely related concepts (e.g. performance economy, cradle-to-cradle, material or product efficiency); and (2) refer to a climate change mitigation potential. We identified 341 studies, summarized, and grouped into six sectors (industry, waste, energy, buildings, transport, and agriculture). These sectors are not completely mutually exclusive, but partially overlapping. Nonetheless, sectoral classifications relate to existing categorizations and map well with international assessments of climate change mitigations, such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our review sets out to summarize the results of the scientific literature on the extent to which CE strategies can contribute to mitigation. Even though our query explicitly required a consideration of climate change, only 10% of all studies contributed insights on how the CE can support mitigation. We find that the highest saving potential is evidenced in the industry, energy, and transport sector; mid-range savings in the waste and building sector; and lowest gains are to be expected in agriculture. The majority of studies investigate incremental measures claiming but not demonstrating climate change mitigation. Most studies indicate potential but implementation remains weak. Assessments should move from attributional to consequential analysis to avoid misleading policy makers.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture is socially, culturally and economically important in Southeast Asia, but its expansion in the last fifty years has had negative environmental and social consequences. Through analyses of detailed accounts of the expansion of coastal aquaculture, we aimed to increase knowledge of the factors underlying this expansion to guide future policies for sustainable management of the coastal zone. Using a systematic review of ninety studies, we found that increased aquaculture development and economic opportunities were the most frequently identified proximate drivers of coastal aquaculture expansion, while factors associated with location (e.g. availability of mangrove land), institutional policies and economy (e.g. capital investment and market demand) had lesser influence. However, complex combinations of the underlying factors were also important. For example, the influence of policies that stimulated aquaculture development was often associated with combinations of locational, institutional, economic, technological and social factors. Strategies aimed at enhancing expansion of sustainable coastal aquaculture and mangrove conservation should focus on government policy interventions, including those that support mangrove silvo-aquaculture.

AB  - "Co-design" has become a widely used approach in land use science to address complex sustainability challenges. However, the term "co-design" is applied in quite different contexts, often implying different meanings and practices to implementation which leads to terminological fuzziness. Since an overview and synthesis of these different approaches is still missing, this systematic review aims at shedding light on the different meanings of "co-design," systematizing the body of literature on land use sciences, and exploring how scientists and experts implement co-design processes in practice. Applying a quantitative meta-analysis of 88 SCOPUS-listed publi-cations, we identified two main objectives and types for conducting co-design research: Seventy-six studies aim at jointly developing problem-solving interventions for sustainable transformations ("intervention type"), whereas 12 studies seek to collaboratively develop research questions or agendas (type: "co-created research designs"). Using a qualitative in-depth analysis, we further divide the "intervention type" corpus into four subtypes: (a) "researcher-led and model-based" and (b) "social science-driven intervention" studies applying a rigorous pre-defined study design where scientists are the dominant actors. Subtype (c) includes studies that develop "design-led and practice-oriented interventions" and rather focus on practical outcomes than on sci-entific knowledge production. The subtype (d) "transformative transdisciplinary interventions and living labs" shows the strongest ties to transdisciplinary research philosophy, theory, methodology, and practice. Co-citation -network analyses reveal that these subtypes have partly evolved independently from each other by using different theoretical and methodological references. Generally, "co-design" is applied in various ways, but without an agreement on what exactly "co-design" entails. It is often used intuitively across the subtypes, without carefully reflecting the existing theoretical and methodological foundations. Finally, we provide suggestions for supporting an integration of "co-design" into future research projects in a more conscious and sound way.

AB  - Objective: To identify sustainable governance arrangements for health care organisations undertaking integrated health service delivery based on best available evidence.
   Method: Systematic review of the literature (1990-2006), supported by key informant interviews as an integrative process.
   Results: 16 studies met our selection criteria. All described enablers of and barriers to delivering integrated health services. We identified three models for integrated health care governance with a demonstrated ability to be sustained in the medium term. Common themes that emerged as the logical starting point for more ambitious integrated governance arrangements regionally were: the need for a clear separation between governance and operational management; and the need for local communities with the vision, leadership and commitment to extend health service integration. These themes were reinforced by interviews with key informants. Careful measurement of the process, impact and outcomes of such activities was often overlooked.
   Conclusion: State governments are increasingly attempting to work with non-government organisations and the private sector to maximise scarce resources in the face of increasing health care demand. Ambitious integration agendas must be underpinned by effective governance mechanisms that are appropriate to the undertaking, the stakeholders involved and the scale of delivery,

AB  - Aims Lower parental education has been linked to adverse youth mental health outcomes. However, the relationship between parental education and youth suicidal behaviours remains unclear. We explored the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts, and examined whether sociocultural contexts moderate such associations. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline and Embase from 1900 to December 2020 for studies with participants aged 0-18, and provided quantitative data on the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts (death included). Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of the articles. One author extracted data [e.g. number of cases and non-cases in each parental education level, effect sizes in forms of odds ratios (ORs) or beta coefficients]. We then calculated pooled ORs using a random-effects model and used moderator analysis to investigate heterogeneity. Results We included a total of 59 articles (63 study samples, totalling 2 738 374 subjects) in the meta-analysis. Lower parental education was associated with youth suicidal attempts [OR = 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.04-1.21] but not with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.12). Geographical region and country income level moderated the associations. Lower parental education was associated with an increased risk of youth suicidal attempts in Northern America (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.45), but with a decreased risk in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54-0.96). An association of lower parental education and increased risk of youth suicidal ideation was present in high- income countries (HICs) (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.25), and absent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77-1.08). Conclusions The association between youth suicidal behaviours and parental education seems to differ across geographical and economical contexts, suggesting that cultural, psychosocial or biological factors may play a role in explaining this association. Although there was high heterogeneity in the studies reviewed, this evidence suggests that the role of familial sociodemographic characteristics in youth suicidality may not be universal. This highlights the need to consider cultural, as well as familial factors in the clinical assessment and management of youth's suicidal behaviours in our increasingly multicultural societies, as well as in developing prevention and intervention strategies for youth suicide.

AB  - Aims To identify and categorise core components of effective stigma reduction interventions in the field of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and compare these components across cultural contexts and between intervention characteristics. Methods Seven databases were searched with a strategy including four categories of terms ('stigma', 'mental health', 'intervention' and 'low- and middle-income countries'). Additional methods included citation chaining of all papers identified for inclusion, consultation with experts and hand searching reference lists from other related reviews. Studies on interventions in LMICs aiming to reduce stigma related to mental health with a stigma-related outcome measure were included. All relevant intervention characteristics and components were extracted and a quality assessment was undertaken. A 'best fit' framework synthesis was used to organise data, followed by a narrative synthesis. Results Fifty-six studies were included in this review, of which four were ineffective and analysed separately. A framework was developed which presents a new categorisation of stigma intervention components based on the included studies. Most interventions utilised multiple methods and of the 52 effective studies educational methods were used most frequently (n= 83), and both social contact (n= 8) and therapeutic methods (n= 3) were used infrequently. Most interventions (n= 42) based their intervention on medical knowledge, but a variety of other themes were addressed. All regions with LMICs were represented, but every region was dominated by studies from one country. Components varied between regions for most categories indicating variation between cultures, but only a minority of studies were developed in the local setting or culturally adapted. Conclusions Our study suggests effective mental health stigma reduction interventions in LMICs have increased in quantity and quality over the past five years, and a wide variety of components have been utilised successfully - from creative methods to emphasis on recovery and strength of people with mental illness. Yet there is minimal mention of social contact, despite existing strong evidence for it. There is also a lack of robust research designs, a high number of short-term interventions and follow-up, nominal use of local expertise and the research is limited to a small number of LMICs. More research is needed to address these issues. Some congruity exists in components between cultures, but generally they vary widely. The review gives an in-depth overview of mental health stigma reduction core components, providing researchers in varied resource-poor settings additional knowledge to help with planning mental health stigma reduction interventions.

AB  - Purpose- Decision-making, reinforced by artificial intelligence (AI), is predicted to become potent tool within the domain of supply chain management. Considering the importance of this subject, the purpose of this study is to explore the triggers and technological inhibitors affecting the adoption of AI. This study also aims to identify three-dimensional triggers, notably those linked to environmental, social, and governance (ESG), as well as technological inhibitors.Design/methodology/approach- Drawing upon a six-step systematic review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a broad range of journal publications was recognized, with a thematic analysis under the lens of the ESG framework, offering a unique perspective on factors triggering and inhibiting AI adoption in the supply chain.Findings- In the environmental dimension, triggers include product waste reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, highlighting the potential of AI in promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility. In the social dimension, triggers encompass product security and quality, as well as social well-being, indicating how AI can contribute to ensuring safe and high-quality products and enhancing societal welfare. In the governance dimension, triggers involve agile and lean practices, cost reduction, sustainable supplier selection, circular economy initiatives, supply chain risk management, knowledge sharing and the synergy between supply and demand. The inhibitors in the technological category present challenges, encompassing the lack of regulations and rules, data security and privacy concerns, responsible and ethical AI considerations, performance and ethical assessment difficulties, poor data quality, group bias and the need to achieve synergy between AI and human decision-makers.Research limitations/implications- Despite the use of PRISMA guidelines to ensure a comprehensive search and screening process, it is possible that some relevant studies in other databases and industry reports may have been missed. In light of this, the selected studies may not have fully captured the diversity of triggers and technological inhibitors. The extraction of themes from the selected papers is subjective in nature and relies on the interpretation of researchers, which may introduce bias.Originality/value- The research contributes to the field by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the diverse factors that trigger or inhibit AI adoption, providing valuable insights into their impact. By incorporating the ESG protocol, the study offers a holistic evaluation of the dimensions associated with AI adoption in the supply chain, presenting valuable implications for both industry professionals and researchers. The originality lies in its in-depth examination of the multifaceted aspects of AI adoption, making it a valuable resource for advancing knowledge in this area.

AB  - Mangrove forests in Southeast Asia are continuously declining as a result of unsustainable practices, partly due to limited recognition of the value of mangrove services in land use decision making. Valuation practitioners have assumed that monetary valuation should inform local and national decision makers to ensure sustainable management of mangrove resources. For ecosystem service valuation to be of use to decision makers, best practices should be adhered to such as having straightforward policy questions and strong stakeholder engagement from the onset of valuation studies, suitable choice of valuation methodologies, and the ability to effectively demonstrate causal links between drivers of ecosystem health, change, and resource users. This study, focusing on the Malaysian case study, assessed the effectiveness and challenges of local ecosystem service valuation studies in informing mangrove management decisions against a set of global best practices. A systematic review approach was undertaken to identify relevant Malaysian mangrove ecosystem service valuation studies. Of 184 studies identified, only 17 provided monetary values for mangrove ecosystem services. These studies valued nine different mangrove ecosystem services, with the cultural ecosystem services of tourism being the most frequently valued. Most of the valuation studies were designed to raise awareness of the value of ecosystems (64.7%). Other intended uses included determining appropriate charging rates for mangrove uses (17.6%), comparing the costs and benefits of different environmental uses (11.8%), and providing a justification and support for certain decision making (5.9%). Overall, mangrove valuation studies in Malaysia were characterized by weak multi-stakeholder engagement, non-standardized valuation units across the whole country, limited dissemination of the valuation outcome, and cursory references to the potential use of mangrove ecosystem services. Most of the studies did not exert apparent influence on mangrove management. Future valuation studies in Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region should aim to build more robust engagement between valuation practitioners and key stakeholder groups, especially decision makers, at all stages of the study process and incorporate a clear dissemination strategy for sharing results.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, mainly no-tillage (NT), cover cropping (CC), soil fertilization with organic amendments (OA), and crop-livestock (CL) and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) systems, has been widely adopted in areas from Brazilian Cerrado. The CSA may partly offset former soil C losses and contribute to climate change mitigation. However, contradictory findings brought uncertainties about the effect of CSA on soil C. Here, by a systematic review of 87 papers and using 621 data pairs, we provided a pervasive biome-scale analysis of soil C stock changes associated with the adoption of CSA across Brazilian Cerrado. All CSA practices evaluated showed average positive rates of C stock change, indicating a general tendency of soil C accretion after its adoption. In areas under NT, CC and CLF, greater rates were estimated for the deeper soil profile evaluated (0.00-1.00 m) (1.24 +/- 0.85, 0.54 +/- 0.54 and 1.00 +/- 1.47 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively), while OA and CL showed more soil C accretion when the assessment was limited down to 0.10 m depth (0.82 +/- 0.60 and 0.59 +/- 0.66 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively). Unfortunately, the lack of basic information precluded any attempt to statically compare our estimations. In this sense, we must be cautious in stating that soil C sequestration occurs at those rates after the adoption of CSA practices. Despite these limitations, the results clearly show that the diversification and intensification of agricultural areas in the Cerrado by the adoption of CSA is a promising pathway to increase soil C stocks, and consequently, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Finally, our findings emphasize the importance of efforts that stimulate farmers to adopt these practices on large scale, such as Brazil's Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan, besides providing sound empirical evidence about the role of soil C sequestration in Brazil achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions commitments.

AB  - Global environmental changes are multifactorial and affected by multiple forms of land use. For this reason, and also in view of the current world climate scenario, they have become highly relevant and are subject to analysis and discussions on the best uses of land. The research presented here offers a systematic analysis on the priorities related to the multiple uses of land and their implications in urban planning. An exploratory and descriptive analysis is used with a qualitative approach based in a systematic literature review. General findings indicate that land uses arise amid the duality between economy and environmental concerns, while increasing frequencies of heat islands, desertification, suppression of green areas in cities, and other phenomena are the backdrop. Urban planning tied to social and environmental dynamics becomes a powerful engine to predict rational uses of the land, enabling and balancing the economic-environmental dynamics without overriding each other. Proper planning of urban land governs both the infrastructure itself and the human influence over space in addition to predicting future uses and disuse as well as actions not consistent with sustainable development.

AB  - Purpose The literature on coworking spaces (CSs) is growing fast; notably, this topic has attracted a wide range of contributions from various disciplines during the past years. Although CSs first appeared in major cities, small towns and rural areas are also becoming attractive. To date, no literature review has systematically studied the effects of such collaborative-flexible new working spaces proliferating in non-urban areas. Therefore, this paper aims to present a systematic literature review about the effects of coworking spaces located in peripheral and rural areas. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, also known as PRISMA. Following the PRISMA checklist items, this study provides different aspects and identifies indicators from various cross-studies published in 10 years (2011-2021). Findings Results show that, in the past decade, Europe has recorded the highest number of publications on the topic of coworking spaces (CSs); the main research focus was on spatial planning. CSs foster communities of specialized and high-skilled workers, attract businesses and venture capitalists and may accelerate urban revitalisation processes. The regeneration of spaces can positively affect the value of commercial properties in the vicinity and attract developers. Moreover, by establishing communities and networks beyond the working life, coworking was found to reduce depopulation and even foster the influx of non-urban areas. Practical implications The findings of this study can be transferred to policymakers to be considered in designing tailored policies in non-urban areas and also places-that-don't matter. Originality/value By date, this study is the first attempt to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the effects of coworking spaces in peripheral and rural areas. This is important since this typology of flexible-collaborative working space is gaining public attention, especially during the pandemic and the development of such spaces in non-urban areas.

AB  - Urban forest modeling is becoming increasingly complex, global, and transdisciplinary. Increased modeling of urban forest structure and function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the similarities and differences between modeling techniques and applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales, compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met computational fluid dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors. Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem services. Such knowledge is critical for policy- and decision-makers, and can help improve urban forest planning, design and management.

AB  - Road infrastructure is a vital aspect in transportation systems and can be severely affected by disasters. Postdisaster impact assessment is vital for the repair and reconstruction of such infrastructure, which is constrained by budget and time. This review provides a detailed analysis of prior literature on postdisaster impact assessments of road infrastructure. The related methods used in the literature were analyzed based on their classifications, such as social, environmental, and economic impacts of road failure. It was determined that although a wide range of methods have been used to assess economic impacts, there is still a lack of research measuring environmental and indirect social impacts. Prior literature has also highlighted that the use of bottom-up models to assess socioeconomic impacts is more relevant in the aftermath of a disaster. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature and guidelines for selecting the most appropriate method to assess impacts. This review aims to provide a frame of reference for researchers and government authorities involved in postdisaster impact assessment and decision making related to road infrastructure.

AB  - Fragmented agriculture land use remains a policy concern in Rwanda. In response to this, since 2008, land use consolidation (LUC) has been at the central of the agricultural intensification as a component of the Crop Intensification Programme (CIP). It is designed to reduce poverty and ensure national food and nutrition security. Despite emerging positive LUC's effects, fragmented land use persists especially more on the hillside than the marshlands. Existing studies assessing the effectiveness and impacts of LUC have so far generated a mixed and opposing evidence. To enlighten on the current status and dynamics of LUC, this paper has used a systematic review of research conducted to take stock of available empirical evidence on LUC's impacts across economic, food and nutrition security, and environmental and climate change resilience outcomes. Our results substantiate that none of the identified case studies has provided a strong basis to establish the overall effectiveness and impact of land use consolidation. Existing studies have only addressed some constituents of LUC and impacts on certain outcomes while leaving others unpacked. This leaves the studies vulnerable to potential biases, leading consequently to under or overestimate of LUC's effects. Going forward, we stress a need for a comprehensive impact study, specifically designed for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of LUC, taking into account its overall policy and development ecosystem. This will help to establish the achieved impact and inform a clear direction of its future interventions contributing to sustainable agriculture transformation agenda of Rwanda.

AB  - Current climate change policy and sustainable tourism goals require tourist accommodation to make substantial resource savings. This integrated energy and water systematic literature review analysed 110 key papers that contribute to understanding savings potentials and new opportunities. Findings identify substantial gaps that suggest that there is insufficient guidance on how to reduce resources and progress sustainability-oriented innovation. Benchmarks for energy and water were compiled alongside potential resource savings. Findings indicate opportunities for stronger collaborative effort particularly in areas of nonhotel accommodation, water savings, and guest behaviour, which are almost unstudied. A research framework to advance energy and water saving innovations is proposed.

AB  - The preservation of instream flows entails multiple benefits not only for river ecosystems but also for human well-being. Benefits of marketed goods and services provided by water withdrawals such as irrigation, water supply and hydropower production are well-known. Others, such as recreational, aesthetic, cultural and existence values of a well-preserved river flows are less studied. There is an increasing interest of policy makers to understand the benefits of costly river ecosystem restoration measures. Moreover, disregarding such benefits may turn into inter-stakeholder conflicts.
   This paper reviews empirically-based literature assessing environmental flows restoration/conservation. Thus, it offers the state-of-the-art on three aspects: 1) what motivations drive the socioeconomic evaluation of instream flows (policies and alternative instream flow regimes); 2) what values and benefits are associated with instream flows (e.g. the sheer existence of a well-preserved river, productive assets and cultural attributes); and 3) what methods are employed to undertake such assessments (e.g. scenario development, monetary and non-monetary valuations, and stakeholders engagement).
   Building on this, we propose a methodological framework for case-specific assessments of the restoration of environmental flows. This proposal combines increased stakeholder participation, better understanding of ecosystem functioning, awareness of the plurality of values and an accurate choice of valuation methods.

AB  - Climate change has caused vulnerability not only to the forest ecosystem but also to forest-dependent communities. Therefore, its management is essential to increase forest ecosystem services and reduce vulnerability to climate change using an integrated approach. Although many scientific studies examined climate change impact on forest ecosystems, forest vulnerability assessment, including forest sensitivity, adaptability, sustainability and effective management was found to be scant in the existing literature. Through a systematic review from 1990 to 2019, this paper examined forest vulnerability to climate change and its management practices. In this paper, descriptive, mechanism and thematic analyses were carried out to analyze the state of existing research, in order to understand the concept of vulnerability arising from climate change and forest management issues. The present study proposed a framework for integrated forest assessment and management for addressing such issues in future research. The conversion of forest land into other land uses, forest fragmentation, forest disturbance and the effects of climate change on the forest ecosystem are the existing problems. Forest vulnerability, effective adaptation to forest ecosystems and long-term sustainability are priority areas for future research. This study also calls for undertaking researchers at a local scale to involve communities for the effective management of forest ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundOrthopaedic surgery is the surgical specialty with the lowest proportion of women. Conflicting evidence regarding the potential challenges of pregnancy and parenthood in orthopaedics, such as the implications of delayed childbearing, may be a barrier to recruitment and retainment of women in orthopaedic surgery. A summary of studies is needed to ensure that women who have or wish to have children during their career in orthopaedic surgery are equipped with the relevant information to make informed decisions.Questions/purposesIn this systematic review, we asked: What are the key gender-related barriers pertaining to (1) family planning, (2) pregnancy, and (3) parenthood that women in orthopaedic surgery face?MethodsEmbase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO were searched on June 7, 2021, for studies related to pregnancy or parenthood as a woman in orthopaedic surgery. Inclusion criteria were studies in the English language and studies describing the perceptions or experiences of attending surgeons, trainees, or program directors. Studies that sampled surgical populations without specific reference to orthopaedics were excluded. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to identify important themes. Seventeen articles including surveys (13 studies), selective reviews (three studies), and an environmental scan (one study) met the inclusion criteria. The population sampled included 1691 attending surgeons, 864 trainees, and 391 program directors in the United States and United Kingdom. The Risk of Bias Instrument for Cross-Sectional Surveys of Attitudes and Practices tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in survey studies. A total of 2502 women and 560 men were sampled in 13 surveys addressing various topics related to pregnancy, parenthood, and family planning during an orthopaedic career. Three selective reviews provided information on occupational hazards in the orthopaedic work environment during pregnancy, while one environmental scan outlined the accessibility of parental leave policies at 160 residency programs. Many of the survey studies did not report formal clarity, validity, or reliability assessments, therefore increasing their risk of bias. However, our analysis of the provided instruments as well as the consistency of identified themes across multiple survey studies suggests the evidence we aggregated was sufficiently robust to answer the research questions posed in the current systematic review.ResultsThese data revealed that many women have witnessed or experienced discrimination related to pregnancy and parenthood, at times resulting in a decision to delay family planning. In one study, childbearing was reportedly delayed by 67% of respondents (304 of 452) because of their career choice in orthopaedics. Orthopaedic surgeons were more likely to experience pregnancy complications (range 24% to 31%) than the national mean in the United States (range 13% to 17%). Lastly, despite these challenging conditions, there was often limited support for women who had or wished to start a family during their orthopaedic surgery career. Maternity and parental leave policies varied across training institutions, and only 55% (56 of 102) of training programs in the United States offered parental leave beyond standard vacation time.ConclusionThe potential negative effects of these challenges on the orthopaedic gender gap can be mitigated by increasing the availability and accessibility of information related to family planning, parental leave, and return to clinical duties while working as a woman in orthopaedic surgery.
   Future research could seek to provide a more global perspective and specifically explore regional variation in the environment faced by pregnancy or parenting women in orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - Farm models are potentially relevant tools for policy impact assessment. Governments and international organizations use impact assessment (IA) as an ex-ante policy process and procedure to evaluate impacts of policy options as part of the introduction of new policies. IA is increasingly used. This paper reviews both the use of farm models in such policy lAs in the European Commission, and the development and use of farm models for policy IA by the scientific community over the past decade. A systematic review was performed, based on 202 studies from the period 2007-2015 and results were discussed in a science-policy workshop. Based on the literature review and the workshop, this paper describes progress in the development of farm models, challenges in their use in policy processes and a research and cooperation agenda. We conclude that main issues for a research agenda include: 1) better understanding of farmer decision-making and effects of the social milieu, with increased focus on the interactions between farmers and other actors, the link to the value chain, and farm structural change; 2) thorough and consistent model evaluation and model comparison, with increased attention for model sensitivity and uncertainty, and 3) the organization of a network of farm modellers. In addition, the agenda for science-policy cooperation emphasizes the need for: 4) synthesizing research evidence into systematic reviews as an institutional element in the existing science-policy-interfaces for agricultural systems, 5) improved and timely data collection, allowing to assess heterogeneity in farm objectives, management and indicators, and 6) stronger science-policy interaction, moving from a research-driven to a user-driven approach.

AB  - Change has been universally acknowledged as the perpetual theme for routine organizational life. As cultural tourism, a major element of global tourism consumption accounting for 40% of tourism employment, is becoming increasingly flourishing and promising, tourism organizations are also obliged to implement a series of organizational changes to adapt to the trending culturalization in the tourism domain. In light of this, this research, by outlining important sub-themes and trends of cultural tourism research, tracks the evolution of cultural tourism as a research field over the previous decades so as to analyze existing interconnections between the systematic review and tourism organizational change. Based on these interconnections, the research also manages to propose several potential implications for tourism organizations to optimize their future implement of daily organizational changes for the sake of adaptative survival and development.

AB  - The utilization of waste materials, as an energy resources, requires four main steps of production, pre-treatment, bio-refinery, and upgrading. This work reviews Machine Learning applications in the waste biomass production step. By investigating numerous related works, it is concluded that there is a considerable reviewing gap in the surveying and collecting the applications of Machine Learning in the waste biomass. To fill this gap with the current work, the kinds and resources of waste biomass as well as the role of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in their development are reviewed. Moreover, the storage and transportation of the wastes are surveyed followed by the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in these areas. Summarily, after analysis of numerous papers, it is concluded that Machine Learning and Deep Learning are widely utilized in waste biomass production areas to enhance the waste collecting quality and quality, improve the predictions, diminish the losses, as well as increase storage and transformation conditions.

AB  - Background: Salt marshes lie between many human communities and the coast and have been presumed to protect these communities from coastal hazards by providing important ecosystem services. However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.

AB  - Robots are heralded as part of a new revolution in agriculture. The agricultural robot's capacity to reduce working time or improve working conditions is often advanced as a major contribution to sustainable agriculture. But the transformations of work appear to be more complex. Here we review the transformations of work subsequent to adoption of agricultural robots on the farm. We carry out a systematic review of literature using a multidisciplinary analytical framework of transformations of work. We consider four dimensions of work: 1) farm structure and the labor market; 2) work organization; 3) meaning of work; and 4) technical-economic performances. Given that the deployment of robots in agriculture is still in its early stages, most of the studies concern the automated milking system (AMS). The transformations of agricultural work represent an emerging topic dominated by a technical and economic vision of work. The major points are as follows: Concerning farm structures, we find no evidence of a relationship between robotization and a certain farm size. Concerning the labor market, there is a risk of skill- and wage-related segmentation and exclusion. The AMS is an example of an in-depth re-organization of work with a decrease in the physical workload but which is concomitant with a new mental workload of monitoring alarms. Concerning the meaning of work with AMS, the changes in the animal-human relationship lead to the possibility of new identities and new self-perceptions by farmers and workers. There is no evidence to support a reduction in working time when an AMS is installed. Finally, a synthesis of the results allows us to propose a research agenda that can better orient future research to understand the diversity of transformations of work resulting from the adoption of robots in agriculture.

AB  - Background: Limited evidence exists regarding fitness-to-drive for people with the mental health conditions of schizophrenia, stress/anxiety disorder, depression, personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (herein simply referred to as ` mental health conditions'). The aim of this paper was to systematically search and classify all published studies regarding driving for this population, and then critically appraise papers addressing assessment of fitness-to-drive where the focus was not on the impact of medication on driving.
   Methods: A systematic search of three databases (CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE) was completed from inception to May 2016 to identify all articles on driving and mental health conditions. Papers meeting the eligibility criteria of including data relating to assessment of fitness-to-drive were critically appraised using the American Academy of Neurology and Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine protocols.
   Results: A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria of driving among people with mental health conditions studied, and of these, 16 contained data and an explicit focus on assessment of fitness-to-drive. Assessment of fitness-to-drive was reported in three ways: 1) factors impacting on the ability to drive safely among people with mental health conditions, 2) capability and perception of health professionals assessing fitness-to-drive of people with mental health conditions, and 3) crash rates. The level of evidence of the published studies was low due to the absence of controls, and the inability to pool data from different diagnostic groups. Evidence supporting fitness-to-drive is conflicting.
   Conclusions: There is a relatively small literature in the area of driving with mental health conditions, and the overall quality of studies examining fitness-to-drive is low. Large-scale longitudinal studies with age-matched controls are urgently needed in order to determine the effects of different conditions on fitness-to-drive.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found 42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23 observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs. rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban, suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface, and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species richness.

AB  - Across the energy sector, alternatives to fossil fuels are being developed, in response to the dual drivers of climate change and energy security. For transport, biofuels have the greatest potential to replace fossil fuels in the short-to medium term. However, the ecological benefits of biofuels and the role that their deployment can play in mitigating climate change are being called into question. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used approach that enables the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biofuel production to be calculated. Concerns have nevertheless been raised that published data show widely varying and sometimes contradictory results. This review describes a systematic review of GHG emissions and energy balance data from 44 LCA studies of first- and second-generation biofuels. The information collated was used to identify the dominant sources of GHG emissions and energy requirements in biofuel production and the key sources of variability in published LCA data. Our analysis revealed three distinct sources of variation: (1) 'real' variability in parameters e.g. cultivation; (2) 'methodological' variability due to the implementation of the LCA method; and (3) 'uncertainty' due to parameters rarely included and poorly quantified. There is global interest in developing a sustainability assessment protocol for biofuels. Confidence in the results of such an assessment can only be assured if these areas of uncertainty and variability are addressed. A more defined methodology is necessary in order to allow effective and accurate comparison of results. It is also essential that areas of uncertainty such as impacts on soil carbon stocks and fluxes are included in LCA assessments, and that further research is conducted to enable a robust calculation of impacts under different land-use change scenarios. Without the inclusion of these parameters, we cannot be certain that biofuels are really delivering GHG savings compared with fossil fuels.

Globally, the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) provides high priority for UHC as a health related goal. The National health system of Nepal has prioritized in similar way. The aim of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities on the road to UHC in Nepal.
   Method: We used varieties of search terminologies with popular search engines like PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, etc. to identify studies regarding Nepal's progress towards UHC. Reports of original studies, policies, guidelines and government manuals were taken from the web pages of Ministry of Health and its department/division. Searches were designed to identify the status of service coverage on UHC, financial protection on health particularly, health insurance coverage with its legal status. Other associated factors related to UHC were also explored and presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart.
   Results: We found 14 studies that were related to legal assurance, risk pulling and financing of health service, 11 studies associated to UHC service coverage status and, 7 articles linked to government stewardship, health system and governance on health care. Constitutional provision, global support, progress on the health insurance act, decentralization of health service to the grass root level, positive trends of increasing service coverage are seen as opportunities. However, existing volunteer types of health insurance, misleading role of trade unions and high proportion of population outside the country are main challenges. The political commitment under the changing political context, a sense of national priority and international support were identified as the facilitating factors towards UHC.
   Conclusion: To achieve UHC, service and population coverage of health services has to be expanded along with financial protection for marginalized communities. Government stewardship, support of stakeholders and fair contribution and distribution of resources by appropriate health financing modality can speed up the path of UHC in Nepal.

AB  - Background: Transport and its links to health and health inequalities suggest that it is important to assess both the direct and unintended indirect health and related impacts of transport initiatives and policies. Health Impact Assessment ( HIA) provides a framework to assess the possible health impacts of interventions such as transport. Policymakers and practitioners need access to well conducted research syntheses if research evidence is to be used to inform these assessments. The predictive validity of HIA depends heavily on the use and careful interpretation of supporting empirical evidence. Reviewing and digesting the vast volume and diversity of evidence in a field such as transport is likely to be beyond the scope of most HIAs. Collaborations between HIA practitioners and specialist reviewers to develop syntheses of best available evidence applied specifically to HIA could promote the use of evidence in practice.
   Methods: Best available research evidence was synthesised using the principles of systematic review. The synthesis was developed to reflect the needs of HIA practitioners and policymakers.
   Results: Aside from injury reduction measures, there is very little empirical data on the impact of road transport interventions. The possibility of impacts on a diverse range of outcomes and differential impacts across groups, make it difficult to assess overall benefit and harm. In addition, multiple mediating factors in the pathways between transport and hypothesised health impacts further complicate prospective assessment of impacts. Informed by the synthesis, a framework of questions was developed to help HIA practitioners identify the key questions which need to be considered in transport HIA.
   Conclusion: Principles of systematic review are valuable in producing syntheses of best available evidence for use in HIA practice. Assessment of the health impacts of transport interventions is characterised by much uncertainty, competing values, and differential or conflicting impacts for different population groups at a local or wider level. These are issues pertinent to the value of HIA generally. While uncertainty needs explicit acknowledgement in HIA, there is still scope for best available evidence to inform the development of healthy public policy.

AB  - Climate security is a burgeoning focus of the multidisciplinary literatures investigating the impacts from climate change. This research theme has gained prominence due to the realisation that climatic changes will likely compromise human welfare and community stability, with significant implications for governments' security agendas. The Indo-Pacific region is an important case study for understanding climate security given its ongoing environmental and developmental challenges and the cultural, political and economic tensions existing within and between neighbouring countries. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of academic and "grey" literatures that address climate adaptation, disaster management or regional security in the Indo-Pacific. From this review, we identify four key themes that arise prominently in discussion and analysis prepared by academic scholars, governments and non-government organisations alike. The ubiquity of these themes speaks to the interdependent nature of the adaptation, disaster management and security challenges. The literature is in agreement that maintaining and enhancing climate security in the Indo-Pacific will depend on the region's capacity to strategically coordinate between the activities of governments, industry and communities; the willingness of governments to meaningfully cooperate with communities and each other despite existing tensions; governments' ability to manage limited resources efficiently; and their capacity to identify and address climate-maladaptive path dependencies. We highlight the most popular prescriptions for addressing these concurrent challenges at the current time. We argue that these prescriptions warrant further research and will likely have broader applicability for addressing climate security challenges in other regions of the world.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scars (HTS) are a source of morbidity for burn survivors and can present with a range of lifestyle-limiting problems. These include pruritus, pain, burning, stiffness, and contractures. Many solutions have been developed, but few have been studied in the form of a prospective, randomized control trial (RCT). Given the importance these RCTs carry in shaping the treatment of burn patients, we sought to systematically and critically review this portion of the burn literature.
   Methods: PubMed was used to perform 2 separate searches with limits that included Humans, English, and Randomized Controlled Trial. A keyword search using "hypertrophic," "Scar," "burn," and "treatment" was cross-referenced with a MeSH subject-heading search using "Cicatrix, Hypertrophic" AND "Burn." Studies were then reviewed and excluded if they did not address management of burn HTS in the non-acute setting.
   Results: Two literature searches resulted in a total of 32 articles. Twelve articles were excluded because they were not relevant to the topic (n = 10) or could not be obtained (n = 2). The remaining 20 articles contained 882 patients treated for hypertrophic scars. Breakdown based on topics included laser therapy (58 patients, 2 articles), silicone gel (204 patients, 7 articles), compression garment (236 patients, 4 articles), silicone + pressure (226 patients, 3 articles), topical emollients (58 patients, 2 articles), systemic therapy (62 patients, 1 article), intralesional therapy (18 patients, 1 article), and surgical treatment (20 patients, 1 article). While some articles had favorable conclusions (laser, emollients, surgical, and intralesional therapy) or unfavorable conclusions (systemic therapy), there were conflicting results on silicone and/or compression.
   Conclusions: Despite hypertrophic scars being a common occurrence in burn survivors, both the number of studies and consensus for treatment are limited. Efforts to perform larger, adequately powered RCTs are needed, specifically in the areas of silicone, compression garments, and combination therapy.

AB  - Infrastructure for active travel (AT) is receiving attention as a low-cost, sustainable transport option that promotes physical activity. However, the planning and implementation of new AT infrastructure often brings challenges. This review synthesises stakeholders' views and experiences of developing guidance for, designing, commissioning and implementing environmental interventions to promote AT. Eight databases were searched for studies containing qualitative data from stakeholders with direct experience. Results were synthesised thematically. The risk of bias was assessed using the CASP checklist for qualitative research, and evidence quality using the GRADE-CERQual tool. A total of 21,703 articles were identified from database searches, with 35 studies included. Eighteen studies focused on infrastructure promoting walking and cycling, fourteen on cycling and three on walking. Fifteen studies were judged to have no/very minor concerns, 12 had minor concerns, four had moderate concerns and four were of serious concern. A variety of stakeholders were influential, most commonly supportive elected leaders and individuals in public and voluntary sectors. Inter-disciplinary collaboration facilitated sharing of expertise and resources, and upskilling was beneficial. Effective communication methods varied between stakeholders and reason for communication. Persuasive strategies included aligning with stakeholders priorities and making the best use of evidence. Opportune moments to implement AT infrastructure were alongside non-AT projects and exogenous events. Compliance with AT policies could increase by embedding in higher level legislation. Political support was important and fostered through not de-prioritising cars and gaining external funding. The GRADE-CERQual found high confidence in our findings, apart from the sub-themes "Methods of communication" and "Political will" that had moderate confidence. Our findings can assist stakeholders in successfully navigating the process from conception to implementation of AT infrastructure and inform future policy and decision-making.

AB  - Contested heritage has increasingly been studied by scholars over the last two decades in multiple disciplines, however, there is still limited knowledge about what contested heritage is and how it is realized in society. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to produce a systematic literature review on this topic to provide a holistic understanding of contested heritage, and delineate its current state, trends and gaps. Methodologically, four electronic databases were searched, and 102 journal articles published before 2020 were extracted. A content analysis of each article was then conducted to identify key themes and variables for classification. Findings show that while its research often lacks theoretical underpinnings, contested heritage is marked by its diversity and complexity as it becomes a global issue for both tourism and urbanization. By presenting a holistic understanding of contested heritage, this review offers an extensive investigation of the topic area to help move literature pertaining contested heritage forward.

AB  - Food production is a major driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water and land use, and dietary risk factors are contributors to non-communicable diseases. Shifts in dietary patterns can therefore potentially provide benefits for both the environment and health. However, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of these impacts, and the dietary changes necessary to achieve them. We systematically review the evidence on changes in GHG emissions, land use, and water use, from shifting current dietary intakes to environmentally sustainable dietary patterns. We find 14 common sustainable dietary patterns across reviewed studies, with reductions as high as 70-80% of GHG emissions and land use, and 50% of water use (with medians of about 20-30% for these indicators across all studies) possible by adopting sustainable dietary patterns. Reductions in environmental footprints were generally proportional to the magnitude of animal-based food restriction. Dietary shifts also yielded modest benefits in all-cause mortality risk. Our review reveals that environmental and health benefits are possible by shifting current Western diets to a variety of more sustainable dietary patterns.

AB  - Solar energy is one of the leading renewable energy sources in terms of installed power capacity on a global scale. Scientific research on the site-selection procedures of solar photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies is of significant importance, contributing to environmen-tally sustainable, technically and economically viable, and socially acceptable solar energy projects. This systematic review provides direct analysis and assessment of existing site-selection procedures and addresses a gap in knowledge in the solar energy research. Among a total of 10,121 scientific studies filtered and investigated, a total of 152 scientific studies were identified as eligible and reviewed in detail. Each selected study was further investigated through 11 key thematic modules: (1) site-selection methodologies; (2) type, number, and exclusion limits of exclusion criteria; (3) type, number, importance, priority, and suitability classes of assessment criteria; (4) optimization modules and criteria; (5) studies' geographic locations; (6) spatial planning or reference scales; (7) solar radiation data estimation and analysis; (8) sensitivity analysis related to site-selection procedure; (9) participatory planning approaches, groups, and contributions; (10) laws, regulations, and policies related to site-selection procedure; (11) suitability indexes (linguistic or/and numeric) and ranking procedures. Important insights and useful data trends are identified and highlighted in these key thematic modules of site-selection issue, enhancing future studies and globally improving siting implementations. @2023 The Authors published by Elsevier ltd This is an open access article under the CC BY licnese

AB  - In the effort to urgently develop new and improved methodologies to compute and assess CO2 emissions from transportation, results have been less than ideal; this article provides a review of the methodologies currently available. When it comes to the discharge of harmful gases into the air, transportation is the biggest offender. Methods are still being developed to calculate and analyze the transportation sector's carbon footprint, despite the fact that the need to limit the emission of gases that contribute to global warming has now become urgent. Previous studies have calculated the carbon footprint of transportation; however, there are some discrepancies in the terminology and methodologies utilized. The commonalities between CO2 emission measurement techniques and assessment techniques are the primary subject of this review. This study helps to increase public awareness of environmental concerns and promotes the use of reliable methodologies for calculating transportation-related CO2 emissions. It is hoped that choosing the optimal available method will contribute to a decrease in CO2 emissions from transportation.

AB  - With the rapid development of climate change adaptation over recent decades, a considerable amount of evidence has been collected on maladaptation associated with climate change adaptation initiatives, particularly in terms of risk transfer and risk substitution. Increasing our understanding of maladaptation is important for avoiding negative outcomes of adaptation project implementation. However, maladaptation has received limited research attention. Previous research has focused on frameworks that can assist in defining and avoiding maladaptive risk and be applied to adaptation initiative planning processes. Adaptation may cause more significant influences on spatial land change than the direct effect of climate change does. Identifying the adaptation consequences that are likely to result in maladaptation is crucial. A combination of spatial land analysis and climate change analysis can be used for the aforementioned identification. However, empirical case studies on methods that can assess and evaluate the risk of maladaptation by integrating spatial and temporal aspects in a land spatial modeling tool have not been conducted. The present study aimed to fill this research gap by exploring the existing knowledge on maladaptation to climate change. We examined the interaction among spatial analysis, evaluated maladaptation frameworks, and project design to extend our conceptual understanding on maladaptation to climate change. We adopted a systematic review method that involved considering several questions including the following: (a) What are the definitions and categories of maladaptation? (b) What methods and theoretical frameworks exist for the assessment and evaluation of maladaptive risk? (c) How have climate-related research communities considered issues of maladaptation? (d) What are the experimental studies on land use change that can be referred to for minimizing maladaptive risks in future adaptation planning? In conclusion, further research on maladaptation should integrate spatial land analysis methods to facilitate the identification and avoidance of maladaptive risk in the initial stage of adaptation planning.

AB  - Given the rapid pace of population growth, urbanization and hence construction and development, businesses within the built environment industry play a critical role in ensuring a more sustainable future. Transformative and innovative changes in how neighbourhoods, districts or even cities will be designed, planned and built to meet mounting social and environmental concerns is critical, and yet our understanding of the role of the business sector in sustainable urban development (SUD) remains elusive. To address this issue, we have engaged in a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on business and SUD, presenting a synthesis of our findings, an evidence-based theoretical model and an outline of our contributions to the sustainability literature.

AB  - Child mortality is the lowest it has ever been, but the burden of death in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is still prevalent, and the numbers average above the global mean. Breastfeeding contributes to the reduction of child mortality by improving chance of survival beyond childhood. Therefore, it is essential to examine how evidence-based breastfeeding interventions are being maintained in resource-constrained settings. Guided by Scheirer and Dearing's sustainability framework, the aim of this systematic review was to explore how evidence-based breastfeeding interventions implemented to address child mortality in LMICs are sustained. The literature search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of breastfeeding interventions from the following electronic databases: Cochrane Library, Global Health, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Literature selection and data extraction were completed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A narrative synthesis was used to investigate factors that contributed to sustainability failure or success. A total of 497 articles were identified through the database search. Only three papers were included in the review after the removal of duplicates and assessment for eligibility. The three RCTs included breastfeeding interventions predominately focusing on breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in rural, semi-rural, and peri-urban areas in South Africa, Kenya, and India. The number of women included in the studies ranged from 901 to 3,890, and the duration of studies stretched from 6 weeks to 2.5 years. In two studies, sustainability was reported as the continuation of the intervention, and the other study outlined program dissemination and scale-up. Facilitators and barriers that influenced the sustainability of breastfeeding interventions were largely related to specific characteristics of the interventions (i.e., strong intervention implementers-facilitator; small number of CHWs involved-barrier). Optimizing the sustainability of breastfeeding interventions in LMICs is imperative to reduce child mortality. The focal point of implementation must be planning for sustainability to lead to continued benefits and changes in population outcomes. A defined action plan for sustainability needs to be included in both funding and research.

AB  - The intelligent age and smart culture era provide a new environment where everything, including artifacts, is tagged with devices to capture and provide the required information. Organizations, game designers, educators and other stakeholders can utilize these technological opportunities to create extreme immersive and interactive experiences. They look forward to examining the combination of new methods and tools during in-site or outdoor visits, in order to intrigue and attract visitors and provide opportunities to experience emotional involvement and dominance feelings. Alike cities, heritage sectors all over the world envision to connect artifacts and other objects, so to urge smartness in their environments, and integrate Internet of Things (IoT) and other technologies, in order to uplift visitor's involvement and interest for cultural collections. In addition, serious games development and their evolution enhance mental or physical engagement and broaden knowledge and skills in an entertaining and exciting way. This paper presents a systematic review that focuses on the use of escape rooms in the context of serious games, in museums or other places of cultural interest. Technological tools, platforms, tangible or digital objects, IoT elements, evaluation methods and their results and limitations are organized and mapped through a number of literature publications over the last 5 years. Seven qualified studies fulfilled specific criteria and PRISMA have been used as a guideline. The analysis indicates that IoT-escape room type of games can provide an enjoyable experience and immerse visitors as active learners who creatively use unknown tools, decision-making, communication and critical thinking during their play in a cultural/historic environment. These games refer to any type of visitor's group, affect traffic time and uplift cultural interest. Apart from that, they are also important to anyone who desires to promote and create motivational projects with cultural content using the escape room game mechanics and IoT elements. To the best of our knowledge, this review is among the first to provide a structured study with closely considered data collection and analysis.

AB  - Climate change can affect species distribution patterns in three different ways: pushing them to disperse to new suitable areas, forcing them to adapt to novel climatic conditions, or driving them to extinction. However, the biological and geographical traits that lead to these different responses remain poorly explored. Here, we evaluated how ecological and biogeographic traits influence amphibians' response to climate change. We performed a systematic review searching for studies that evaluated the effects of future climate change on amphibian's distribution. Our research returned 31 articles that projected the distribution of 331 amphibians. Our results demonstrate that species inhabiting an elevation above 515 m will lose a significant portion of their climatically suitable area. We also found that as isothermality increases, the amount of area suitable in response to climate change also increases. Another important discovery was that as the size of the baseline area increases, the greater must be the loss of climatically suitable areas. On the other hand, species with very small areas tend to keep their current climatically suitable area in the future. Furthermore, our results indicate that species that inhabit dry habitats tend to expand their suitable area in response to climate change. This result can be explained by the environmental characteristics of these habitats, which tend to present extreme seasonal climates with well-defined periods of drought and rain. We also found that anurans that inhabit exclusively forests are projected to lose a greater portion of their suitable areas, when compared to species that inhabit both forest and open areas, wetlands, and dry and rupestrian environments. The biogeographical realm also influenced anuran's range shifts, with Afrotropic and Nearctic species projected to expand their geographical ranges. The assessment of climate change effects on amphibian distribution has been the focus of a growing number of studies. Despite this, some regions and species remain underrepresented. Current literature evaluates about 4% of the 7,477 species of Anura and 8% of the 773 species of Caudata and some regions rich in amphibian species remain severely underrepresented, such as Madagascar. Thus, future studies should focus on regions and taxas that remain underrepresented.

AB  - Ecotoxicology evolved as a scientific field as awareness of the unintended effects of anthropogenic pollutants in biota increased. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are often the focus of Arctic contaminant exposure studies because they are apex predators with high contaminant loads. While early studies focused on describing and quantifying pollutants, present-day polar bear toxicological papers often incorporate ecological variables. This systematic literature review investigates the ecological and physiological variables that have been integrated in such studies. The systematic literature search resulted in 207 papers, published between 1970 and 2016. Representation of each of the 19 polar bear subpopulations varied from 0 to 72 papers; East Greenland, Barents Sea, Southern Beaufort Sea, and Lancaster Sound had the most published research, with over 30 papers each. Samples were collected between 1881 and 2015, primarily from harvested bears (66%); most from the 1990s and 2000s. Adipose tissue, liver, and blood were the most common tissues examined, and mean number of bears analyzed per paper was 76 (range 1-691). Papers investigating temporal trends did so using a mean sample of 61 bears over a 6-year period. The frequency with which ecological and physiological variables were integrated into toxicological papers varied. Age and (or) sex was the only ecological variable(s) considered in 51% of papers. Further, a total of 37% of the papers included in the review investigated physiological effects in relation to contaminant concentrations. Of the papers, 98% dealt with contaminant exposure at the individual level, leaving population level effects largely unstudied. Solitary subadult and adult polar bears were included in 57% and 79% of the papers, respectively. Younger bears were included in fewer papers: yearlings in 20% and cubs-of-the-year in 13%. Only 12% of the papers examined reproduction relative to contaminants. Finally, body condition was included in 26% of the research papers, whereas variables related to polar bear diet were included in <= 9%. Based on our findings, we suggest future polar bear toxicology studies increase sample sizes, include more ecological variables, increase studies on family groups, and increase the applicability of studies to management and conservation by examining pollution effects on reproduction and survival.

AB  - Background: Competition for freshwater between cities and agriculture is projected to grow due to rapid urbanization, particularly in the Global South. Water reallocation from rural to urban regions has become a common strategy to meet freshwater needs in growing cities. Conceptual issues and associated measurement problems have impeded efforts to compare and learn from global experiences. This review examines the status and trends of water reallocation from rural to urban regions based on academic literature and policy documents.
   Methods: We conduct a systematic literature review to establish the global reallocation database (GRaD). This process yielded 97 published studies (academic and policy) on rural-to-urban reallocation. We introduce the concept of reallocation 'dyads' as the unit of analysis to describe the pair of a recipient (urban) and donor (rural) region. A coding framework was developed iteratively to classify the drivers, processes and outcomes of water reallocation from a political economy perspective.
   Results: The systematic review identified 69 urban agglomerations receiving water through 103 reallocation projects (dyads). Together these reallocation dyads involve approximately 16 billion m(3) of water per year moving almost 13 000 kilometres to urban recipient regions with an estimated 2015 population of 383 million. Documented water reallocation dyads are concentrated in North America and Asia with the latter constituting the majority of dyads implemented since 2000.
   Synthesis: The analysis illustrates how supply and demand interact to drive water reallocation projects, which can take many forms, although collective negotiation and administrative decisions are most prevalent. Yet it also reveals potential biases and gaps in coverage for parts of the Global South (particularly in South America and Africa), where reallocation (a) can involve informal processes that are difficult to track and (b) receives limited coverage by the English-language literature covered by the review. Data regarding the impacts on the donor region and compensation are also limited, constraining evidence to assess whether a water reallocation project is truly effective, equitable and sustainable. We identify frameworks and metrics for assessing reallocation projects and navigating the associated trade-offs by drawing on the concept of benefit sharing.

AB  - Introduction: Perceptions of the physical environment influence adolescents' active transport. However, it is unclear which characteristics of the environment are most important for adolescents' active transport and whether parents' and adolescents' perceptions influence their active transport behavior differently. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the relationship between physical environment perceptions and active transport in adolescents. Methods: A systematic search from May 2008 to March 2022 was conducted in seven databases. Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers using the open-source machine learning software "ASReview". An effect direction plot was created to find overall effects between studies and a narrative synthesis was conducted to highlight differential aspects within studies. Study quality was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. Results: Fifty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Shorter perceived distance was consistently associated with more active transport. Possible associations between active transport and traffic and general safety, walking and cycling infrastructure, aesthetics, street connectivity, and mixed or summary environment scores were found. In studies assessing both parents' and adolescents' perceptions, associations between perceived environment and active transport differed by survey group (adolescents/parents). Regarding gender differences, accessible destinations may be more important for boys while safe walking and cycling infrastructure may be more important for girls. Conclusions: The findings, although limited mostly to cross-sectional studies conducted in single cities or districts, help to understand the relation between the environment and active transport from an adolescent perspective. Short distances, appropriate and safe walking and cycling infrastructure, and aesthetic surroundings are important for adolescents' active transport. When designing active transport-friendly neighborhoods, different perceptions of adolescents and their parents, boys and girls should be considered.

AB  - Introduction: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complex disease with multiple aetiological factors, wide ranging severity, and multiple challenges to effective triage and management. Databases, data mining and machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including artificial neural networks (ANNs), may assist by storing and interpreting data from multiple sources, potentially improving clinical decision-making.
   Aims: 1) Identify database technologies used to store AP data, 2) collate and categorise variables stored in AP databases, 3) identify the MLA technologies, including ANNs, used to analyse AP data, and 4) identify clinical and non-clinical benefits and obstacles in establishing a national or international AP database.
   Methods: Comprehensive systematic search of online reference databases. The predetermined inclusion criteria were all papers discussing 1) databases, 2) data mining or 3) MLAs, pertaining to AP, independently assessed by two reviewers with conflicts resolved by a third author.
   Results: Forty-three papers were included. Three data mining technologies and five ANN methodologies were reported in the literature. There were 187 collected variables identified. ANNs increase accuracy of severity prediction, one study showed ANNs had a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.96 six hours after admission - compare APACHE II (cutoff score >= 8) with 0.80 and 0.85 respectively. Problems with databases were incomplete data, lack of clinical data, diagnostic reliability and missing clinical data.
   Conclusion: This is the first systematic review examining the use of databases, MLAs and ANNs in the management of AP. The clinical benefits these technologies have over current systems and other advantages to adopting them are identified. Copyright (C) 2013, IAP and EPC.

AB  - Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater, supporting the livelihood of over two billion people worldwide. The quantitative assessment of groundwater resources is critical for sustainable management of this strained resource, particularly as climate warming, population growth, and socioeconomic development further press the water resources. Rapid growth in the availability of a plethora of in-situ and remotely sensed data alongside advancements in data-driven methods and machine learning offer immense opportunities for an improved assessment of groundwater resources at the local to global levels. This systematic review documents the advancements in this field and evaluates the accuracy of various models, following the protocol developed by the Center for Evidence-Based Conservation. A total of 197 original peer-reviewed articles from 2010-2020 and from 28 countries that employ regression machine learning algorithms for groundwater monitoring or prediction are analyzed and their results are aggregated through a meta-analysis. Our analysis points to the capability of machine learning models to monitor/predict different characteristics of groundwater resources effectively and efficiently. Modeling the groundwater level is the most popular application of machine learning models, and the groundwater level in previous time steps is the most employed input data. The feed-forward artificial neural network is the most employed and accurate model, although the model performance does not exhibit a striking dependence on the model choice, but rather the information content of the input variables. Around 10-12 years of data are required to develop an acceptable machine learning model with a monthly temporal resolution. Finally, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms and computational advancements to merge them with physics-based models offer unprecedented opportunities to employ new information, e.g., InSAR data, for increased spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of groundwater monitoring and prediction.

AB  - The Tana-Beles sub-basin, a strategic economic growth corridor in Ethiopia, relies on water storage to provide a suite of key services to agriculture, drinking water supply, energy, and ecosystems. While there are a range of storage options (e.g., from large dams to subsurface aquifers) that can be utilized to provide these services, a systematic stock-take of literature on water storage in the Tana-Beles has not been undertaken. This knowledge gap constrains the identification of the relative contribution of different storage types in the Tana-Beles. Accordingly, in this study, we conducted a systematic review of literature on the surface and sub-surface storages to examine key issues of the different storage types and their linkages in the Tana-Beles sub-basin. Peer-reviewed and grey publications from various databases were considered for the systematic review. The results indicate that literature in the Tana-Beles sub-basin is more focused on natural storage like wetlands and Lake Tana than built storage types like human-made reservoirs. Overall, the analysis revealed three key points. First, storage volume and water quality in those storages are declining. Second, the causal factors for storage loss and water quality deterioration are agricultural expansion, land degradation, sedimentation, and increasing water withdrawals. Third, the storage gap will increase because of climate change, population, and economic growth while current management options are fragmented. Therefore, the need for more integrated nexus approaches is paramount to optimize storage resources in water, food, energy, and ecosystems in light of population-driven growth in demand and the ongoing global climate crisis.

AB  - Gender inequality is one of the main drivers of food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa, as it is the main threat to the agricultural production activities of women due to climate change. The interplay between gender and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change especially on agriculture and food security in Nigeria is poorly documented. Through a systematic review, this paper investigated the interplay between gender and the impact of climate change vulnerability on agriculture and food security in Nigeria. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA approach. The results document that gender issues are poorly addressed in research on vulnerability to climate change impacts on agriculture with implications for food security in Nigeria. More importantly, the existing studies are limited in number with little focus on food security in relation to vulnerability. Moreover, the majority of these studies conceptualized gender in terms of two sexes: male and female. Only a few studies have considered gender as the socio-cultural roles played by men and women. Findings also indicated that women are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change impacts on agriculture and food security than men. Besides, several factors have contributed to these gender inequalities including education, age, access to land etc. Gaps in gender research include the limited gender studies in the Northern region of the country, the little conceptualization of gender as the sociocultural roles of men and women with regards to the vulnerability to climate change impact on agriculture and food security; the long-term impacts of vulnerability to climate change on social cohesion in rural households and the sustainability of strategies to reduce rural women's vulnerability.

AB  - As the interest in new, natural, sustainable products arises in many fields, wild plants are reconsidered as providers of traditional or innovative applications. The notion of ecosystem services (ES) provides a frame to evaluate their benefits, but is still scarcely applied to endemic floras. The present study reviews the available literature on the ES provided by the 494 taxa endemic to Greece that are present in Peloponnese. Six main categories are isolated: medical, aromatic, folk medicine, antimicrobial, environmental and craftsmanship interests. The literature documents such ES for 24.7% of the endemic taxa, with Lamiaceae, Asteraceae and Boraginaceae as the families with the highest numbers of documented taxa. Spatial hotspots with a high density in taxa providing ES are mapped, while gaps of knowledge on the ES of endemic taxa are highlighted. For the first time, to our knowledge, taxonomic and phylogenetic bounds between taxa are exploited as a base to explore potential properties for endemic taxa. The basis for the development of predictive tools utilizing literature review datasets is set. Final outcomes also provide robust scientific evidence to support decision and policy making for the sustainable use and management of rural areas. The development of cultivation areas for threatened taxa of interest is suggested as a potent conservation measure, by selecting fields according to habitat suitability models.

For this purpose, through the bibliometric analysis, a sample of 755 articles extracted from the web of science and elsevier scopus databases were analyzed. The ten most relevant documents in terms of citation were analyzed in a qualitative manner. As results, it was observed that the economies developed concentrate the publications, as well as they are object of study in a great part of the articles. In addition, few studies explore a sample involving companies from under-developed or developing countries. Therefore, there is a need for studies that have as research objects developing economy companies and that consider the specific economic, social and environmental characteristics of these regions.

AB  - The building energy (BE) management plays an essential role in urban sustainability and smart cities. Recently, the novel data science and data-driven technologies have shown significant progress in analyzing the energy consumption and energy demand datasets for a smarter energy management. The machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods and applications, in particular, have been promising for the advancement of accurate and high-performance energy models. The present study provides a comprehensive review of ML- and DL-based techniques applied for handling BE systems, and it further evaluates the performance of these techniques. Through a systematic review and a comprehensive taxonomy, the advances of ML and DL-based techniques are carefully investigated, and the promising models are introduced. According to the results obtained for energy demand forecasting, the hybrid and ensemble methods are located in the high-robustness range, SVM-based methods are located in good robustness limitation, ANN-based methods are located in medium-robustness limitation, and linear regression models are located in low-robustness limitations. On the other hand, for energy consumption forecasting, DL-based, hybrid, and ensemble-based models provided the highest robustness score. ANN, SVM, and single ML models provided good and medium robustness, and LR-based models provided a lower robustness score. In addition, for energy load forecasting, LR-based models provided the lower robustness score. The hybrid and ensemble-based models provided a higher robustness score. The DL-based and SVM-based techniques provided a good robustness score, and ANN-based techniques provided a medium robustness score.

AB  - Background: Malaria still causes high morbidity and mortality around the world, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Community case management of malaria (CCMm) by community health workers (CHWs) is one of the strategies to combat the disease by increasing access to malaria treatment. Currently, the World Health Organization recommends to treat only confirmed malaria cases, rather than to give presumptive treatment.
   Objectives: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the success or failure of critical steps in CCMm with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
   Methods: The databases of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the library of the 'Malaria in Pregnancy' consortium, and Web of Science were used to find studies on CCMm with RDTs in SSA. Studies were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, subsequently risk of bias was assessed and data extracted.
   Results: 27 articles were included. CHWs were able to correctly perform RDTs, although specificity levels were variable. CHWs showed high adherence to test results, but in some studies a substantial group of RDT negatives received treatment. High risk of bias was found for morbidity and mortality studies, therefore, effects on morbidity and mortality could not be estimated. Uptake and acceptance by the community was high, however negative-tested patients did not always follow up referral advice. Drug or RDT stock-outs and limited information on CHW motivation are bottlenecks for sustainable implementation. RDT-based CCMm was found to be cost effective for the correct treatment of malaria in areas with low to medium malaria prevalence, but study designs were not optimal.
   Discussion: Trained CHWs can deliver high quality care for malaria using RDTs. However, lower RDT specificity could lead to missed diagnoses of non-malarial causes of fever. Other threats for CCMm are non-adherence to negative test results and low referral completion. Integrated CCM may solve some of these issues. Unfortunately, morbidity and mortality are not adequately investigated. More information is needed about influencing sociocultural aspects, CHW motivation and stock supply.
   Conclusion: CCMm is generally well executed by CHWs, but there are several barriers for its success. Integrated CCM may overcome some of these barriers.

AB  - Cities' high traffic concentration, fast technological change, resource scarcity and growing environmental con-cerns accentuate competing tensions between stakeholders, transport modes and policies in the mobility sector. Tensions become even more salient in shared mobility - a complex yet relatively new phenomenon at the intersection between sharing economy and the transport sector - and raise numerous concerns for meeting sustainability objectives. The purpose of this paper is to identify conflicting demands associated with shared mobility by conducting a systematic literature review. Our results reveal several contradictions related to shared mobility and sustainability goals, and relations between those constantly evolving in a dynamic fashion. Thus, although shared mobility represents a step forward in achieving sustainability in theory, in practice, this task is only partially completed due to existing inherent contradictions. A paradox perspective on shared mobility, proposed in this paper, provides grounds for revisiting policy actions and finding workable solutions for practitioners.

AB  - Selection and implementation of effective and efficient waste management strategies have been widely considered as a matter of concern for sustainable development. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the most common approach to evaluate the environmental impacts of different waste management strategies. This paper presents a systematic review of scientific LCA studies assessing environmental impacts of waste to energy (WtE) technologies. A systematic literature review protocol was followed to characterise and critically evaluate the published literature on the environmental dimensions of LCA studies for WtE from 1981 to 2019 in terms of software, databases, life cycle impact assessment methods, environmental impacts and source of uncertainty. The major research observations were summarised accordingly, and important insights were obtained in the current review. The results showed that the treatment of specific waste material with various WtE technologies can affect different environmental impact categories in a contradictory way. For instance, anaerobic digestion can minimise environmental consequences dealing with organic wastes in the majority of impact categories but not in ecotoxicity and human toxicity impact categories. There was a general agreement in the results about the preference of incineration over landfilling for MSW treatment. Moreover, the results of sensitivity analysis showed that assumptions in substitution of WtE products are the primary source of uncertainty. Overall, the results of LCA studies confirm the application of WtE technologies in an integrated waste management strategy. In addition, the discussion in the article provides insights on technologies suitable for each waste material.

AB  - As the mapping and assessment of ecosystem services (MAES) becomes a widely used tool in environmental governance, there is an increasing need for structure and standardization. In this study we present a systematic review of European MAES studies focussing on two important, but rarely documented aspects of ecosystem service (ES) indicators: (1) their 'position' with respect to the ecosystem service cascade model, and (2) their 'position' in geographical space, i.e. whether the maps are 'anchored' at the locations of their supply or their demand.
   From the 82 papers reviewed we found 427 ES indicators, which represented 33 ES. Among these indicators there were 108 (25%) that were mapped. ES are quite different in terms of their relationship with the main conceptual model of ES assessment studies. Most ES are typically measured at a specific point in the cascade, which is more or less the same across the different studies. While some ES (including most of the regulating ES, e.g. bio-remediation, hydrological cycle maintenance, or soil fertility) can clearly be linked to the 'natural' endpoint of the cascade, some others (including all cultural and some provisioning ES, like cultivated crops, or wild animals) are more frequently measured as actual flows or benefits delivered to humanity. There are few ES that are markedly heterogeneous in their cascade levels (e.g. water provision, pest control) for which apparently different assessment approaches exist.
   Considering spatial anchor, we have found that mapping at the source predominates in ES mapping studies: 91% of the mapped indicators are clearly linked to the source ecosystems. There were relatively few studies that applied a mixed approach, whereas indicators clearly anchored at beneficiaries were extremely rare.
   These two aspects of ES indicators discussed in this paper are critical in the successful operationalization and standardization of MAES assessments, which have been neglected in the MAES literature so far, which might be seen as key components in the future standardization of mapping and assessment approaches.

AB  - Studies of automobile accident frequency among drivers with AD have yielded conflicting results about the risk of accidents. To develop a practice parameter regarding driving and AD the authors performed a systematic review of the literature. The authors identified well-designed, controlled studies of driving and AD using the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database. The authors also compared the relative rates of crashes and other performance measurements of driving ability in the populations studied. Driving was found to be mildly impaired in those drivers with probable AD at a severity of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5. This impairment was no greater than that tolerated in other segments of the driving population (e.g., drivers age 16 to 21 and those driving under the influence of alcohol at a blood alcohol concentration [BAC] < 0.08%). Drivers with AD at a severity of CDR 1 were found to pose a significant traffic safety problem both from crashes and from driving performance measurements.

AB  - This paper aims to explore effective ways to incorporate a mission-orientated framework to innovation policies that are designed to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper aims to identify the strategies of MOIP to inform innovation and sustainability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, particularly focusing on the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) context. It does so through a systematic literature review of current studies related to MOIP, according to the PRISMA protocol, regarding countries in the GCC region that are currently undergoing ambitious national strategic development plans with sustainability and inclusive growth at their core. This particularly targets SDG 9, which is about fostering innovation that is inclusive and sustainable. Implications for this study may inform innovation policy in the GCC and even inspire the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in terms of innovation metrics, energy transitions, the innovation ecosystem, public participation, and policy implementation and evaluation. Based on the systematic review and current innovation ecosystems and practices in the GCC, recommendations and strategic options are outlined.

AB  - Resilience thinking has been widely used as a tool for interdisciplinary studies in addressing disturbance and change. However, not many studies have been taken to synthesize resilience as an interdisciplinary concept being applied across different disciplines and to investigate the common issues among them. This paper explores a conceptual framework for resilience research in an interdisciplinary perspective. In doing so, we first illustrate the academic landscape for resilience research according to the citation network of publications. After that, we categorize resilience studies into ten core research domains by their inner citation relationships. And then, we propose a framework which synthesizes principles of resilience from different research fields embracing key components (behaviors, capacities, influencing factors, interventions, and system dynamics). Based on four theoretical features-conceptions, characteristics, influencing factors, and intervention strategies, we extract key points from each domain. As resilience is a creative theory for sustainability science, this study is expected to contribute to sustainability science by generalizing resilience as an interdisciplinary concept.

AB  - Provision of reproductive health ( RH) services is a minimum standard of health care in humanitarian settings; however access to these services is often limited. This systematic review, one component of a global evaluation of RH in humanitarian settings, sought to explore the evidence regarding RH services provided in humanitarian settings and to determine if programs are being evaluated. In addition, the review explored which RH services receive more attention based on program evaluations and descriptive data. Peer-reviewed papers published between 2004 and 2013 were identified via the Ovid MEDLINE database, followed by a PubMed search. Papers on quantitative evaluations of RH programs, including experimental and non-experimental designs that reported outcome data, implemented in conflict and natural disaster settings, were included. Of 5,669 papers identified in the initial search, 36 papers describing 30 programs met inclusion criteria. Twenty-five papers described programs in sub-Saharan Africa, six in Asia, two in Haiti and three reported data from multiple countries. Some RH technical areas were better represented than others: seven papers reported on maternal and newborn health (including two that also covered family planning), six on family planning, three on sexual violence, 20 on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and two on general RH topics. In comparison to the program evaluation papers identified, three times as many papers were found that reported RH descriptive or prevalence data in humanitarian settings. While data demonstrating the magnitude of the problem are crucial and were previously lacking, the need for RH services and for evaluations to measure their effectiveness is clear. Program evaluation and implementation science should be incorporated into more programs to determine the best ways to serve the RH needs of people affected by conflict or natural disaster. Standard program design should include rigorous program evaluation, and the results must be shared. The papers demonstrated both that RH programs can be implemented in these challenging settings, and that women and men will use RH services when they are of reasonable quality.

AB  - Unlike traditional marketing methods, neuromarketing has shown new insights and higher prediction accuracy. This research uses the bibliometric method to analyze the objectives like the analysis and integration of the green concept of neuromarketing, recognition of the useful authors, the years of publication of documents, authoritative journals that publish articles in this field and keywords around the concept of neuromarketing. The tools presented in neuromarketing expand and improve the perception of the enthusiasts and researchers in this field, and it compares the results obtained from different approaches. From the methodological point of view, this research is qualitative and based on Iden et al.'s (2017) model, consisting of four steps of planning, selecting, extracting and implementing and combining it with setting of Silva's (2015) articles in the form of a review. A bibliometric system is implemented, and VOS viewer software was used to analyze the results.The findings are presented in two phases. In the first phase, the performance analysis, the share of the annual production of neuromarketing documents, the percentage of the production of authoritative quarterly journals of this field, the share of the output of related subject areas, the share of the countries' published articles and the share of the documents by productive authors were identified and studied. Also, knowledge maps were drawn in the second phase, and 17 clusters are found, including 109 items and 131 keywords. The theoretical contribution of this article consists of the field of green neuromarketing, which is categorized into four clusters with themes of sustainability and green consumption. The results of this study were obtained based on the framework of theory, context, method, antecedents, decisions, and outcomes. All the keywords related to neuromarketing were categorized from the analysis of the previous articles and its features were studied in the proposed model.

AB  - While innovation should be about socioeconomic transformation of society, concerns have been raised about its negative externalities including growing disparities within and between regions. Arguably, Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) offers a potential solution to address these concerns. However, in theory, its conceptualization and operationalization remain ambiguous. Further, in practice, this makes its application to regional development difficult. Accordingly, this study first conducts a systematic literature review of conceptual papers on RRI. It identifies themes and categorizes them into four domains: drivers, tools, outcomes and barriers. Second, these domains are applied to regional innovation studies. The paper contributes to an increased understanding of RRI and its applications to sustainable regional development as well as how RRI and regional innovation studies can benefit from each other.

AB  - CO2 generated by the combustion of fossil fuels is the main source of global warming. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered to play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Calcium looping (CaL) process is a promising carbon capture technology to minimize efficiency penalty and related augment in electricity cost. This review first provides an overview of the available conventional bench-scale, pilot-scale and demonstrationscale testing facilities (1 kWth-20 WMth) worldwide, with a focus on summarizing the characteristics and operational status of the testing facilities, and extracting critical experimental results. There were two kinds of optimized systems that can alleviate the problems faced by conventional systems. To solve the problem of adverse effects of impurity elements from fuel combustions on CO2 capture, indirectly heated calciners had been constructed and tested. To solve the problem of the rapid decay of sorbents with increasing number of cycles, three methods had been used to optimize the systems, including introducing steam during the carbonation and/ or the calcination process, intermediate hydration after calcination and re-carbonation by partial CO2 from calciner.

AB  - In recent decades; the balance of power between institutional and economic actors has radically changed; with a significant impact on the modes and dynamics of governance. In the broad array of experimental practices of co-production; Living Labs (LLs) represent a promising mode of collaboration among public bodies; research centres; private companies and citizens. By means of LLs; public actors aim to co-produce experimental policies; breaking out of traditional policy schemes to find new solutions to collective problems. On an urban scale; such tools have come to be known as Urban Living Labs (ULLs), and they are increasingly used by local governments to tackle complex problems such us stimulating the circular economy to tackle climate change. This paper provides a systematic review of case studies to understand whether and how the ULLs can represent an effective policy tool to foster the circular economy on an urban scale.

AB  - Background: Care that is patient-centred is more likely to be sustainable and associated with improved health outcomes. This approach to care requires an understanding of patients' health service needs, yet few studies have directly investigated the perceived health service needs of people with inflammatory arthritis.
   Objectives: To systematically identify the existing literature relating to patient perceived health service needs for inflammatory arthritis.
   Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO was conducted (1990-2016). Studies examining patients' perceived needs relating to health services for inflammatory arthritis were identified. Descriptive data regarding study design and methodology were extracted and risk of bias assessed. Findings were collated and categorized thematically.
   Results: In total, 27 of 1405 (16 qualitative, 9 quantitative, and 2 mixed-methods) studies were relevant. The main areas of perceived need related to (1) Communication: consumers wanted clear, empathic communication, and to be involved with decision-making. (2) Characteristics of ongoing care: adequate consultation length with continuity and timely care were valued. (3) Factors influencing care-seeking included individual attitudes, disease severity, finances and family expectations. (4) Allied health and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) were perceived as useful by many. The reporting of CAM use to doctors was variable, with several factors contributing to under-reporting.
   Conclusions: This review identified patients' perceived needs for better communication with their health providers, the heterogeneity of influences determining when care is sought and preferences regarding non-pharmacologic therapies. Aligning patients' perceived needs with evidence-based therapy for people with inflammatory arthritis will be important in optimizing patient outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous studies have indicated that proximity to nature positively affects human well-being. Landscape planning and related techniques have been widely implemented to achieve balance between natural environments and human society, thereby contributing to human well-being. This study examines peer-reviewed empirical research using scientometric analysis and systematic review to clarify how landscape planning enhances human well-being. On analysing 439 documents, we found a significant increase in publications by multidisciplinary teams in this research area from 2016 to date. There was an uneven global distribution of publications, with most institutions cooperating within the same continent. These findings suggest the potential for greater international collaboration in the future. We identified three main research topics in this field, traced their dynamic development, and highlighted intangible values requiring attention. Moreover, we proposed a loop of 'naturalness-landscape structures-landscape services-human well-being' which includes four intermediary steps to illustrate how landscape planning can improve human well-being. This loop clarifies the pathway between landscape planning approaches and human well-being, thus providing a foundation for future research. Overall, this research highlights the conceptual pathways of landscape planning in promoting human well-being and calls for further investigation to fully understand this complex relationship.

AB  - Construction and demolition (C&D) waste consists of debris generated from construction, repair, renovation, and demolition of bridges, roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. It has certain adverse environmental impacts resulting in the consumption of valuable land space, landfill depletion, consumption of energy, and non-energy resources, resource depletion, pollution, etc. This paper presents a systematic review of literature on research pertaining to the usage of different types of C&D wastes as aggregate in the bound and unbound subbase or base layers of pavement. The literature search on two databases, namely: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, resulted in 7610 records. After adopting inclusion and exclusion criteria, the full text of 122 records is critically assessed. The efficacy of utilization of C&D waste in base or subbase layers in terms of mechanical and durability properties has been critically reviewed. California bearing ratio (CBR), and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) value of blended C&D waste materials are found to decrease with an increase in waste content in the mix. However, chemical stabilization could result in the enhancement of both properties. The resilient moduli for these waste materials are found to be enhanced with an increase in stabilizer dosage, curing duration, and confining pressure. Similarly, the permanent deformation of treated C&D waste materials has shown a decreasing trend with an increase in the stabilizer content. The addition of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) aggregates to the cement-treated base reduced the flexural strength but enhanced the ductile behaviour. Research gaps are identified critically and future prospectives are proposed. Evaluation of the suitability of unexplored wastes for subbase or base layers applications is suggested. The comprehensive information enlisted in this paper may serve as a guideline for adopting non-traditional aggregates in base or subbase layer construction. Further, the outcome of this investigation is expected to be beneficial to adjudge suitable construction practices to accelerate waste utilization for sustainable pavement construction.

AB  - Governments, businesses, and civil society organizations have diverse policy tools to incentivize adaptation. Policy tools can shape the type and extent of adaptation, and therefore, function either as barriers or enablers for reducing risk and vulnerability. Using data from a systematic review of academic literature on global adaptation responses to climate change (n = 1549 peer-reviewed articles), we categorize the types of policy tools used to shape climate adaptation. We apply qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess the contexts where particular tools are used, along with equity implications for groups targeted by the tools, and the tools' relationships with transformational adaptation indicators such as the depth, scope, and speed of adaptation. We find diverse types of tools documented across sectors and geographic regions. We also identify a mismatch between the tools that consider equity and those that yield more transformational adaptations. Direct regulations, plans, and capacity building are associated with higher depth and scope of adaptation (thus transformational adaptation), while economic instruments, information provisioning, and networks are not; the latter tools, however, are more likely to target marginalized groups in their design and implementation. We identify multiple research gaps, including a need to assess instrument mixes rather than single tools and to assess adaptations that result from policy implementation. Key policy insights Information-based approaches, networks, and economic instruments are the most frequently documented adaptation policy tools worldwide. Direct regulations, plans, and capacity building are associated with higher depth and scope of adaptation, and thus more transformational adaptation. Capacity building, economic instruments, networks, and information provisioning approaches are more likely to target specific marginalized groups and thus equity challenges. There are many regions and sectors where certain tools are not widely documented (e.g. regulations and plans in Africa and Asia), representing a key research gap.

AB  - We developed a conceptual framework that describes the key role of ecosystem services in urban ecological infrastructure. From this framework we analyze how research on ecosystem services has been addressed in cities of Latin America and the Caribbean, in order to discuss their incorporation into policies of urban planning, in the context of nature-based solutions and sustainable development goals. Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Argentina represent 90% of research in urban ecosystem services, all of them except Colombia had carried out studies considering green, blue and gray-hybrid infrastructures. However, green-hybrid infrastructure clustered most of the studies. Ecosystem service supply component and intermediate beneficiaries are the most studied. Our results show that most studies have not been developed from the perspective of the biophysical, sociocultural or economic assessment of ecosystem services, on the contrary we recognized or deduced them from proxy variables found within the studies. Our findings suggest that the study of urban ecosystem services in Latin America and the Caribbean is in development and has begun to increase in the last decade. However, we found that the incorporation of urban ecosystem services in urban planning is low, but at the same time, it is in a promising development related to the application of innovative actions such as nature-based solutions and in support of the new global urban agenda.

Global Health Capacity Building (GHCB) initiatives have the potential to improve health workforce performance and health outcomes, however little is known about the GHCB topics and approaches implemented in this region. This is the first systematic review of GHCB initiatives among LMICs in the MENA region. Methods An academic database search of Medline (OVID), PubMed, Scopus,, and Open Grey was conducted for articles published between January 2009 and September 2019 in English. Next, a grey literature search following a recommended search framework was conducted. Reviewed records addressed a global health topic, had a capacity building component, looked at specific learning outcomes, and reflected an LMIC in the MENA. Primary outcomes included country, topic, modality, pedagogy, and population. Results Reports of GHCB initiatives were retrieved from grey sources (73.2%) and academic sources (26.8%). Most GHCB initiatives were mainly conducted face-to-face (94.4%) to professional personnel (57.5%) through a theoretical pedagogical approach (44.3%). Dominant global health themes were non-communicable diseases (29.2%), sexual and reproductive health (18.4%), and mental health (14.5%). When matched against the Global Burden of Disease data, important gaps were found regarding the topics of GHCB initiatives in relation to the region's health needs. There were limited reports of GHCB initiatives addressing conflict and emergency topics, and those addressing non-communicable disease topics were primarily reported from Egypt and Iran. Conclusion Innovative and practicum-based approaches are needed for GHCB initiatives among LMICs in the MENA region, with a focus on training community workers. Regional and country-specific analyses of GHCB initiatives relative to their health needs are discussed in the manuscript based on the results of this review.

AB  - Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is one of the targets for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3. The impetus for UHC has led to an increased demand for time-sensitive tools to enhance our knowledge of how health systems function and to evaluate impact of system interventions. We define the field of "health system modeling" (HSM) as an area of research where dynamic mathematical models can be designed in order to describe, predict, and quantitatively capture the functioning of health systems. HSM can be used to explore the dynamic relationships among different system components, including organizational design, financing and other resources (such as investments in resources and supply chain management systems) what we call "inputs" on access, coverage, and quality of care what we call "outputs", toward improved health system "outcomes", namely increased levels and fairer distributions of population health and financial risk protection:
   We undertook a systematic review to identify the existing approaches used in HSM. We identified "systems thinking" a conceptual and qualitative description of the critical interactions within a health system as an important underlying precursor to HSM, and collated a critical collection of such articles. We then reviewed and categorized articles from two schools of thoughts: "system dynamics" (SD)" and "susceptible-infected-recovered-plus" (SIR+). SD emphasizes the notion of accumulations of stocks in the system, inflows and outflows, and causal feedback structure to predict intended and unintended consequences of policy interventions. The SIR + models link a typical disease transmission model with another that captures certain aspects of the system that impact the outcomes of the main model. These existing methods provide critical insights in informing the design of HSM, and provide a departure point to extend this research agenda. We highlight the opportunity to advance modeling methods to further understand the dynamics between health system inputs and outputs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimBiological invasions are among the main threats to biodiversity. To promote a mechanistic understanding of the ecological impacts of non-native seaweeds, we assessed how effects on resident organisms vary according to their trophic level.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe performed meta-analytical comparisons of the effects of non-native seaweeds on both individual species and communities. We compared the results of analyses performed on the whole dataset with those obtained from experimental data only and, when possible, between rocky and soft bottoms.
   ResultsMeta-analyses of data from 100 papers revealed consistent negative effects of non-native seaweeds across variables describing resident primary producer communities. In contrast, negative effects of seaweeds on consumers emerged only on their biomass and, limited to rocky bottoms, diversity. At the species level, negative effects were consistent across primary producers' response variables, while only the survival of consumers other than herbivores or predators (e.g. deposit/suspension feeders or detritivores) decreased due to invasion. Excluding mensurative data, negative effects of seaweeds persisted only on resident macroalgal communities and consumer species survival, while switched to positive on the diversity of rocky-bottom consumers. However, negative effects emerged for biomass and, in rocky habitats, density of consumers other than herbivores or predators.
   Main conclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that seaweeds' effects on resident biodiversity are generally more negative within the same trophic level than on higher trophic guilds. Finer trophic grouping of resident organisms revealed more complex impacts than previously detected. High heterogeneity in the responses of some consumer guilds suggests that impacts of non-native seaweeds at higher trophic levels may be more invader- and species-specific than competitive effects at the same trophic level. Features of invaded habitats may further increase variability in seaweeds' impacts. More experimental data on consumers' response to invasion are needed to disentangle the effects of non-native seaweeds from those of other environmental stressors.

AB  - Integration of sustainability elements into firms' innovation activities, known as sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI), has received widespread attention both academically and practically, especially over the last decade [1]-[3]. Yet the results of recent systematic reviews suggest that the study of SOI centres on developed economies, with emerging economies lagging far behind, and Indonesia which is included in major emerging economies within the BRIICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, South Africa) -has not been discussed at all. We need, therefore, to examine this research area in this specific setting. Reflecting on nine semi-structured qualitative interviews with business owners and senior managers in Indonesia, this paper reveals how participants consider this research area, identifies themes emerging related to innovation and sustainability, and provides a preliminary analysis of how firms in Indonesia are approaching SOI.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is a known source of disturbance to many wildlife populations. We systematically reviewed 126 relevant papers that study the impact of outdoor recreation on wildlife, focusing on terrestrial wildlife (birds excluded) to assess the different methodological approaches adopted by researchers. We characterised the research methods into seven categories (direct observation, indirect observation (field-based), telemetry, camera traps, physiological measurement, trapping, and simulation). We find that direct observation is the most commonly used method to capture human-wildlife interactions, followed by the use of telemetry, and camera traps. The animals most commonly studied were ungulates, and the orders Carnivora and Rodentia. Studies typically captured data over longer periods (median 54 months) when using trapping methods; other methods exhibited shorter study durations (median 22 months). The size of the animal under study appears to influence how methods are chosen, with larger species often being studied using telemetry methods. We highlight advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on the aims of the study, the focal species, and the type of outdoor recreation. Our review highlights the need for simultaneous measurements of both human activity and wildlife response. We also recommend that researchers consider how to capture both short- and long-term impacts on animal welfare. Our findings should guide applied wildlife conservation and management research in scenarios where human-wildlife interactions lead to conservation issues.

AB  - Agriculture in West Africa faces the challenge of meeting the rising demand for food as national incomes and populations increase while production becomes more uncertain due to climate change. Crop production models can provide helpful information on agricultural yields under a range of climate change scenarios and on the impact of adaptation strategies. Here, we report a systematic review of the impact of climate change on the yield of major staple crops in West Africa. Unlike earlier reviews we pay particular attention to the potential of common agricultural adaptation strategies (such as optimised planting dates, use of fertilisers and climate-resilient crop varieties) to mitigate the effects of climate change on crop yields. We systematically searched two databases for literature published between 2005 and 2020 and identified 35 relevant studies. We analysed yield changes of major staple crops (maize, sorghum, rice, millet, yam, cassava and groundnuts) caused by different climate change and field management scenarios. Yields declined by a median of 6% (-8% to +2% depending on the crop) due to climate change in all scenarios analysed. We show that the common adaptation strategies could increase crop yields affected by climate change by 13% (-4% to +19% depending on the strategy) as compared to business-as-usual field management practices, and that optimised planting dates and cultivars with longer crop cycle duration could in fact offset the negative effects of climate change on crop yields. Increased fertiliser use has not mitigated the impact of climate change on crops but could substantially increase yields now and in the future. Our results suggest that a combination of increased fertiliser use and adopting cropping practices that take advantage of favourable climate conditions have great potential to protect and enhance future crop production in West Africa.

AB  - Vegetation trampling resulting from recreation can adversely impact natural habitats, leading to the loss of vegetation and the degradation of plant communities. A considerable primary literature exists on this topic, therefore it is important to assess whether this accumulated evidence can be used to reach general conclusions concerning vegetation vulnerability to inform conservation management decisions. Experimental trampling studies on a global scale were retrieved using a systematic review methodology and synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. The relationships between vegetation recovery and each of initial vegetation resistance, trampling intensity, time for recovery, Raunkiaer life-form (perennating bud position), and habitat were tested using random effects multiple meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. The systematic search yielded 304 studies; of these, nine reported relevant randomized controlled experiments, providing 188 vegetation recovery effect sizes for analysis. The synthesis indicated there was significant heterogeneity in the impact of trampling on vegetation recovery. This was related to resistance and recovery time, and the interactions of these variables with Raunkiaer life-form, but was not strongly dependent on the intensity of the trampling experienced. The available evidence suggests that vegetation dominated by hemicryptophytes and geophytes recovers from trampling to a greater extent than vegetation dominated by other life-forms. Variation in effect within the chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte and geophyte life-form sub-groups was also explained by the initial resistance of vegetation to trampling, but not by trampling intensity. Intrinsic properties of plant communities appear to be the most important factors determining the response of vegetation to trampling disturbance. Specifically, the dominant Raunkiaer life-form of a plant community accounts for more variation in the resilience of communities to trampling than the intensity of the trampling experienced, suggesting that simple assessments based on this trait could guide decisions concerning sustainable access to natural areas. Methodological and reporting limitationsmust be overcome before more disparate types of evidence can be synthesised; this would enable more reliable extrapolation to non-study situations, and a more comprehensive understanding of how assessments of intrinsic plant traits can be used to underpin conservation management decisions concerning access.

AB  - Background With rapid urbanization, the urban environment, especially the neighborhood environment, has received increasing global attention. However, a comprehensive overview of the association between neighborhood risk factors and human health remains unclear due to the large number of neighborhood risk factor-human health outcome pairs.Method On the basis of a whole year of panel discussions, we first obtained a list of 5 neighborhood domains, containing 33 uniformly defined neighborhood risk factors. We only focused on neighborhood infrastructure-related risk factors with the potential for spatial interventions through urban design tools. Subsequently, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic meta-review of 17 infrastructure-related risk factors of the 33 neighborhood risk factors (e.g., green and blue spaces, proximity to major roads, and proximity to landfills) was conducted using four databases, Web of Science, PubMed, OVID, and Cochrane Library, from January 2000 to May 2021, and corresponding evidence for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) was synthesized. The review quality was assessed according to the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) standard.Results Thirty-three moderate-and high-quality reviews were included in the analysis. Thirteen major NCD outcomes were found to be associated with neighborhood infrastructure-related risk factors. Green and blue spaces or walkability had protective effects on human health. In contrast, proximity to major roads, industry, and landfills posed serious threats to human health. Inconsistent results were obtained for four neighborhood risk factors: facilities for physical and leisure activities, accessibility to infrastructure providing unhealthy food, proximity to industry, and proximity to major roads.Conclusions This meta-review presents a comprehensive overview of the effects of neighborhood infrastructure-related risk factors on NCDs. Findings on the risk factors with strong evidence can help improve healthy city guidelines and promote urban sustainability. In addition, the unknown or uncertain association between many neighborhood risk factors and certain types of NCDs requires further research.

AB  - In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, considerable dietary shifts, including an increase in the consumption of fruit and vegetables (FV) will be required. However, worldwide consumption of FV is far below international recommendations, including in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Africa. Understanding what, where, when, and how people choose to eat requires an understanding of how individuals are influenced by factors in their social, physical, and macro-level environments. In order to develop effective interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, the factors influencing consumer behavior need to be better understood. We conducted a rapid review to assess and synthesize data on individual, social, physical, and macro-level factors that enable or constrain fruit and vegetable consumption and purchase among adults living in sub-Saharan Africa. Our conceptual framework is based on a socio-ecological model which has been adapted to settings in LMICs and Africa. We systematically searched four electronic databases including Scopus, Medline (PubMed), PsycInfo, and African Index Medicus, and screened Google Scholar for gray literature. We included a total of 52 studies and narratively summarized the existing evidence for each identified factor across the different levels. We found that most studies assessed demographic factors at the individual level including household or family income, socio-economic status and education. Furthermore we identified a variety of important factors that influence FV consumption, in the social, physical, and macro environment. These include women's empowerment and gender inequalities, the influence of neighborhood and retail food environment such as distance to market and price of FV as well as the importance of natural landscapes including forest areas for FV consumption. This review identified the need to develop and improve indicators both for exposure and outcome variables but also to diversify research approaches.

AB  - 3 Meaningful collaboration among heterogeneous stakeholders is essential for achieving sustainability in agri-food supply chains. A substantial amount of research has been focused on examining factors that are critical in shaping characteristics and effectiveness of collaboration in sustainable supply chains from various perspectives. The divergence of such studies and their findings, however, has led to a great proliferation of collaboration behavioural factors proposed. As much as contributing to understanding, different terms and definitions of similar concepts or nature introduced in the literature often also add too much confusion of agri-food supply chain stakeholders in interpreting, evaluating and improving collaboration behaviour. So far, there is lack of a structured analysis on commonalities among those behavioural factors to cluster or consolidate for enhanced clarity and efficiency in assessing and managing collaboration performance toward sustainable agri-food supply chains. Aimed to address such a limitation, this paper applies a systematic review to investigate the landscape of extant literature via the lenses of Resource Dependency Theory and Content Analysis. As a result, 10 key behavioural factors to enable an effective collaboration system for sustainable agri-food supply chain management are identified, which are Joint Efforts, Sharing Activities, Collaboration Value, Adaptation, Trust, Commitment, Power, Continuous Improvement, Coordination and Stability. The findings from this study can be used as a guideline for future research in agri-food supply chain collaboration and help to model and measure collaboration performance more effectively and efficiently.

AB  - Green building incentives are important to promoting green building. However, it lacks a systematic review of existing knowledge. This paper aims to elicit the common themes in studies of green building incentives through a systematic review. It is found that the common research areas into green building incentives are incentive categorisation, its effectiveness on promoting green building development, criticism of current green incentive implementation and strategies for improving green building incentives. Green building incentives are categorised into external and internal incentives. The external incentive is a forced choice whereby beneficiaries are required to fulfil specified conditions or requirements before benefitting, while the internal incentive allows beneficiaries to be incentivised out of volition because of the appeal of the benefits of green buildings. The external incentives, which are largely provided by the government, are divided into financial and non-financial incentives. It is found that owners are more incentivised by non-financial incentives. In terms of effectiveness, both external and internal incentives are important instruments for promoting green building, although it is not clear which are the more effective. Furthermore, the review uncovered criticisms of external green building incentives, which mainly focus on shortcomings in administering the incentives by the government. The strategies for improving green building incentives were also found, the most important of these being the need for the government to redirect its approach of providing incentives so that owners can be encouraged to pursue green building. The review findings signify the importance of the government in relation to green building incentives. Further research areas that could expand the knowledge of green building incentives are also recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cotton productivity continues to be disputed, despite rapid advancements and widespread technologies. These uncertainties remain to be critically addressed in a broad spectrum focusing on domains at the global level. Therefore, this systematic review provides an overview of the existing advancements in knowledge, skills, and technologies for sustainable cotton production on small landholdings. Specifically, the areas of the cotton chain examined are threefold: - (1) Explore disguised agronomic practices to be endowed for sustainable cotton production on small landholdings; (2) Explore socioeconomic settings based on their disparities in contributing to sustainable cotton production on small landholdings; and (3) Explore existing and feasible institutional policies to be enforced for sustainable cotton production on small landholdings. This review shows that worldwide cotton production involves conventional and organic systems, at the expense of the traditional system. Heavy uses of nitrogenous fertilizers and pesticides are the common practices in conventional systems, with some adoptions of precision agriculture practices, and genetically modified varieties. Rotation and intercropping with early-maturing food crops are also identified viable options to improve farmers' attitudes toward adopting cotton-producing technologies. In socioeconomics, farmers' livelihoods are improved by income generation from sales of cotton and labour in the cotton industry. Gender equity in the cotton industry prioritizes females over males, as females display a group with a higher level of technology adoption. Generally, clear institutional policies governing the cotton industry are globally paucity. Furthermore, efforts to sensitize sustainable cotton production are still highly questionable and challenged by the superseding climate changes.

AB  - Our biosphere has been adversely affected by plastic waste pollution, especially non-biodegradables in landfills, which induces hazardous chemical leaching and toxic gas emissions on burning into the atmosphere. Conventional methods for recycling plastic waste typically result in products with a lower significance than that of the original plastic or ineffective thermal energy recovery. Upcycling methods have recently been identified as a viable way to turn plastic waste into goods with added benefits. In this article, we provide a minireview on plastic waste generation, recent developments in the upcycling of plastic waste, technical difficulties, potential future advancements, and new opportunities for a sustainable society.

AB  - Background Early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings offer a potentially cost-effective and sustainable solution for ensuring children have opportunities to meet physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) guidelines. This paper systematically reviewed the association between childcare environment and practice and children's PA and ST. Methods Three electronic databases were searched, and citation tracking of eligible studies performed between June-July 2020 (updated March 2022). Studies were eligible when (i) participants attended ECEC settings, (ii) they reported the association between use of outdoor space, including factors of time, availability, play, size and equipment, and children's device-measured PA and ST, and (iii) where applicable, they compared the exposure to use of indoor space. Risk of bias was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tools. A synthesis was performed using effect direct plots and charts to visualise effect sizes. Results Of 1617 reports screened, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies provided data on outdoor versus indoor time (n = 9; 960 children), outdoor versus indoor play (n = 3; 1104 children), outdoor play space (n = 19; 9596 children), outdoor space use external to ECEC (n = 2; 1148 children), and portable (n = 7; 2408 children) and fixed (n = 7; 2451 children) outdoor equipment. Time spent outdoors versus indoors was associated with increased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA) and total PA, while the association with ST was inconclusive. The mean (standard deviation) levels of outdoor MVPA (4.0 +/- 3.2 to 18.6 +/- 5.6 min/h) and LPA (9.9 +/- 2.6 to 30.8 +/- 11.8 min/h) were low, and ST high (30.0 +/- 6.5 to 46.1 +/- 4.3 min/h). MVPA levels doubled when children played outdoors versus indoors. Outdoor play space, and outdoor portable equipment, were associated with increased MVPA. A dose-response relationship for outdoor play area size was observed, demonstrating increased MVPA with areas >= 505m(2) (5436 ft(2)), but no further increases when areas were > 900m(2) (9688 ft(2)). No studies reported on injuries in outdoor settings. Conclusions ECEC policies and practices should promote not only outdoor time but also the availability of resources such as portable play equipment and sufficient size of outdoor play areas that enable children to be physically active for sustained periods while outdoors.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the scientific production on Rural Entrepreneurship and its connection to the Tourism sector. For that, the text mining method with articles and reviews was used. Through a specific analysis structure, dimensional words were extracted that characterize the themes: Social Entrepreneurship, Business Strategies, Gender, Local Socioeconomic Impact, Innovation and Competitiveness, Migration, and Technologies. These themes were previously selected from a systematic review. The results indicate India as the country that most studies on Rural Entrepreneurship, and where the theme of Gender has greater relevance. However, it was noted that the tourism sector is not significant in this region. It is in Spain that tourism activity shows a stronger link with entrepreneurship in rural areas. The areas of knowledge show that the studies are concentrated in Social Sciences and Business, Management, and Accounting. In short, this work presented a study to assist in a better understanding of the evolution of research on tourism as a way of undertaking in rural areas.

AB  - This article explores new relationships between two sets of theories-the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and social practice theories (SPT)-that are applicable in planning and evaluating sustainable transition interventions. The authors propose a practical analytical framework to inform the choice of actual policy mixes and help to design and evaluate the results of sustainable energy transition interventions. For this purpose, six policy intervention points are connected across niches, regimes and landscapes stemming from the MLP with six strategies of practice change deriving from SPT. This article presents the results of a systematic review of 34 papers on sustainable energy transitions covering intervention points and practice change strategies. Informed by the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the review, the authors suggest that certain policy intervention points require consideration of specific social practice change strategies to make progress. Bridging the systemic view of the MLP with a zoom-in to ways of changing social practices provides a comprehensive framework both for analysts and change-makers within the field of sustainability transitions.

AB  - This study aims to identify how the paradigm of outbound tourism expenditure (OTE) research transforms from economic to social concern. It also explicates the evolution of OTE from an advocacy platform to a sustainability platform. This study adopts a hybrid of narrative and systematic reviews to study OTE as a complex social phenomenon. This hybrid review is complemented by a thematic review and semantic network analysis on gaps and future directions of relevant studies. The results reveal that the paradigm of OTE research is directed from economic toward social thinking. This study proposes an application of socially related antecedent configurations, social theories, pragmatic methods, and various scales of study contexts as promising solutions to address the complexity and heterogeneity of OTE. The study concludes that the conceptual structure of OTE is premised on a sustainability platform, which is influenced by socio-cultural, environmental, economic, and political issues. This study provides a road map that enlightens the current state of OTE, prevailing topics, and pathways for further research.

AB  - Background Voluntary Sustainability Standards and ecolabels are market-based mechanisms used to encourage producers and consumers toward environmental sustainability. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) aims to improve ocean health and promote a sustainable seafood market. There is growing interest in the program's impacts (direct and indirect) from changes to fisheries management and consumer awareness to market access and the reputation of fisheries. To better understand what is known about the program's impacts and the quality of evidence available, this map collates and describes articles on the environmental, social, institutional and economic effects of the MSC, identifying the methods used to determine impacts, and highlighting knowledge gaps and clusters. Methods Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches of peer-reviewed literature were conducted in Web of Science, SCOPUS and AGRIS. Grey literature was gathered from Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and three subject-specific websites. A total of 771 articles were retrieved, 271 of which were screened at full-text. 28 articles met all inclusion criteria and a further 37 met all the criteria but did not have a comparator. Additionally, 108 articles that describe the MSC but do not investigate its impacts (thus failing on 'comparator' and 'outcome' inclusion criteria) were included in the narrative report. This provides an overview of MSC topics that are of general interest to researchers in comparison to articles that investigate MSC's impact. Results Evidence of the impact of MSC certification fall in the following topic categories: economic (38%), environmental (25%), governance (29%) and social (8%). These articles documented diverse outcomes related to MSC certification. The most common are price premiums, market access, changes in stock health, ecosystem impacts and fisheries management changes. A key knowledge gap are articles on the effects of the MSC's Chain of Custody Standard and its effects on the supply chain. Generally, literature focused on European and North American fisheries with little focus on fisheries situated in lower-income countries. Conclusions Research interest in the MSC has grown over the last two decades, however, little research uses study designs and evidence that can robustly detect or attribute change to the MSC. Greater focus on conducting robust quasi-experimental designs would help to better understand the program effects. Comparing areas of interest in the general literature (which, for example, shows greater focus on the governance aspects of the programme than found in literature using comparators) suggests that this is partly due to lack of resources, data access and the challenge of obtaining counterfactuals. Nevertheless, some topics were absent in all areas, such as the social and economic dynamics that link harvesters and supply chain actors. It is important to fill the identified knowledge gaps as the behaviours of certified harvesters, supply chain actors and other stakeholders are the key through which the public influence sustainability, market inclusion/exclusion operates, and inequality is generated. Understanding these processes can have wider relevance in the field, informing the design of other sustainability interventions.

AB  - Cities worldwide are facing a significant threat of stormwater hazards caused by the increase in extreme downpours and urbanization. Meso-level urban stormwater management focuses on alleviating the detrimental impacts of urban flooding and enhancing water resource utilization at the block or community scale, typically through 1) specific policies and management rules; 2) catchment-scale scenario simulation, optimization and evaluation; 3) the group of stormwater control measures implementation. It may effectively coordinate macro-level urban stormwater management planning and micro-level distributed stormwater control facilities. This study conducts a review of Urban Stormwater Management at Meso-level (USM-M) with a view to research publication trends, citation analysis, geographic spread and subject category, as well as content analysis, including temporal progression and research gaps. The Web of Science database and CiteSpace are used for the bibliometric analysis of 66 articles from 2006 to 2021. The results show that the number of USM-M topic articles generally has an upward trend over the years. Whilst the United States and China are leading research on this topic, the European countries have diverse local research and dense cooperation. Research foci have generally shifted from theoretical frameworks to multi-element subdivided topics and specific technical roadmaps. Moreover, the spatial layout optimization and multi-functional integration are, or will be, potential research directions in terms of enhancing stormwater utilization and co-benefits of USM-M. This systematic review concludes trends, challenges and potential approaches of USM-M, and aims to provide recommendations for researchers and policymakers on the development of a more advanced and comprehensive USM-M.

AB  - Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a "natural " forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.

AB  - Agriculture is essential to a flourishing economy. Although soil is essential for sustainable food production, its quality can decline as cultivation becomes more intensive and demand increases. The importance of healthy soil cannot be overstated, as a lack of nutrients can significantly lower crop yield. Smart soil prediction and digital soil mapping offer accurate data on soil nutrient distribution needed for precision agriculture. Machine learning techniques are now driving intelligent soil prediction systems. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of machine learning in predicting soil qualities. The components and qualities of soil, the prediction of soil parameters, the existing soil dataset, the soil map, the effect of soil nutrients on crop growth, as well as the soil information system, are the key subjects under inquiry. Smart agriculture, as exemplified by this study, can improve food quality and productivity.

AB  - While the concept of green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly popular, definitions, terminology, and goals differ based on geographic and disciplinary context. This paper examines these differences through a three-part systematic review: 1) content analysis of academic GI review publications, 2) bibliometric review of academic publications focusing on GI and GI-associated terms, and 3) an online search for grey GI literature. Parsing out conceptualizations of GI, and the agendas they support, helps us better understand its probable outcomes in different contexts. We find that urban planning, urban forestry, ecology, engineering, landscape architecture, and law have epistemic claims to GI, and use divergent conceptualizations to implement the concept. Moreover, there are a number of related concepts, each of which is associated with a distinct scholarly community. These different conceptualizations and terms can be grouped into three primary categories: GI as 1) a greenspace planning concept, 2) an urban ecology concept, and 3) a water/stormwater management concept. Cutting across these categories we find the ecosystem services concept, a focus on specific engineered facility types, and a gradient of implicit GI definitions. A surprising number of publications (41% of those reviewed here) do not define GI, which can cause confusion or lead to implementation of GI projects that fail to meet expectations. We therefore argue that scholars and practitioners need to be explicit and specific about how they are defining GI and its purpose to avoid the siloing of research and practice and to take advantage of opportunities to address multiple agendas simultaneously.

AB  - Rail trail developments involve converting disused railway corridors into multi-use spaces for leisure, tourism, and sustainable mobility. The transformation of disused railway corridors into successful rail trail developments in the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom has contributed to a resurgence in community, government and business interest in developing rail trails in other countries. As evident from several jurisdictions, rail trail development has the potential to spark debates around fundamental issues related to prudent use of dormant public assets, namely railway corridors. This exploratory systematic review examined peer-reviewed studies of rail trails published in English language academic journals to examine the substance, extent and research gaps of this distinct subset of the broader literature on trails. A fledgling, fragmented body of knowledge was identified, spanning themes from planning, management and user experience to social, economic and environmental impacts of rail trails. Directions for future research are provided.

AB  - The effects and consequences of climate change have been extensively considered in the urban design qualities. The climatic factors directly affect human activities in urban spaces, particularly in the pedestrian environment. The global issues on climate change could be well understood by understanding the contributions of climatic conditions towards thermal environmental discomforts. So, the roles and processes in urban design can be enhanced to reduce the impacts of extreme urban climate on pedestrian experiences. This current article focused on the systematic review of thermal comfort through urban designing, detailing the objectives, methods used, and the body of knowledge to deal with this issue. This paper also summarizes the current understanding and challenges in addressing the microclimatic analysis roles in human life by discussing the thermal comfort studies and literature regarding human, building, and city levels. Finally, this systemic study demonstrated the needs and potential assessments based on the quality and standardization of human-centric data collection and interpretation. It specifically addressed an urban planner's structure that could be used as an empirical method during the urban planning processes. In conclusion, the applications of the recommended methods identified in this study aid in the design decisions to shift towards climate comfort in urban spaces.

AB  - The Arctic climate is rapidly changing, with wide ranging impacts on natural and social systems. A variety of adaptation policies, programs and practices have been adopted to this end, yet our understanding of if, how, and where adaptation is occurring is limited. In response, this paper develops a systematic approach to characterize the current state of adaptation in the Arctic. Using reported adaptations in the English language peer reviewed literature as our data source, we document 157 discrete adaptation initiatives between 2003 and 2013. Results indicate large variations in adaptation by region and sector, dominated by reporting from North America, particularly with regards to subsistence harvesting by Inuit communities. Few adaptations were documented in the European and Russian Arctic, or have a focus on the business and economy, or infrastructure sectors. Adaptations are being motivated primarily by the combination of climatic and non-climatic factors, have a strong emphasis on reducing current vulnerability involving incremental changes to existing risk management processes, and are primarily initiated and led at the individual/community level. There is limited evidence of trans-boundary adaptations or initiatives considering potential cross-scale/sector impacts.

AB  - This paper performs a systematic review of the research literature in the field of agritourism. In the study, using a structured literature review methodology, established as well as emerging research clusters have been identified for epistemological analysis. Such analysis helps in the identification of key research topics, interrelations, and collaboration patterns in the field of agritourism and other research areas involving similar concepts. Graphical mapping of the agritourism research field is done using visualization of similarities (VOS). VOS software analyzed bibliographic data of 459 research publications obtained from Web of Science and Scopus databases from a period of 1980-2019.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of the literature on quality of service and sustainable practices in the hospitality sector with the objective of analyzing the state of the art, identifying gaps for future lines of research, and defining a future research agenda. The number of articles on these topics, although not particularly high, does demonstrate a growing trend. Despite this growth, however, several untreated lines of research were detected in three specific areas. In the first area, emphasis is placed on the critical factors that affect the quality of service. In the second area are the specific practices and tools of sustainability and quality of service that affect development and business success. Finally, the third section analyses the impact of strategies and the management of sustainable practices and quality of service with respect to business development. Research questions have been defined for each area.

AB  - African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) are a keystone species in African ecosystems. As a result of increasing anthropogenic pressure, elephant populations have declined significantly in the last two centuries. Research on a broad sample of these populations is necessary to inform management strategies over a range of environmental and socio-political conditions. In order to evaluate the current state of literature that is informing evidence-based management and conservation of elephants, we systematically reviewed all research published on the ecology of African elephants from the last 20 years (492 publications). We contrasted the geographic distribution of published research against the 2016 IUCN elephant census. We found several statistically significant biases in the geographic distribution of elephant research. South Africa has 4.54% of the total elephant population and accounted for 28.28% of all research publications. Kenya has 5.49% the total elephant population but accounts for 20.6% of the research. Conversely, Botswana has 31.68% of the total elephant population but accounts for only 9.29% of the research and Zimbabwe has 19.89% of the total elephant population with only 10.50% of research. We also found that 41.85% of areas with similar to 60,100 elephants have not had any research published on their populations in the last 20 years. This publication imbalance may encourage management strategies that are overly dependent on misrepresentative information from a small subset of the elephant population. We recommend that (1) marginalised areas with large elephant populations (e.g., Botswana and Zimbabwe) should receive higher priority for future research, (2) new research and proposals should design theoretical frameworks to account for and overcome the present biases, and (3) local community-based management approaches should be prioritised and amplified in order to overcome the barriers to conducting research in priority areas.

AB  - Climate change affects, directly and indirectly, the tangible and intangible features of heritage sites. Conservation studies often examine the impacts of climate change on heritage sites by assuming it as an isolated and static concept. This study aims to debate cultural heritage concept as the primary and neglected factor for wise development of climate-resilience policies. We first adopt the qualitative Meta-synthesis method to analyze the impacts of climate change on world heritage sites, through a systematic review of reports published by the UNESCO and its advisory bodies. Then, it is explained why the sustainability of cultural heritage requires a fundamental reconsideration of the concept and promotion of its evaluation framework. The findings suggest that protection of cultural heritage and developing the climate-resilience policies for the sustainability of landscape requires at the early stages a reflection on how heritage is defined as a useful resource and acceptable characteristic of territory.

AB  - Despite the increasing importance of studies dealing with acceptance in the field of land use, few theoretical conceptual reflections and reviews have been published. To address this gap, this paper offers a critical and systematic review of recent literature regarding acceptance and land use. Our aim is to synthesise the contributions of these publications in order to advance scientific debate on this topic. The data set consists of 132 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and is dominated by empirical papers (mostly quantitative studies) and European case studies. Renewable energy appears as the most important thematic issue, followed by sustainable land use. In these studies, many researchers did not define acceptance or apply a theory. It seems to be perceived as an everyday term with a clear meaning. However, this review reveals that there is no common understanding of acceptance; instead, the given definitions and characteristics are sometimes even contradictory. Acceptance is often considered a positive and desirable outcome of planning projects. Only a few authors understand acceptance as a complex phenomenon. As a cross-sectoral research topic, it applies theories from different disciplines and research fields (psychology, sociology, and innovation research), even though the use of these theories within disciplines is not consistent. Most empirical studies address influencing factors with the aim of explaining decisions about acceptance. However, the theoretical foundation underlying the selection of factors is often weak. Therefore, we recommend that researchers engage in a thorough reflection of notions and concepts, suitable and sound identification of influencing factors. In concluding with our own theoretical-conceptual reflections, we support the idea that acceptance and acceptability should be distinguished to gain more clarity in the use of terms. Thus, acceptability encompasses actor-based and dynamic decision processes. The decisions are products of interactions among the actors, the object, and the context. They can be assigned to a particular degree (from rejection to acceptance or engagement) and made at the attitude, action, or utilization level. Finally, we believe that further research can benefit from this advanced concept of acceptability.

AB  - Oxygen (O-2) is the ultimate oxidant on Earth and its respiration confers such an energetic advantage that microorganisms have evolved the capacity to scavenge O-2 down to nanomolar concentrations. The respiration of O-2 at extremely low levels is proving to be common to diverse microbial taxa, including organisms formerly considered strict anaerobes. Motivated by recent advances in O-2 sensing and DNA/RNA sequencing technologies, we performed a systematic review of environmental metatranscriptomes revealing that microbial respiration of O-2 at nanomolar concentrations is ubiquitous and drives microbial activity in seemingly anoxic aquatic habitats. These habitats were key to the early evolution of life and are projected to become more prevalent in the near future due to anthropogenic-driven environmental change. Here, we summarize our current understanding of aerobic microbial respiration under apparent anoxia, including novel processes, their underlying biochemical pathways, the involved microorganisms, and their environmental importance and evolutionary origin.
   The discovery of microbial oxygen respiration at and below the oxygen detection limit is changing our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in oxygen-limited environments, from the early Earth to present-day expanding hypoxic zones.

AB  - The concepts of sustainability and circular economy (CE) have attracted enormous attention in the academic, business and political spheres. However, a systematic review of case studies concerning CE in the tourism industry remains lacking. The present study collected good environmental management practices and circular solutions related to energy, water and waste from tourist accommodations in Italy/Europe and China. Moreover, sustainable procedures were critically discussed within the strategic water-energy-waste-food-transport (WEWFT) nexus. When comprehensive data were available, good practices were also measured by Circular Indicators (CIs) and compared to benchmark values set by existing certification or labelling. CIs support the innovative, resilient and sustainable development and assessment of the tourism industry. Most of the strategies were focused on energy optimization and a lack of tangible data was depicted for food and waste management.

AB  - Culture is an essential component of Indigenous public spaces. However, a gap in knowledge exists regarding cultural influences on Indigenous public spaces in Africa. This paper, therefore, explores the impact of cultural worldviews on the landscape and functionality of Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo squares in Nigeria. It also assesses the contemporary state of the Nigerian squares. The paper employs mixed methods, including a systematic review of literature, observations, interviews, and photographic recordings, to shed light on the strengths and deficiencies of the Indigenous squares. Findings revealed that while Indigenous public spaces cater to the socio-cultural needs of different ethnic groups, they do not fully meet modern needs and expectations, especially concerning safety and comfort. This paper advocates for the fusion of Indigenous landscape practices with contemporary approaches to foster harmonious synergy between tradition and modernity and enhance public space utilisation.

AB  - As globalization has become a defining issue for business and society, an increasing amount of research has examined how multicultural experiences affect a variety of psychological and organizational outcomes. We define "multicultural experiences" as exposure to or interactions with elements or members of a different culture(s). We then provide a comprehensive review of the literature and detail how multicultural experiences impact intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational outcomes, including creativity, psychological adjustment, intergroup bias, trust, morality, leadership effectiveness, and individual or firm performance, exploring key mechanisms and boundary conditions that have also emerged. We then present a new theoretical framework-the "Structure-Appraisal Model of Multicultural Experiences"-that organizes the overall pattern of findings and provides a roadmap for future research. The structure part of our model proposes that deeper multicultural experiences produce integrative processes that transform intrapersonal cognition, whereas broader multicultural experiences activate comparative processes that influence interpersonal attitudes and behaviors. The appraisal part of our model suggests that these intrapersonal and interpersonal effects are only likely to occur when appraisals of one's multicultural experiences are positive rather than negative. We conclude by discussing practical implications for individuals and organizations, as well as future directions for researchers to consider exploring.

AB  - Neural network applications, as an emerging machine learning technology, are increasingly being integrated into pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies, offering significant improvement opportunities for performance, efficiency and sustainability. This review paper utilizes a systematic methodology to establish key literature trends and themes. The state-of-the-art body of knowledge in this hot research area is analyzed in descriptive (e.g. neural network technologies studied, sustainability indicators considered, manufacturing process addressed) and thematic synthesis components. Process analysis and improvement, quality control and additive manufacturing were identified as the three focal research themes, and research lines within these themes were further studied and discussed. To guide future research, potential paths and research questions are proposed against the gaps identified. The originality of this work lies in its methodology (adoption of a systematic review approach, highly limited in the current literature), its inclusion of sustainability (as an imperative concept for manufacturing technology research) and its specific focus on neural network applications in the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies (a perspective, either has been missing or addressed too widely by extant contributions).

AB  - There is evidence that Nigeria is already experiencing environmental challenges attributed to climate change (CC) and its impacts. This has clearly highlighted the need for knowledge-based strategies to help plan adequate mitigation and adaptation measures for the country. One of the basic requirements to ensure such strategies is the development of a database of national CC research. This will aid in the assessment of past and present scientific publications from which directions for future study can be mapped. The present study used standard, systematic, and bibliographic literature reviews to analyse the trend, focus, spatial variability, and effectiveness of published research on CC impacts in Nigeria. Four thematic areas of CC impact research were defined: Agriculture, Environment, Human and Multi-disciplinary study. A total of 701 articles were found to be relevant and the review shows that CC impacts and adaptations in the literature vary across research categories and locations. The period between 2011 (68 studies) and 2015 (80 studies) showed a tremendous rise in CC impact research with a peak in 2014 (84 studies). Studies in the agriculture category had the highest publications in 23 States of Nigeria. The review revealed three research gaps: (1) lack of research that investigated the magnitude of present and potential future impacts in the aquatic environment (2) little attention on CC impacts and adaptation in the Northern regions of Nigeria (3) absence of study investigating the effects of multiple variables of CC at the same time. The findings suggest that it would be useful to advance CC research in Nigeria beyond perceptive approaches to more quantitative ones. This is particularly important for highly vulnerable animals, crops, locations, and for better planning of adaptation strategies.

AB  - Aim: The introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) via man-made corridors connecting previously disparate oceanic regions is increasing globally. However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors facilitating invasion dynamics and their interactions are still largely unknown. This study compiles and inputs available data for the NIS bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis across the invaded biogeographic range in the Mediterranean basin into a species distribution model to predict future spread under a range of marine scenarios.
   Location: Mediterranean Sea.
   Methods: A systematic review produced the largest presence database ever assembled to inform the selection of biological, chemical and physical factors linked to the spread of B. pharaonis through the Suez Canal. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to simulate current and future trophic and salinity scenarios. A species distribution model was run to determine key drivers of invasion, quantify interactive impacts arising from a range of trophic states, salinity conditions and climatic scenarios and forecast future trajectories for the spread of NIS into new regions under multiple-parameter scenarios (based on the main factors identified from the systematic review).
   Results: Impacts on invasion trajectory arising from climate change and interactions with increasing salinity from the new opening of the canal were the primary drivers of expansion across the basin, the effects of which were further enhanced by eutrophication. Predictions of the current distribution were most accurate when multiple stressors were used to drive the model. A habitat suitability index developed at a subcontinental scale from model outputs identified novel favourable conditions for future colonization at specific locations under 2030 and 2050 climatic scenarios.
   Main conclusions: Future expansion of B. pharaonis will be enhanced by climate-facilitated increased sea temperature, interacting with increasing pressures from salinity and eutrophication. The spatially explicit risk output maps of invasions represent a powerful visual product for use in communication of the spread of NIS and decision-support tools for scientists and policymakers. The suggested approach, the observed distribution pattern and driving processes can be applied to other NIS species and regions by providing novel forecasts of species occurrences under future multiple stressor scenarios and the location of suitable recipient habitats with respect to anthropogenic and environmental parameters.

AB  - A large amount of the pollution of modern cities is caused by individual transportation. Hence, many road users suffer from stress, emissions and noise. Smart mobility services can help improving the situation by distributing traffic more consistently across different routes, times, and transportation modes. These services comprise two dimensions, a technical and a socio-technical. The latter addresses the road user's role as data and knowledge provider and stresses the road user's role in actively contributing to relieved traffic. As such, road users display one of the strongest levers to sustainably relieve traffic both in terms of knowledge providers and traffic actors. Using a systematic analysis of 28 publications, we show that existing SMob services show several challenges related to the involvement of road users. We call for more research on SMob services that account for long-term user involvement e.g. by positively influences road users' practices and routines.

AB  - The interplay between finance and technology with the use of the internet triggered the emergence of digital payment technologies. Such technological innovation in the payment industry is the foundation for financial inclusion. However, despite the continuous progress and potential of moving the payment landscape towards digital payments and connecting the population to the ubiquitous digital environment, some critical issues need to be addressed to achieve a more harmonious inclusive and sustainable cashless society. The study aims to provide a comprehensive literature review on the emerging digital payment technologies and associated challenges. By systematically reviewing existing empirical studies, this study puts forward the state-of-the-art classification of digital payment technologies and presents four categories of digital payment technologies: card payment, e-payment, mobile payment and cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, the paper presents the key challenges in digital payment technologies categorized into broad themes: social, economic, technical, awareness and legal. The classification and categorization of payment technologies and associated challenges can be useful to both researchers and practitioners to understand, elucidate and develop a coherent digital payment strategy.

AB  - Bottom trawling is the most widespread human activity affecting seabed habitats. Here, we collate all available data for experimental and comparative studies of trawling impacts on whole communities of seabed macroinvertebrates on sedimentary habitats and develop widely applicable methods to estimate depletion and recovery rates of biota after trawling. Depletion of biota and trawl penetration into the seabed are highly correlated. Otter trawls caused the least depletion, removing 6% of biota per pass and penetrating the seabed on average down to 2.4 cm, whereas hydraulic dredges caused the most depletion, removing 41% of biota and penetrating the seabed on average 16.1 cm. Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95% of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1.9 and 6.4 y. By accounting for the effects of penetration depth, environmental variation, and uncertainty, the models explained much of the variability of depletion and recovery estimates from single studies. Coupled with large-scale, high-resolution maps of trawling frequency and habitat, our estimates of depletion and recovery rates enable the assessment of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales.

AB  - Purpose of Review Resilience is a key concept to deal with an uncertain future in forestry. In recent years, it has received increasing attention from both research and practice. However, a common understanding of what resilience means in a forestry context and how to operationalise it is lacking. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the recent forest science literature on resilience in the forestry context, synthesizing how resilience is defined and assessed. Recent Findings Based on a detailed review of 255 studies, we analysed how the concepts of engineering resilience, ecological resilience and social-ecological resilience are used in forest sciences. A clear majority of the studies applied the concept of engineering resilience, quantifying resilience as the recovery time after a disturbance. The two most used indicators for engineering resilience were basal area increment and vegetation cover, whereas ecological resilience studies frequently focus on vegetation cover and tree density. In contrast, important social-ecological resilience indicators used in the literature are socio-economic diversity and stock of natural resources. In the context of global change, we expected an increase in studies adopting the more holistic social-ecological resilience concept, but this was not the observed trend. Our analysis points to the nestedness of these three resilience concepts, suggesting that they are complementary rather than contradictory. It also means that the variety of resilience approaches does not need to be an obstacle for operationalisation of the concept. We provide guidance for choosing the most suitable resilience concept and indicators based on the management, disturbance and application context.

AB  - Scholars from different perspectives agree that agritourism can be the right tool to balance the needs of tourists with those of rural communities, offering real opportunities for economic and social development, while mitigating undesirable impacts on the environment. This paper aims to provide a holistic outlook of the different perspectives under which scientific literature deals with the topic of agritourism as a means to support the sustainable development of rural areas. To reach this aim, we performed a systematic review of the scientific literature in order to point out the linkages between agritourism and sustainability. We analyzed papers through a text mining solution based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to point out the main topics around which the scientific literature on agritourism and sustainability has grown. Topics are further categorized in themes by means of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. Results are further analyzed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the current streams of the literature.

AB  - Aims. The aim of this systematic review of economic evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence concerning cost-effectiveness analyses of common treatment options for major depression.
   Methods. An existing database was used to identify studies reporting cost-effectiveness results from RCTs. This database has been developed by a systematic literature search in the bibliographic databases of PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase and Cochrane library from database inception to December 2014. We evaluated the quality of economic evaluations using a 10-item short version of the Drummond checklist. Results were synthesised narratively. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was assessed, based on the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.
   Results. Fourteen RCTs were included from the 5580 articles screened on titles and abstracts. The methodological quality of the health economic evaluations was relatively high and the majority of the included RCTs had low risk of bias in most of Cochrane items except blinding of participants and personnel. Cognitive behavioural therapy was examined in seven trials as part of a variety of treatment protocols and seems cost-effective compared with pharmacotherapy in the long-term. However cost-effectiveness results for the combination of psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy are conflicting and should be interpreted with caution due to limited comparability between the examined trials. For several treatments, only a single economic evaluation was reported as part of a clinical trial. This was the case for comparisons between different classes of antidepressants, for several types of psychotherapy (behavioural activation, occupational therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, short-term psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, rational emotive behavioural therapy, solution focused therapy), and for transcranial magnetic stimulation v. electroconvulsive therapy. The limited evidence base for these interventions means generalisations, based on economic evaluation alongside clinical trials, cannot easily be made.
   Conclusions. There is some economic evidence underpinning many of the common treatment options for major depression. Wide variability was observed in study outcomes, probably attributable to differences in population, interventions or follow-up periods. For many interventions, only a single economic evaluation alongside clinical trials was identified. Thus, significant economic evidence gaps remain in the area of major depressive disorder.

AB  - A physical geographers' scope of practice is not defined by any regulatory or academic organization, so perception of the potential contribution of physical geography to sustainability research has been nebulous or informal, at best. In order to understand what physical geographers can do to enhance sustainability, this paper describes a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on sustainability published in three physical geography journals. The results show that physical geographers are active in sustainability research in terms of a spatial perspective, an understanding of human interactions with the environment, and an ability to recognize, interpret, and project environmental change and its impacts. The depth of this understanding is facilitated by a physical geographers' understanding of the natural world, process and system concepts, the ways that systems are linked and interact, and a willingness to deploy a wide range of methodologies to secure that knowledge. The expertise of physical geographers makes an important contribution to sustainability research and should be considered when multidisciplinary teams are assembled.

AB  - Purpose of Review(1) To develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the Saami people; (2) to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of climate change on Saami culture and Sapmi region; and (3) to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well-being of the Saami.
   Recent Findings The Saami health is on average similar, or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area. Warming climate has already influenced Saami reindeer culture. Mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns.
   Summary The lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the Saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of Saami. Possibilities for Saami to adapt to climate change are limited.

AB  - With the increasing attention and awareness of the ecological environment, ecotourism is becoming ever more popular, but it still brings problems and challenges to the sustainable development of the environment. To solve such challenges, it is necessary to review literature in the field of ecotourism and determine the key research issues and future research directions. This paper uses scientometrics implemented by CiteSpace to conduct an in-depth systematic review of research and development in the field of ecotourism. Two bibliographic datasets were obtained from the Web of Science, including a core dataset and an expanded dataset, containing articles published between 2003 and 2021. Our research shows that ecotourism has been developing rapidly in recent years. The research field of ecotourism spans many disciplines and is a comprehensive interdisciplinary subject. According to the research results, the evolution of ecotourism can be roughly divided into three phases: human disturbance, ecosystem services and sustainable development. It could be concluded that it has entered the third stage of Shneider's four-stage theory of scientific discipline. The research not only identifies the main clusters and their advance in ecotourism research based on high impact citations and research frontier formed by citations, but also presents readers with new insights through intuitive visual images.

AB  - Hydro-hazards are increasing in frequency due to climate change which has inspired a cultural change in Flood Risk Management (FRM). Uncertainty associated with climate change has resulted in a shift towards flood resilience as it helps deal with unexpected climatic perturbations that impact extreme flows. The concept of resilience has increased in popularity, leading to a multitude of definitions, measurements and applications. This paper systematically reviews the FRM literature to provide clarity on the differing perspectives of resilience and how they influence successful implementation of the concept. Our analysis assesses where FRM is positioned within three pre-defined interdisciplinary understandings of resilience. The polysemic nature of resilience has produced a multitude of different perspectives that prevent successful operationalisation. Resilience is interdisciplinary; therefore it requires integration between top-down and bottom-up FRM approaches, as well as a more holistic approach to the interdependence between temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - CONTEXT: Mixed farming and agroforestry systems (MiFAS) are widely proposed to deal with ecological, eco-nomic, and social challenges that are associated with specialised farming systems. However, little is known about how MiFAS are integrated in food value chains and how value creation in MiFAS is rewarded by value chain actors. OBJECTIVE: We review the broad literature on MiFAS (80 papers) with a particular focus on implications for food value chains. METHODS: We use thematic analysis to code existing evidence and categorise these codes into four major themes: MiFAS value creation, Impacts of the farming environment on value creation, Ecosystem service valuation, and Supply & value chain integration. From here, we produce meta-narratives to summarise the literature within each theme. In a second step, we use these literature insights to develop possible value chain configurations that operationalise MiFAS in food value chains. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We find that: a) integrating farming enterprises tends to improve yields and land -use efficiency and can reduce variable costs; b) MiFAS seem to face significant challenges with respect to fixed costs, such as of capital investments, and of labour; c) high opportunity costs associated with MiFAS can be a drawback for farms seeking to become more integrated as limited knowledge and the time to establish profitable MiFAS can deter adoption; d) sources of value creation within MiFAS stem from its ability to reduce variable costs as well as maintain or raise inputs, primarily by improving the efficiency of resources such as nutrients and land; and e) inter-farmer partnerships and collaboration have the potential to shorten MiFAS supply chains and extend value capture for farmers by allowing them greater ownership of value created. SIGNIFICANCE: In total, insights into value chain implications of MiFAS are scarce. Therefore, our research delivers important implications for future research on MiFAS that should focus more on value chain implications of this emerging food production system.

AB  - Resilience is a multidisciplinary concept that deals with rapid response and recovery of a system experiencing a disruption. Despite extensive research on this topic, there is a need to clarify resilience concepts in the context of road freight transportation systems (FTSs) from a three-dimensional perspective (i.e., physical infrastructure, users, and managing organizations) and to identify persistent knowledge gaps concerning the characterization and measurement of FTS resilience vis-a-vis disruptive events. This paper addresses these shortcomings through a systematic review of 149 research studies. The synthesis of findings clarifies inconsistencies associated with the characteristics of FTS resilience and in so doing, establishes a unified framework for measuring FTS resilience through the life cycle of disruptive events. Critical data gaps, methodological shortcomings, and a lack of empirical evidence concerning FTS resilience to disruptive events remain. More robust analytical approaches are required to incorporate interdependencies among FTS dimensions into resilience assessments.

AB  - Interest in eco-innovation in the corporate environment has grown considerably in recent years. Given the profound role of eco-innovation, it is therefore important to obtain a better understanding on the latest research progress in the academia and the recent organizational efforts in practice. This review paper addresses this need and contributes to the current literature in three ways. First, this paper presents a descriptive overview on eco-innovation in the corporate environment by examining 395 representative articles published from 2006 to 2015, collected from the Social Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. The characteristics of the terminologies and journals, prevailing themes and changes, the geographical location of prolific authors and main geographical context of research studies in eco-innovation are identified to unravel the evolution of the concerned research studies and institutional contexts. Second, by using co-word and social network analyses, this study finds that the current literature on eco-innovation in the corporate environment is mainly focused on nine areas, including the influence of stakeholders, drivers of eco-innovation, eco-innovation systems, eco-design, new product developments, product service systems, environmental management systems, green supply chain management, and performance & small medium enterprises (SMEs). Third, this study provides an extended conceptual framework that incorporates the notion of 'driver -> source -> position -> performance' (D -> S -> P -> P) to find the relationships among the research topics in the eco-innovation field. This framework allows examination of the overall strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment so that a firm can gain a competitive edge through their adoption, implementation, assessment, and investment. This systematic review will benefit practitioners and academics by providing the major strands of research in the current studies on eco-innovation. This study also provides insights into four distinctive features of eco-innovation in the corporate environment as well as research gaps of recent eco-innovation studies. This study thus provides future research directions for subsequent eco-innovation research, as well as insights for managers and policy makers on how to enhance and strategize strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment.

AB  - In postconflict settings, a substantial number of injuries and related disabilities are caused by land mines and explosive remnants of war. This article reviews the literature on the prevalence of these injuries and subsequent disabilities in Cambodia and Lao PDR. Three major electronic databases were systematically for publications on the prevalence of these injuries. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Five of these were in Cambodia and 1 in Lao PDR. None of these studies could estimate national prevalence rates of these injuries; only 2 considered the broader impact of related disabilities. The different methodological approaches and limitations of the studies prevented statistical synthesis. The studies reviewed suggested accurate estimates of the prevalence of war injuries and consequent disabilities are missing. There is a need for a comprehensive epidemiological research to quantify the burden that results from such injuries.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of death in children under age five. Healthcare policy and other decision-making relevant to PTB may rely on obsolete, incomplete or inapplicable research evidence, leading to worsened outcomes. Appropriate knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) strategies are an important component of efforts to reduce the global PTB burden. We sought to develop a 'landscape' analysis of KTE strategies currently used in PTB and related contexts, and to make recommendations for optimising programmatic implementation and for future research.
   Methods: In the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative, we convened a multidisciplinary working group and examined KTE frameworks. After selecting a widely-used, adaptable, theoretically-strong framework we reviewed the literature to identify evidence-based KTE strategies. We analysed KTE approaches focusing on key PTB stakeholders (individuals, families and communities, healthcare providers and policymakers). Guided by the framework, we articulated KTE approaches that would likely improve PTB outcomes. We further applied the KTE framework in developing recommendations.
   Results: We selected the Linking Research to Action framework. Searches identified 19 systematic reviews, including two ;reviews of reviews'. Twelve reviews provided evidence for KTE strategies in the context of maternal, neonatal and child health, though not PTB specifically; seven reviews provided 'cross-cutting' evidence that could likely be generalised to PTB contexts. For individuals, families and communities, potentially effective KTE strategies include community-based approaches, 'decision aids', regular discussions with providers and other strategies. For providers, KTE outcomes may be improved through local opinion leaders, electronic reminders, multifaceted strategies and other approaches. Policy decisions relevant to PTB may best be informed through the use of evidence briefs, deliberative dialogues, the SUPPORT tools for evidence-informed policymaking and other strategies. Our recommendations for research addressed knowledge gaps in regard to partner engagement, applicability and context, implementation strategy research, monitoring and evaluation, and infrastructure for sustainable KTE efforts.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based KTE, using strategies appropriate to each stakeholder group, is essential to any effort to improve health at the population level. PTB stakeholders should be fully engaged in KTE and programme planning from its earliest stages, and ideally before planning begins.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with ruminant livestock production is important for climate change mitigation. Regenerative Agriculture (RA) practices are increasingly promoted to improve forage pro-duction and livestock performance in temperate livestock systems. These practices include i) rotational grazing (RG) of livestock around multiple subunits of pasture to achieve ungrazed periods of 'rest', and ii) herbal leys (HL), where perennial forbs such as chicory, lucerne and trefoils are included as components in multi-species swards. While there are plausible mechanisms for adoption of these practices to improve agricultural productivity, quantitative syntheses of their impacts are required. Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta -analysis of the effects of RG and HL practices on herbage dry matter (DM) production, animal daily live -weight gain (DLWG), and sheep wool growth in temperate oceanic regions. We use quantitative predictors in our Bayesian hierarchical models to investigate the role of rest period and stocking density in RG systems, and specific plant traits and sward diversity in HL. We found that herbage DM increased by 0.31 t.ha(-1) over a growing season as the proportion of rest in an RG grazing system increased from 0 to 1. Stocking density significantly moderated the effect of rest period on sheep and cattle DLWG; at higher stocking densities, longer rest periods were required to maintain livestock growth rates. In HL studies, herbage DM yielded 1.63 t.ha(-1) more per metre of increased sward root depth and a sward entirely comprised of legumes yielded 2.20 t.ha(-1) more than when no legumes were present. Sheep DLWG increased by 3.50 g.day(-1) per unit increase in leaf nitrogen concentration (mg.g(-1)), but we could not determine an effect of leaf condensed tannin content on animal performance. Although there remain differences between the RG and HL study treatments meta-analysed here and RA in practice, our results provide empirical support for some of the mechanisms attributed to increased pasture and livestock productivity following adoption of selected RA grazing practices.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic review of the Kano model in the tourism sector. The first research objective is to identify the fields under the tourism sector utilizing Kano's customer satisfaction model. The second goal is to study the application of the Kano model along with other methodologies for quality improvement in the tourism sector. 36 selected articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2003 and 2018 were systematically reviewed. Non-linear quality constructs were identified from different tourism sectors such as accommodation, attraction, food services, outdoor recreation, transportation, and travel & trade. The empirical study was found to be the most popular approach; Taiwan published most of the research in the field, followed by the USA, UK, Saudi Arabia, and India. The study will enable managers, marketers, and policymakers to recognize customer needs, enhance service quality, and develop sustainable tourism growth strategies. The paper highlights the non-linearity of service quality attributes in the overall tourism sector - an attempt that has not been made hitherto.

TI  - The prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of anaemia in South African pregnant women: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
LA  - English
KW  - Anaemia
KW  - Pregnancy
KW  - South Africa
AB  - Background: A significant cause of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy is maternal anaemia. The causes of anaemia and the sequelae are varied, and the prevention and management are public health challenges, especially in resource-limited settings and certain geographic locations. South Africa is plagued by a quadruple burden of disease, with high maternal mortality rates affected by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. This is most prevalent in people of lower socio-economic status. Poor nutrition, chronic infections, lack of access to health care facilities and poor compliance with micronutrient supplementation all contribute to maternal anaemia. The aim of this study is to systematically map the literature to ascertain the pooled prevalence and associated causes of anaemia in the South African pregnant population, which will enable health care workers and other key stakeholders to more pertinently address Sustainable Development Goal 3 focussing on good health and reducing maternal mortality.
   Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO, Ovid maternity and infant care databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science and SCOPUS will be searched using the keywords 'anaemia', 'haemoglobin', 'pregnancy', and 'South Africa' to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore, describe and map literature on the distribution and burden of anaemia in pregnant women in South Africa. The reference list of articles selected for review will be scanned for other articles of interest to our study question. Studies published in any language will be included in this review. As there may be differences in sampled populations in South Africa based on geography and sociodemographic factors, a weighted inverse-variance meta-analysis using a random-effects model will be carried out to generate a pooled prevalence estimate. A Funnel plot and Egger's regression test will be conducted to assess publication bias. Heterogeneity among studies will be checked usingI(2)to determine dispersion and meta-regression analysis will be performed to investigate the source of heterogeneity. The articles obtained by these searches will be analysed for causative factors, severity and outcomes by a parallel and independent review team, using suitable eligibility criteria. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal will be conducted independently by two authors. Disagreement will be resolved by independent assessment by a third reviewer. Sub group analysis by region, stage of pregnancy, socio-economic status, severity and cause of anaemia will be conducted if sufficient data is available. Data will be analysed using statistical software and presented in evidence tables and in meta-analytic forest plots.
   Discussion: This protocol is developed to systematically review the literature on the prevalence and severity of anaemia, risk factors and outcomes in pregnant women in South Africa. Correlation of factors contributing to the development of anaemia and other disorders during pregnancy will facilitate exploration of appropriate medical and behavioural change interventions implemented within other countries or regions that mitigate risk. This study will assist local health systems to inform public health policies and practises for more favourable maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Organisations of all types are significant contributors to international greenhouse gas emissions. The business case for supporting low-carbon practices is gathering pace, alongside the regulatory demands imposed through carbon emission compliance reporting. Despite this, guidance for generating carbon footprints through hybrid environmentally extended input-output analysis is under-developed and under-researched. Higher Education Institutions are key components of education systems across the globe, transcending international borders, socio-political regimes and economic systems. As an internationally significant sector beginning to address climate issues through carbon reduction policies on and off the estate, very few research articles have been published that document emissions arising from all directly and indirectly attributable activities. This study outlines a number of key elements to standardise the organisational carbon footprinting process by reconciling and evaluating the methodological steps in six selected internationally reputable guidelines (published by the Global Reporting Initiative, the Carbon Disclosure Project, the United Kingdom's Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the International Standardisation Organisation and the Higher Education Funding Council for England). A systematic review is undertaken which relates the four principles of carbon footprinting (boundary-setting, identification of activities, collecting of data and reporting/verification) to the academic literature. Then, via consultation with university environment managers, a number of recommendations are made to address and improve i) the potential to avoid double-counting, ii) the financial and resource cost of carbon footprinting and iii) the reliability and comparability of data compiled by institutions. We introduce a methodology for a universal, standardised footprinting standard for higher education (that could also apply to all organisations regardless of sector or region) with cut-off criteria that excludes paid-for products and services typically included in the 'Scope 3' proportion of the footprint. In proposing this methodology, carbon footprinting is made more applicable to higher education institutions (since existing standards are designed for generality and for profit-driven organisations) and the practical issues, associated with externally owned data and non expert staff, are broadly overcome.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSF) have long been overshadowed by the concerns and perceived importance of the industrial sector in fisheries science and policy. Yet in recent decades, attention to SSF is on the rise, marked by a proliferation of scientific publications, the emergence of new global policy tools devoted to the small-scale sector, and concerted efforts to tally the size and impacts of SSF on a global scale. Given the rising tide of interest buoying SSF, it's pertinent to consider how the underlying definition shapes efforts to enumerate and scale up knowledge on the sector-indicating what dimensions of SSF count and consequently what gets counted. Existing studies assess how national fisheries policies define SSF, but to date, no studies systematically and empirically examine how the definition of SSF has been articulated in science, including whether and how definitions have changed over time. We systematically analyzed how SSF were defined in the peer-reviewed scientific literature drawing on a database of 1,723 articles published between 1960 and 2015. We coded a 25% random sample of articles (n = 434) from our database and found that nearly one-quarter did not define SSE Among those that did proffer a definition, harvest technologies such as fishing boats and gear were the most common characteristics used. Comparing definitions over time, we identified two notable trends over the 65-year time period studied: a decreasing proportion of articles that defined SSF and an increasing reliance on technological dimensions like boats relative to sociocultural characteristics. Our results resonate with findings from similar research on the definition of SSF in national fisheries policies that also heavily rely on boat length. We call attention to several salient issues that are obscured by an overreliance on harvest technologies in definitions of SSF, including dynamics along the wider fisheries value chain and social relations such as gender. We discuss our findings considering new policies and emerging tools that could steer scientists and practitioners toward more encompassing, consistent, and relational means of defining SSF that circumvent some of the limitations of longstanding patterns in science and policy that impinge upon sustainable and just fisheries governance.

AB  - Greater one-homed rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is one of the most iconic wildlife species in the world. Once reduced to fewer than 500 during the 1960s, its global population has been recovering and is now over 3500, thanks to effective conservation programs in India and Nepal, the only two countries in the world where this species is found. It is one of the greatest success stories in biodiversity conservation given that hundreds of other species have disappeared, and thousands of species are on the verge of extinction. However, poaching is not the only threat for the long-term survival of rhinoceros. Loss and degradation of grassland habitat and the drying-up of wetlands are emerging threats predicted to worsen in the future, but the published information on rhinoceros has never been synthesized. In order to better understand the trends and current status of rhinoceros research and identify research gaps inhibiting its long term conservation, we analyzed the themes discussed in 215 articles covering a period of 33 years between 1985 and 2018. Our findings suggest that studies on both free ranging and captive rhinoceros are skewed towards biological aspects of the species including morphology, anatomy, physiology, and behaviour. There are no studies addressing the likely effects of climate change on the species, and limited information is available on rhinoceros genetics, diseases, habitat dynamics and the impacts of tourism and other infrastructure development in and around rhinoceros habitat. These issues will need addressing to maintain the conservation success of greater one-homed rhinoceros into the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of guidelines is to reduce practice variability, but they need to be evidence-based. We examine current mild traumatic brain injury guidelines, critique their basis in evidence and examine their variability in recommendations. A systematic search of the literature found 38,806 abstracts, with 41 guidelines. There were 18 sports-related guidelines, 13 related to admission policies, 12 related to imaging and 5 related to neuropsychological assessment. Some guidelines addressed several areas. Only 5 guidelines reported a methodology for the assembly of evidence used to develop the guideline. After appraising the guidelines against a validated index, we found that 3 of the 41 guidelines could be categorized as evidence-based. Two of these focused on paediatric patients and 1 on adult patients. Limited methodological quality in the current guidelines results in conflicting recommendations amongst them.

AB  - Microvascular decompression has been now accepted worldwide as a reasonable treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, yet, as a functional operation in the cerebellopontine angle, this process may be risky and the postoperative outcomes might not be good enough sometimes. To assess the effectiveness and safety of microvascular decompression for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, we conducted a systematic review. Using the keywords "trigeminal neuralgia", "microvascular decompression", or "neurovascular conflict", manuscripts published in English-language journals and indexed in PubMed between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2013 on the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with microvascular decompression were considered for this study. The success and complications were analyzed. The success in this investigation was defined as complete pain free. Continuous outcomes were summarized using means or medians, and dichotomous outcomes were presented as percentage associated with 95% confidence interval. Twenty-six papers with 6,847 patients were finally enrolled in this review. Among them, the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.4, the left-to-right ratio was 1:1.6, and the pain was located in the innervation of V3 and/or V2 in most of the cases with only 2.3% (0.1-4.7) of V1 exclusively. The average age at surgery was 60.9 years (52.5-64.1) with TN symptoms duration of 24.7 months (6.1-42.1) before microvascular decompression (MVD). Operative findings confirmed the superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, and multiple vascular contacts (including veins) as the most common sources of nerve compression. The average follow-up duration was 35.8 months (26.2-56.6). The success rate was 83.5% (79.6-89.1). Complications included incisional infection in 1.3% (0.1-2.5), facial palsy 2.9% (0.5-6.2), facial numbness 9.1% (1.3-19.6), cerebrospinal fluid leak 1.6% (0.7-2.5), and hearing deficit 1.9% (0.2-3.9). The postoperative mortality was 0.1% (0.02-0.2). Accordingly, MVD is the most effective treatment for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. An immediate pain free can be achieved by an experienced neurosurgeon with good knowledge of the regional anatomy. To avoid complications, each single step of the process cannot be overemphasized.

AB  - Purpose Farm businesses in England are under pressure to intensify production sustainably while managing costs and meeting market demands. Commodity prices and support from Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments are important determinants of profitability. With the United Kingdom (UK) leaving the European Union (EU), revised policy will see farming more exposed to fluctuating commodity prices and financial support from Government more focused on encouraging environmental land management. The research reported here, investigated whether business management practices of farmers influences financial performance, and how policy could be tailored to better meet the needs of farm businesses. Design/methodology/approach Regression models were estimated for 862 Cereals, Dairy and Livestock farms in England using official data for 2011-2012, in order to assess whether different farm characteristics, business management practices (identified from a systematic review of 102 studies), knowledge acquisition indicators and manager experience had an effect on four different financial performance ratios. The financial performance of the top 25% of the sample was also compared to the bottom 25% in terms of use of business management practices. Findings The results show that business planning and benchmarking had a positive, statistically significant, effect on financial performance, as do business size and knowledge acquisition, albeit to a lesser extent. Originality/value The research reported here is the most extensive examination, to date, of the impact of management practices on the financial performance of farms. Thus, it sends strong policy recommendations.

AB  - Strawberry (Fragaria x ananasa Duch.) is the most economically important soft fruit worldwide. While self- and wind-pollination is possible for strawberry, without biotic pollination (animal pollinators, including artificial pollination by humans) rate of strawberry flowers rarely exceeds 60% and thus fruit production is decreased. At a time of widely recognized decline of pollinators and increasing global demand for balanced food, we need a comprehensive understanding of the worldwide valuation of these ecosystem services. In this paper, we use a transparent and systematic review process to detect gaps in the available literature. By applying multilevel metaanalytic models, we quantified the contribution of biotic pollinators and different pollinator types to strawberry fruits. Our review showed that research on strawberry pollination is clearly concentrated in European countries, with limited information for Asia - the largest strawberry producer. Additionally, we detected disproportions across research topics, stressing the need for further research on pollinator preferences between strawberry cultivars and the occurrence of managed and wild bee communities. The overall estimate of pollination benefit to strawberry crops is on average a 25% reduction in fruit weight for plants not receiving a biotic pollination treatment. This benefit is similar regardless of the pollinating species. The mean amount globally (2011-2020) receivable by producers from purchasers due to biotic pollination is $5.36 billion per year. Moreover, we demonstrated that strawberry plants that are dependent on self- or wind-pollination set on average 43% fewer seeds (fertilized achenes) than biotically pollinated plants. Such a huge reduction in seed set can cause fruit deformation and reduce the commercial value of strawberries. Together, these findings indicate the critical role of biotic pollination in strawberry production and quality. To ensure pollination services in strawberry farms and produce the best-quality fruits, growers should take action to sustain healthy pollinator communities and utilize them with the optimal cultivar.

AB  - This urbanizing world necessitates our conservation efforts to protect vulnerable species from being pushed to extinction. To conserve the amazing winged creatures, detailed knowledge and understanding of ornithology are imperative. The present study aims to collate all the material on Chhattisgarh's ornithology and analyzes it to create a systematic review and checklist with conservation implications. All the available literature on avifauna including articles, reports, books and websites were reviewed for the present work. Literature was collected from online databases, web portals and sites such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Reports, Shodhganga, GBIF, and IUCN Red List. A total of 158 studies were found on avifauna starting from 1906 to 2022 from Chhattisgarh which was reviewed and analysed here. A total number of 502 bird species has been reported from the state so far. Among them, 49 species were identified as globally threatened as per IUCN Red List. Developing countries lose biodiversity due to rapid urbanization and heavy human pressure. Conserving the species in protected areas is not enough to arrest their population decline. Chhattisgarh needs landscape-level conservation to safeguard species, habitats, and ecosystems beyond protected areas. Nature education and awareness initiatives can help local populations protect biodiversity.

AB  - Dairy sheep farming systems provide a great range of ecosystem services (ESs) and social services (SSs). These are Agro-pastoral Secondary Outputs (ASOs), the promotion of which can help the survival of the systems and the rural regions in which they exist. However, little attention has been paid to understanding which ASOs are recognized by the public, which is the first step to adequately promote them. This study first aims to review previous literature on ASOs relating to livestock in general and dairy sheep farming systems in particular. The literature review, conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, revealed significant gaps. Second, the research provides evidence of public perception of ASOs of a given dairy sheep sector-i.e. that developed on the region of Sardinia (Italy)-via a questionnaire distributed to a composite sample of 525 stakeholders. We found that cultural and landscape services are the most appreciated services. Multiple correspondence analysis suggests that appreciation of a specific secondary output would imply the appreciation of all the other outputs. Furthermore, we ran a set of logit regressions where each ASO was related to several socio-economic variables. Findings showed, among others, that the 'subjective knowledge' of the Sardinian agro-pastoral reality positively and significantly affects appreciation of all the ASOs. Several implications for practitioners, academics and policymakers are derived from these findings.

AB  - Over the past three decades, research on the established linkages between solid waste management and psychological models has progressed rapidly. This informs statutory bodies that wish to design an effective solid waste management system. To further address this crucial task, this paper examined the existing literature on behavioral approaches applied to the study of solid waste. Through a systematic literature review approach, we identified, analyzed, and synthesized available literature across various geographical regions. Based on an analysis of 80 articles, we found that high-income countries (61%) are overrepresented in the existing literature, in which the USA (44%) has contributed the most. Most articles targeted recycling behavior (59%) by applying individual behavior theories (90%), in which the theory of planned behavior was widely tested (46%). In addition, 65% of the articles conducted model testing and 51% conducted empirical studies, revealing a dearth of evaluation studies in the literature. Cluster analyses revealed that psychological factors, comprising 34 variables, were extensively used, allowing future researchers to explore relevant variables from inter-disciplinary domains by adopting a pragmatic paradigm approach. In summary, this review identified four research gaps, recommended paths for future research, and concluded by highlighting the need of investigating social elements to tackle solid waste issues.
   Implications: The systematic review presented in this paper is an original contribution to the aforementioned body of knowledge. It makes the case for more researchers, teachers, and students to undertake behavioral projects, thus creating awareness among citizens to participate in waste management activities. The research gaps identified here also highlight the scope for future studies in under-explored areas and in the implementation of pro-environmental models to build a clean and green environment. Furthermore, the findings facilitate the formulation of pro-environmental laws, regulations, and policies in developing countries, where there is a higher need for strict environmental regulations focused on sustainability.

AB  - Nowadays, monitoring aspects related to sustainability and safety in mining activities worldwide are a priority, to mitigate socio-environmental impacts, promote efficient use of water, reduce carbon footprint, use renewable energies, reduce mine waste, and minimize the risks of accidents and fatalities. In this context, the implementation of sensor technologies is an attractive alternative for the mining industry in the current digitalization context. To have a digital mine, sensors are essential and form the basis of Industry 4.0, and to allow a more accelerated, reliable, and massive digital transformation, low-cost sensor technology solutions may help to achieve these goals. This article focuses on studying the state of the art of implementing low-cost sensor technologies to monitor sustainability and safety aspects in mining activities, through the review of scientific literature. The methodology applied in this article was carried out by means of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and generating science mapping. For this, a methodological procedure of three steps was implemented: (i) Bibliometric analysis as a quantitative method, (ii) Systematic review of literature as a qualitative method, and (iii) Mixed review as a method to integrate the findings found in (i) and (ii). Finally, according to the results obtained, the main advances, gaps, and future directions in the implementation of low-cost sensor technologies for use in smart mining are exposed. Digital transformation aspects for data measurement with low-cost sensors by real-time monitoring, use of wireless network systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital twins, and the Internet of Things, among other technologies of the Industry 4.0 era are discussed.

AB  - Hydropower plays an important role as the global energy system moves towards a less carbon-intensive and sustainable future as promoted under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article provides a systematic review of the impacts from policy, climate change and Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus on hydropower development at global scale. Asia, Africa and Latin America are hotspots promoting hydropower development with capacity expansion, while Europe and North America focus on performance improvement and environment impacts mitigation. Climate change is projected to improve gross hydropower potential (GHP) at high latitude of North Hemisphere and tropical Africa and decrease that in the US, South Africa and south and central Europe. Analysis from W-E-F nexus highlights the importance of integrated approaches as well as cross-sectoral coordination so as to improve resources use efficiency and achieve sustainable hydropower development. These three factors together shape the future of hydropower and need to be considered for planning and operation purpose. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review The demand for forest tree seedlings is increasing globally, and Sphagnum peat moss is widely used as a component of growing media for container plant production. However, peat extraction is environmentally unsustainable. The forest nursery sector needs to switch to more sustainable alternatives to peat. This review aims to identify potential substitutes for peat by reviewing the worldwide literature on alternative materials for growing media in forest nurseries. Recent Findings Most studies on alternative growing media focused on single plant species growing under local conditions, thereby limiting generalizations about the effectiveness of alternative materials for plant production. To our knowledge, no systematic reviews of scientific literature on the effectiveness of new, alternative-to-peat materials for enhancing plant growth and the associated growing media characteristics for the forest nursery sector are currently available. Summary Most of the analyzed case studies focused on angiosperms (73.1%), with the majority of studies coming from tropical seasonal forests/savannas (36.5%), followed by woodlands/shrublands (31.6%), and temperate forests (15.0%) biomes. Compost was the most studied material (19.5%), followed by bark, other organic materials, and manure (9.8, 9.7, and 8.0%, respectively). Green and municipal wastes were the principal sources of compost (> 60%), while agriculture and green wastes were the first sources of other materials (> 90%). Tested materials were dependent on the geographic region. Thus, manure was the most tested material in Africa and South America, tree bark in North America, and compost in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Alternative materials effectively provided optimal physicochemical characteristics of growing media and enhanced seedling nursery growth when compared with peat-based growing media in more than 60% of the case studies. This review helps to identify research gaps and, most importantly, provides the basis for the future application of alternative growing media materials in forest nursery management worldwide.

AB  - Sleep research has been dominated by high income countries (HIC). Sleep may be different in low and middle income countries (LMIC) due to cultural, demographic, geographical and health factors. We systematically reviewed the epidemiological literature reporting sleep parameters in the adult population in LMIC and meta-analyzed the prevalence of subjective poor sleep quality and sleep duration. We identified 45 publications; over 50% of which came from China and Brazil. Of the 45 identified studies, 32 contained data on sleep quality and 17 on self-reported sleep duration. Only one study utilized polysomnography and only one study utilized actigraphy. This review provides evidence that sleep parameters in LMIC appear to be similar to those in HIC but the variability and bias found suggests any attempt to extract a universal prevalence estimate or average sleep duration from the current data is very likely flawed and should be taken with caution. In our meta-analysis we found an enormous variability that was not explicable by regional, rurality, gender, age group or sleep assessment method. Further, there was a suggestion of significant small study effect, with smaller studies reporting worse sleep. There is surprisingly little consistent high-quality data that could be used for policy, planning, or scientific purposes at a global level in low and middle-income countries about what humans spend a third of their lives doing. High-quality epidemiological research about basic sleep health parameters is needed that focuses on the whole-population in LMIC, and that uses standardized, well-validated and culturally applicable measures.

AB  - Introduction Sports injuries are inevitable at any age. Often, rehabilitation methods vary widely and the time of readiness for a return to sport cannot be clearly determined. A function-based rehabilitation model in the form of the return-to-process algorithm could make the return to sport more structured based on test batteries and enable statements to be made about the functional capacity of the affected structure. So far, studies in this area have mainly focused on the lower extremity. The aim of this study is to present additional characteristics for the return-to-process of the upper extremity. Method The systematic review was based on the PRIS-MA guidelines. For the literature search, the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies. Based on the study results, the applied test procedures were compiled and compared. Results One cohort study, 6 case studies and 7 expert opinions met the inclusion criteria. At present, there is no standard definition for the application of the return-to process. The term return-to is also often used independently of rehabilitation measures to describe the return to sport. The organisation within the return-to-process differs significantly between the auto- rities. The test procedures used also showed little overlap. Readiness for return-to-process is not uniformly defined and is presented using both functional tests and strength tests. Transparent and athlete-centred decision-making in the interdisciplinary team, the integration of the biopsychosocial approach and a sustainable management of the load are recommended for a successful return-to-process. Conclusion The function-based rehabilitation approach of the return-to-process for the upper extremity requires a uniform definition of terms, as well as a defined test battery whose quality criteria have been scientifically proven. The return-to-process must include function- and strength-based tests and complementary components such as acute and chronic loading conditions.

AB  - Background
   Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a growing but neglected global health crisis, requiring effective prevention to promote sustainable safety. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) share a disproportionately high burden with 90% of the world's road traffic deaths, and where RTIs are escalating due to rapid urbanization and motorization. Although several studies have assessed the effectiveness of a specific intervention, no systematic reviews have been conducted summarizing the effectiveness of RTI prevention initiatives specifically performed in LMIC settings; this study will help fill this gap.
   Methods
   In accordance with PRISMA guidelines we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, TRID, Lilacs, Scielo and Global Health. Articles were eligible if they considered RTI prevention in LMICs by evaluating a prevention-related intervention with outcome measures of crash, RTI, or death. In addition, a reference and citation analysis was conducted as well as a data quality assessment. A qualitative metasummary approach was used for data analysis and effect sizes were calculated to quantify the magnitude of emerging themes.
   Results
   Of the 8560 articles from the literature search, 18 articles from 11 LMICs fit the eligibility and inclusion criteria. Of these studies, four were from Sub-Saharan Africa, ten from Latin America and the Caribbean, one from the Middle East, and three from Asia. Half of the studies focused specifically on legislation, while the others focused on speed control measures, educational interventions, enforcement, road improvement, community programs, or a multifaceted intervention.
   Conclusion
   Legislation was the most common intervention evaluated with the best outcomes when combined with strong enforcement initiatives or as part of a multifaceted approach. Because speed control is crucial to crash and injury prevention, road improvement interventions in LMIC settings should carefully consider how the impact of improvements will affect speed and traffic flow. Further road traffic injury prevention interventions should be performed in LMICs with patient-centered outcomes in order to guide injury prevention in these complex settings.

AB  - This article taps into the question of the materialized forms of theorizing in strategy: the strategy tools presented in publications over the past 25 years. This study conducts a systematic search and review of 482 published abstracts and 88 full text articles introducing tools to aid strategizing. The contribution of this study builds on the theoretical classification framework and review of strategy tools to illustrate what might be termed the toolbox of strategy from the publications in leading management journals. The review suggests that the landscape of strategy tools is surprisingly traditional and that contemporary developments in strategic thinking have not yet been transformed into usable tools. Furthermore, the study also provides some recommendations for the developers of new strategy tools in terms of topics and methodological considerations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water literacy, or the culmination of water-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, is a relatively new field of study with growing importance for sustainable water management and social water equity. However, its definition and use across existing literature are varied and often inconsistent. This paper seeks to synthesize and streamline the conception of water literacy. We conducted a systematic review of literature that defines or describes in detail either "water literacy" or "watershed literacy". From this, we suggest a new holistic framework for water literacy to guide a more inclusive, relevant use of the concept. We utilized the framework to examine existing surveys and studies of water knowledge, attitudes and behaviors in both student and adult populations, and summarized water literacy levels and knowledge gaps that exist around the world. To address knowledge gaps, we suggest using a suite of approaches drawn from the published literature, including enhanced visuals, place-based learning, interdisciplinary curricula, and reflective and iterative development of future water literacy initiatives.

AB  - Systematic knowledge of the development, trends, and limitations of wetland ecosystem services (WES) is extremely meaningful for the direction of WES studies and wetland management. A systematic literature review was conducted by collecting 1711 peer-reviewed articles through the Web of Science and ScienceDirect by searching the "topic" domain using the combined keywords "ecosystem service" OR "ecosystem services" and "wetland". The results indicated that current studies focus on WES evaluation, driving factors, wetland management, and policy design, which accounted for 90.9% of the obtained articles. The driving factors are mainly multiple factors, land use change, policy and management, and climate change. Riverine wetlands, multiple wetland types, and lacustrine wetlands are the main wetland types in existing studies, and the evaluated WES types are mainly supporting and regulating services. The applied evaluation approaches mainly include the biophysical and qualitative methods, which accounted for 76.4% and 14.3% of the total studies, respectively. Two main limitations in WES studies are a lack of unified WES evaluation indicators and comprehensive WES studies. In the future, WES research should focus on generating unified WES evaluation indicators for comparison across different studies and up-scaling. Long-term program should be established to gather data for creating ecological production functions to determine the marginal influence of wetland land characteristics on the final WES to refine the management options. Stakeholders should also be involved in the process of designing payments for ecosystem services programs. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The diversity of local conditions across regions has led to numerous challenges and opportunities for the implementation of global sustainability frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals. A grassroots transformative change led by local communities, cities, and businesses can offer a promising approach for achieving sustainability, tailored to the unique conditions of each context. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific and policy experiences, we explore some of the major challenges in local sustainability such as disagreements on local priorities, competing interests among various cohorts of stakeholders, and the risks posed by future uncertainties. We propose a transdisciplinary agenda based on the effective integration of computational approaches with genuine stakeholder engagement to mitigate these challenges. The proposed agenda is crucial for mobilizing collaborative efforts that enhance co-learning between scientists and stakeholders in the pursuit of sustainability across scales.

AB  - The digitalization of urban mechanisms relies on the integration of digital terrain and 3D city models. However, a systematic examination of this topic within the context of integrated smart cities or digital twins has been lacking, hindering reproducibility and interpretation of results. To address this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review to explore the role of digital terrain and 3D city models in supporting urban decision-making for integrated smart cities or digital twins. By following a review protocol, research questions were formulated, and systematic search strategies were implemented involving reputable databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Emerald, Taylor Francis, Springer Link, and Sage Journals. The review process included identification, screening, eligibility assessment, quality appraisal, data extraction, and thematic analysis. The thematic analysis identified eight main themes and 22 sub-themes, shedding light on various aspects of digital terrain and 3D city models in urban decision-making, including (1) data integration and interoperability, (2) integrated visualization; (3) environmental simulation; (4) digital twins application; (5) smart cities application; (6) semantic enrichment; (7) applied planning; and (8) urban planning. This systematic review identifies gaps in the field and provides directions for future studies.
   The Role of Digital Twins and Smart Cities in Urban Decision-Making: A Systematic Literature ReviewThis study addresses the digitalization of urban mechanisms and its reliance on the integration of digital terrain and 3D city models, particularly within the context of integrated smart cities or digital twins. Despite its significance, a systematic examination of this topic has been lacking, leading to challenges in reproducibility and interpretation of research findings. To bridge this gap, the study conducts a systematic literature review to explore the role of digital terrain and 3D city models in supporting urban decision-making. Following a rigorous review protocol, the study formulates research questions and implements systematic search strategies involving reputable databases. Key databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Emerald, Taylor Francis, Springer Link, and Sage Journals are used for comprehensive coverage. The review process includes stages such as identification, screening, eligibility assessment, quality appraisal, data extraction, and thematic analysis. The thematic analysis reveals eight main themes and 22 sub-themes, shedding light on various aspects of digital terrain and 3D city models in urban decision-making. These themes encompass data integration and interoperability, integrated visualization, environmental simulation, digital twins application, smart cities application, semantic enrichment, applied planning, and urban planning. The systematic review not only contributes to a better understanding of the role of digital terrain and 3D city models in urban decision-making but also identifies gaps in the field. By providing directions for future research, this study aims to enhance the development and application of integrated smart cities and digital twins, ultimately contributing to more effective and sustainable urban planning and management.

AB  - Purpose
   Knowledge protection (KP) is one of the main knowledge management (KM) processes that aim to protect the organization's knowledge from any inside and outside force leakage. In higher education institutions (HEIs), KP is rarely being discussed and covered in contrast to knowledge sharing (KS) in terms of its determinants. The purpose of this paper is to provide a deep analysis of previous research articles from 1980 to 2019 and examine the associated institutional factors on KP determinants within HEIs as a research objective.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis was a well-established approach for analyzing the systematic literature review methodology. Several articles were published over the past decades collected from 5 different databases, but after the screening, 101 articles were reviewed and only 22 articles were relevant to the research objective.
   Findings
   The findings indicated that KP is under academic research topic in KM and has received minimal attention in HEIs compared to KS, which has been frequently studied in HEIs. The literature categorized KP determinants into four areas: technological, organizational structure, behavioral and ethics and organizational culture. It will open the door for academics to investigate further into the factors, theories and models of KP in general and HEIs from a particular perspective.
   Practical implications
   As evident from the paper finds, with few pieces of literature covered in this topic, HEIs have to protect the knowledge from any illegal usage or any expert's knowledge loss after leaving the institutions. This study can help university leaders to understand how the different KP determinants can maximize KP without affecting the KS and develop the KP phenomenon for a strategic fit to enhance their institutions' safe knowledge usage.
   Originality/value
   This is the first research of its type which has extensively examined the literature on KP related to HEIs. Also, this paper provides theoretical and practical insights through understanding the determinants that affect KP practices among academic staff.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Cities, which now host the majority of the global population, are vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic disturbances, which are likely to increase in number and severity in the near future. Urban agriculture (UA) could help increase the resilience of cities to a range of pressures and acute shocks by improving food security and public health, building social capital, and promoting circular economies. However, comprehensive assessments of its potential are still lacking. Here, we use a systematic review of the literature on UA in the global North to identify factors that determine its success in providing resilience benefits, explore challenges that can limit this, and develop a conceptual model to highlight the ways in which it could be enhanced through research, policy, and practice. We define the success of UA in increasing city resilience as determined by five factors, which in turn depend on the amount of institutional and public support for UA, the presence of a sufficient knowledge base, communication and collaboration among different actors, and resourcefulness in finding alternative ways to use space and other resources efficiently. We close with a discussion of specific directions for research and practice based on the conceptual model developed here.

AB  - Background: The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption.
   Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.
   Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another.
   Results: A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback.
   Conclusions: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

AB  - Critical evaluation of treatment methods has become an important part of health care and will certainly have a major influence on decisions about acceptable treatment methods in the future. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) means the systematic, explicit, and judicious implementation of the best evidence in patient care. The most reliable sources of evidence are high-quality systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic EBM approach could be particularly useful in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMD), where controversial and conflicting ideas about management are common. In this field, concerns about the lack of evidence are often expressed. This article aims to elucidate and discuss the application of EBM to the treatment of TMD, using the most controversial treatments (ie, occlusal treatments) as an example. By applying the principles of EBM to TMD treatments, we wish to highlight some of the important. issues that form the basis for high-quality care in this field. A systematic review of occlusal treatments (occlusal splints and occlusal adjustment) updated to January 2003 revealed 16 RCTs of occlusal splints and 4 of occlusal adjustment. The overall quality of the trials was fairly low. Recently, however, some high-quality RCTs of occlusal splints have been published. The most obvious methodologic shortcomings in published trials included problems in defining the patient population, inadequacies in performing randomization and blinding, problems in defining the therapies or appropriate control treatments, short follow-ups, and problems in monitoring patient compliance. Occlusal splint studies yielded equivocal results. Even in the most studied area, stabilization splints for myofascial face pain, the results do not justify definite conclusions about the efficacy of splint therapy. Their clinical effectiveness to relieve pain also seems modest when compared with pain treatment methods in general. None of the occlusal adjustment studies provided evidence supporting the use of this treatment method. The clinical implications of the findings and future perspectives are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: A growing number of low- and middle-income countries are implementing small-scale community-based health insurance schemes to tackle the burdens posed by direct out-of-pocket payments. Apart from a few successful experiences, such schemes suffer from the problem of persistent low membership which could be attributed to either initial low enrollment or low renewal rate. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on the factors that influence subscribers' policy renewal decisions. Hence, we systematically synthesize information to answer the review question "what are the barriers and facilitators of community-based health insurance policy renewal in low and middle-income countries?".
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Hinari electronic databases in line with the PRISMA guidelines. Our search was limited to studies published from January 2005 to February 2020 in the English language. Additional studies and grey literature were searched using Google Scholar. We included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies in the review. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies using standardized appraisal tools. The findings were synthesized inductively using a thematic analysis approach.
   Results: Our searches retrieved 2386 records among which 27 were included in the review. The thematic synthesis identified six major themes that influence the decision to renew scheme policy: socio-demographic factors; scheme-related awareness and understanding; participation in scheme and other voluntary groupings, need and benefit factors; healthcare quality; and scheme operation and policy.
   Conclusion: Lower socioeconomic status, poor quality of health care, lack of benefit from the scheme, lack of trust in scheme management, and dissatisfaction with scheme services are important barriers for community-based health insurance policy renewal. Better education, understanding the principles of the scheme, active participation in the scheme, and long-term illness experience of member households facilitate renewal decisions. These are important areas of intervention for governments and other relevant stakeholders to retain members and maintain the sustainability of the schemes.
   Registration: The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (ID = CRD42020168971).

AB  - With the development of modern data processing, mining and collection technologies, various companies and institutions will have more opportunities to make these data operations faster and more efficiently. From the economic perspective, processing personal data is evidently lucrative and companies would therefore like to obtain as much data as possible. This paper analyses and summarizes existing and emerging social and economic trends, implications and issues caused by clashes between European legislation on personal data protection (the GDPR) and current data processing practices. Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data, the article attempts to scrutinize the implications of the conflict between the rising demand for privacy and personal data protection on the one hand and the ever-growing need to process and store personal data, especially by commercial organizations, on the other. Analysing databases, legislation, reports, statistical data and surveys, the paper attempts to provide an estimate of the value of personal data and the consequences of poor handling of personal data.

AB  - Rural buildings represent the functional relationship between rural communities and agricultural land. Therefore, research on rural buildings has practical repercussions on environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Comprehensive state-of-the-art research on rural buildings may address research activities. We present a systematic review of the scientific research between 2000 and 2022 based on the PRISMA protocol. Five main topics were identified. The results showed that the primary research focus was production (25.1%) and environmental management issues (23.2%). However, construction and efficiency are rapidly taking centre stage (20.6%). Regarding sustainability (20.8%), life cycle assessment, green buildings, recycling and global warming should be the future research focus. Energy efficiency will benefit from studies on thermal energy. More research on engineering and technologies (10.3%), specifically remote and automatic detection and transport in rural areas, will increase cost efficiency. The results may help improve the global efficiency of rural buildings in a modern farming system.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the existing literature and provide a comprehensive overview by compiling and synthesizing the dispersed body of knowledge in the networking capability (NC) literature stream. Therefore, this review study contributes to the research by presenting a summary of the NC complex construct.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors have tried to cover the literature gap in the NC area through a systematic review.
   Findings
   The theoretical contributions of this study to the NC literature stream are fourfold. First, while critically reviewing existing definitions, the authors present an integrated definition of NC. Second, the authors delineate the conceptual boundary between NC and other similar capabilities. Third, the authors found that the focal firms' NC consists of two key dimensions: network development capability (NDC) and network management capability (NMC). Fourth, they contribute to the literature by providing a set of suggestions for further research in the NC literature stream.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study has some limitations, like other review studies. First, although the authors have tried their best to conduct a comprehensive literature search, they may have missed a study. Second, it should be noted that this study has confined itself to a particular stream of literature. Undoubtedly, in other streams, there will be issues similar to the concepts discussed in this study. The main purpose of this study is to integrate a series of studies that have a common theoretical foundation and fall within a particular literature stream. Although the focus of this study may be positive, it can be said that the deprivation of achievements from other similar streams is one of the limitations of this study. Third, another limitation of this study is the lack of verification of the conceptual framework derived from the literature that needs to be addressed in future research.
   Practical implications
   This study suggests a set of practical implications for industrial managers. First, the authors summarize the firms' capabilities needed to develop and manage networks in one single source. Based on the conceptual framework of this study, firms can develop managerial tools, technological options, checklists and questionnaires and monitor the status of NC in their surrounding network on an ongoing basis. Second, the present research shows that some NCs are more repetitive than others, and therefore, it can be said that managers should pay more attention to them. The critical NCs, such as determining network position, determining network size, partner selection and attraction, coordination, inter-firm knowledge sharing and conflict resolution, are included in this study. Third, the argument of this study that both NDC and NMC should be considered simultaneously can be thought of as an important practical implication. Although in terms of the network life cycle, NDC is required earlier than NMC, these two capabilities should be used in parallel. Managers should not expect network development to be perfect and then network management to begin; therefore, NMCs should be used during network development.
   Originality/value
   Research shows that most network studies focus more on network antecedents and outputs and less on processes and related capabilities. Some researchers have made few efforts to identify and scrutinize capabilities related to business relationships. In this context, IMP scholars have introduced NC to emphasize the network perspective.
   Despite the considerable conceptual and empirical richness, the existence of different nomenclatures and theoretical diversity in NC literature has led to conceptual ambiguity and a lack of consensus on this crucial complex construct.

AB  - Permanent supportive housing is an effective intervention for stably housing most people experiencing homelessness and mental illness who have complex support needs. However, high-risk behaviours and challenges are prevalent among this population and have the potential to seriously harm health and threaten housing tenures. Yet, the research on the relationship between high-risk issues and housing stability in permanent supportive housing has not been previously synthesized. This rapid review aimed to identify the housing-related outcomes of high-risk behaviours and challenges in permanent supportive housing settings, as well as the approaches used by agencies and residents to address them. A range of high-risk behaviours and challenges were examined, including risks to self (overdose, suicide/suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury, falls/fall-related injuries), and risks to multiple parties and/or building (fire-setting/arson, hoarding, apartment takeovers, physical/sexual violence, property damage, drug selling, sex trafficking). The search strategy included four components to identify relevant academic and grey literature: (1) searches of MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL Plus; (2) hand searches of three journals with aims specific to housing and homelessness; (3) website browsing/searching of seven homelessness, supportive housing, and mental health agencies and networks; and (4) Advanced Google searches. A total of 32 articles were eligible and included in the review. Six studies examined the impacts of high-risk behaviours and challenges on housing tenancies, with overdose being identified as a notable cause of death. Twenty-six studies examined approaches and barriers to managing high-risk behaviours and challenges in PSH programs. These were categorized into eight types of approaches: (1) clinical, (2) relational/educational, (3) surveillant, (4) restrictive, (5) strategic, (6) design-based, (7) legal, and (8) self-defence. Consistent across all approaches was a lack of rigorous examination of their effectiveness. Further, some approaches that are legal, restrictive, surveillant, or strategic in nature may be used to promote safety, but may conflict with other program objectives, including housing stability, or resident empowerment and choice. Research priorities were identified to address the key evidence gaps and move toward best practices for preventing and managing high-risk behaviours and challenges in permanent supportive housing.

AB  - Blue carbon sinks (mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses) are considered an effective nature-based approach for climate change mitigation. Despite growing interest, a systematic review of this topic is still scarce. This study evaluated 1348 blue carbon sink-related articles from 1990 to 2020 using bibliometric technology. The results from total of 85 countries, 1538 institutions, and 4492 authors indicated that blue carbon sink research shows the characteristics of rapid growth. The most active country, institution, and author were USA, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Duarte C.M., respectively. Relatively close academic collaboration has formed in blue carbon science. Environmental Sciences was the most popular category with 590 papers. The percentages of articles related to mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses were 63.87%, 40.36%, and 40.65%, respectively. Mangrove carbon sinks are the most popular topic, and stable isotope and remote sensing are the most researched technologies for mapping and quantifying blue carbon sinks. The threats to blue carbon sinks are complex and distinctive. Restoration, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems aimed to improve their carbon sink capacity are becoming hot issues and should be further investigated in the future. These findings provide a scientific roadmap for further research in this field and will enable stakeholders to identify the research trend.

AB  - We report findings from a systematic review of literature on women's formal political participation in fragile and conflict-affected states. In many postconflict contexts, quotas for women's formal participation are introduced as part of restructuring the political and social landscape. While many women take part in formal politics, many more still experience inequalities determined by their gender positions. Our analysis assesses the evidence used to substantiate the support for the prevailing global policy prescription for women's participation in formal political structures and the impact of this on general gender equality. We explore the association and relevance between the available knowledge, evidential claims based on these and the prevailing policy and practice to advance gender equality. Good policies require in-depth knowledge about the field within which policies intervene. One of our central findings is that the research continues to produce knowledge about the mechanisms that help to elect women rather than knowledge on the gender outcomes of these processes within the larger society.

AB  - Effective leaders are critical in determining successful outcomes of conservation programs. As the business and economic leadership literature shows, awareness around cultural differences in leadership attributes is important for positive project outcomes set in inter-cultural contexts. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to understand whether, and how, the influence of cultural context was acknowledged when describing successful leadership attributes of conservation leadership. We found fifteen papers from different geographical regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America) explicitly addressing conservation leadership attributes. We further explored how characteristics of four key attributes (i.e. motivating others, establishing a shared vision, effective communication and partnership building) were addressed within these different cultural settings. Our review shows that the discourse on how culture influences attributes of a conservation leader and its implications for conservation outcomes is very limited. Awareness and sensitivity around this influence is important as cultural differences may either facilitate or hinder conservation project outcomes, particularly when people from different cultural backgrounds work together.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq) is an economically important crop, yet it plays a major role in tropical deforestation and has significant negative impacts on biodiversity. The ecological drivers of oil palm pollination are still poorly understood, despite pollination being a key ecosystem service for the yield of this multi-billion-dollar industry, with potential links to biodiversity conservation. Here we review biotic and abiotic drivers of pollination and known oil palm pollinators, including local insect species endemic to specific growing regions, and an important, globally-introduced West African weevil (Elaeidobius kamerunicus) whose fluctuating populations have led to concerns about yield and resilience. Future research should clarify pollinator community dynamics to facilitate pollination complementarity, which may strengthen pollination services in regions beyond the oil palm and weevil's native West African ecosystem. In addition, other interactions such as mutualism, predation, and parasitism are not yet well understood, but could provide further insight into population drivers. Future management research should explore manipulating male palm inflorescence density, a key resource for pollinators, as well as investigate spatial and landscape effects on pollinator populations. Critically, no studies have investigated the effects of climate change on pollination, despite the impacts of rain and temperature on pollination efficiency. A greater understanding of the role of pollinator species and their nonlinear relationships to yield, as well as the complexity of biotic, management, and climate drivers of successful pollination can contribute to a more sustainable oil palm production system that values ecosystem services gained from biodiversity, while also improving producer livelihoods.

AB  - Natural systems are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors and so understanding the interactive threats posed by multiple stressors is essential. In this study we focused on urban stressors that are ubiquitous to urban estuarine systems worldwide: elevated nutrients, toxic chemical contaminants, built infrastructure and non-indigenous species (NIS). We investigated structural (abundance, diversity and species richness) and functional endpoints (productivity, primary production (chlorophyll-a) and metabolism) commonly used to determine responses to these selected stressors. Through a systematic review of global literature, we found 579 studies of our selected stressors; 93% measured responses to a single stressor, with few assessing the effects of multiple stressors (7%). Structural endpoints were commonly used to measure the effects of stressors (49% of the total 579 studies). Whereas, functional endpoints were rarely assessed alone (10%) but rather in combination with structural endpoints (41%). Elevated nutrients followed by NIS were the most studied single stressors (43% and 16% of the 541 single stressor studies), while elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants were overwhelmingly the most common stressor combination (79% of the 33 multiple stressor studies); with NIS and built infrastructure representing major gaps in multi-stressor research. In the meta-analysis, structural endpoints tended to decrease, while functional endpoints increased and/or decreased in response to different types of organisms or groups. We predicted an antagonistic effect of elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants based on the opposing enriching versus toxic effects of this stressor combination. Of note, biodiversity was the only endpoint that revealed such an antagonistic response. Our results highlight the continuing paucity of multiple stressor studies and provide evidence for opposing patterns in the responses to single and interacting stressors depending on the measured endpoint. The latter is of significant consequence to understanding relevant impacts of stressors in coastal monitoring and management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NBS) have begun receiving growing attention for their potential in addressing strong sustainability challenges. Having recognized slow progress in shipping sustainability, this study aims to explore the NBS-related approaches for shipping following the connections between NBS and the requirements of shipping sustainability in their theoretical bases, objectives, and implications. Through a systematic literature review, this study finds long-range NBS-related applications in shipping although NBS discourse in shipping emerged recently. Despite some differences in the specific functions of relevant NBS approaches, the better management, restoration, or conservation of ecosystems and the creation of new ecosystems have been identified to move sustainability forward. However, limitations of the literature review such as relying much on the existing publications, not covering all alternatives, and lacking outcomes measurement exist. More practical knowledge, case studies, quantitative measurements, and modelling are further suggested to help build evidence-based NBS information bases to support sustainability in shipping, complementary to current engineering and technological sustainability solutions.

AB  - Land-use change has transformed the majority of the terrestrial biosphere, impacting biodiversity, climate change, food production and provision of multiple ecosystem services. To improve our understanding of land-use change processes, the motivations and characteristics of land-use decision-makers need to be addressed more explicitly. Here, we systematically review the peer-reviewed literature between 1950 and 2018 that documents decision-making underlying land-use change processes. We found 315 publications reporting on 559 case studies worldwide that report on land-use decision-making in sufficient depth. In these cases, we identified 758 land-use decision-makers. We clustered decision-makers based on their objectives, attitudes and abilities into six distinct types: survivalist, subsistence-oriented smallholder, market-oriented smallholder, professional commercialist, professional intensifier and eco-agriculturalist. Survival and livelihood were identified as most common objectives for land-use decision makers, followed by economic objectives. We observe large differences in terms of decision-makers' attitudes towards environmental values, and particularly their financial status, while decision makers have a generally favorable attitude towards change and legislation. The majority of the documented decision-makers in the literature have only few abilities as they are poor and own small plots of land, while the wealthier decision-makers were identified to have more power and control over their decisions. Based on a representativeness analysis, we found that decision-making processes in marginal areas, such as mountainous regions, are overrepresented in existing case study evidence, while remote areas and lowlands are under-represented. These insights can help in the design of better land-use change assessments, as well as to improve policies towards sustainable land use.

AB  - A suggested mechanism for the success of introduced non-native species is the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). Many studies have tested the predictions of the ERH using the community approach (native and non-native species studied in the same habitat) or the biogeographical approach (species studied in their native and non-native range), but results are highly variable, possibly due to large variety of study systems incorporated. We therefore focused on one specific system: plants and their herbivorous insects. We performed a systematic review and compiled a large number (68) of datasets from studies comparing herbivorous insects on native and non-native plants using the community or biogeographical approach. We performed a meta-analysis to test the predictions from the ERH for insect diversity (number of species), insect load (number of individuals) and level of herbivory for both the community and biogeographical approach. For both the community and biogeographical approach insect diversity was significantly higher on native than on non-native plants. Insect load tended to be higher on native than non-native plants at the community approach only. Herbivory was not different between native and non-native plants at the community approach, while there was too little data available for testing the biogeographical approach. Our meta analysis generally supports the predictions from the ERH for both the community and biogeographical approach, but also shows that the outcome is importantly determined by the response measured and approach applied. So far, very few studies apply both approaches simultaneously in a reciprocal manner while this is arguably the best way for testing the ERH.

AB  - Land use science has traditionally used case-study approaches for in-depth investigation of land use change processes and impacts. Meta-studies synthesize findings across case-study evidence to identify general patterns. In this paper, we provide a review of meta-studies in land use science. Various meta-studies have been conducted, which synthesize deforestation and agricultural land use change processes, while other important changes, such as urbanization, wetland conversion, and grassland dynamics have hardly been addressed. Meta-studies of land use change impacts focus mostly on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, while meta-studies of socioeconomic consequences are rare. Land use change processes and land use change impacts are generally addressed in isolation, while only few studies considered trajectories of drivers through changes to their impacts and their potential feedbacks. We provide a conceptual framework for linking meta-studies of land use change processes and impacts for the analysis of coupled human-environmental systems. Moreover, we provide suggestions for combining meta-studies of different land use change processes to develop a more integrated theory of land use change, and for combining meta-studies of land use change impacts to identify tradeoffs between different impacts. Land use science can benefit from an improved conceptualization of land use change processes and their impacts, and from new methods that combine meta-study findings to advance our understanding of human-environmental systems.

AB  - The great challenges induced by global climate change coupled with rapid urbanization underline the growing urgency for a change in stormwater management with a novel integrated approach. This study conducted a comprehensive review on state-of-the-art knowledge in the research field of green storm infrastructure (GSI) using bibliometric analysis. A corpus of 3988 GSI-related publications (2000-2021) extracted from the Web of Science database was used to evaluate the scientific output in GSI research through the "Bibliometrix" R package and "CiteSpace". Ever since 2010, the number of publications per year exhibited an exponential increase, with the annual publication growth rate of 28.61%. Notably, the United States (23.55%) and China (19.58%) contributed most in GSI publications. "Water" (306) was identified as the most relevant journal in GIS research field, followed by "Sustainability" (252) and "Science of the Total Environment" (200). Cluster analysis unveiled the predominant research themes, i.e., "Conceptual development of GSI" (69.25%), "Adaptation of GSI" (46.89%), and "Performance evaluation of GSI practices" (18.28%). Research foci have generally shifted from conventional engineering-based frameworks (e.g., reduce stormwater runoff and enhance water quality) to ecological-based multi-elements (e.g., preserve natural resources, augment urban biodiversity and optimize landuse patterns). This systematic review concludes trends, challenges and future research prospects of GSI, and aims to provide reference and guidance for decision-makers on the development of a more dynamic, resilient, and robust integrated GSI approach for sustainable urban stormwater management.

By analyzing 31 empirical studies on entrepreneurial teams, the current study fulfilled three main purposes. First, we conduct a comprehensive, systematic review of the possible association between entrepreneurial team diversity and performance by summarizing, quantitatively synthesizing, and analyzing the quantitative studies in this area. Second, we further examine these theoretical accounts by evaluating whether diversity impact varies with situational factors. Third, we identify research gaps and propose an integrated model that directs future research.

AB  - A new movement in urban environmental policy, the circular economy (CE), aims to change how Europeans consume and produce materials and energy. Cities are taking up the CE challenge. This research inquires whether the infant CE programs in European cities include cultural heritage and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (ARCH) buildings. ARCH buildings exemplify the central principal of the CE, which is a temporally long service life with multiple uses for several generations of users. In addition, culture and cultural heritage buildings are established drivers of socioeconomic development, urban landscape, and identity. Hypothetically, cultural heritage and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage (ARCH) buildings should be prominently included in European cities' CE programs, particularly those cities that are highly ranked on the 2019 European Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (Monitor). To test this hypothesis, this study creates a novel dataset that profiles the existing circular city plans of 190 European cities included in the Monitor's ranking. Contrary to the hypothesis, just seven percent of cities in the dataset include cultural heritage. European cities are missing an opportunity to achieve their CE goals and preserve their unique identities as embodied in the built environment.

AB  - Increasing droughts and water shortages are intensifying the need for residential water conservation. We identify and classify 24 water conservation studies using the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model by categorizing interventions based on content and water conservation effectiveness. This synthesis revealed several insights. First, all of the interventions used information, motivation, and/or behavioral skills, suggesting that water conservation interventions can be interpreted within the IMB framework. Second, interventions with two or more IMB components led to reductions in water usage, but the average effect sizes between different types of interventions were similar and there was a considerable range around these averages. To the extent that intervention effectiveness is driven by populations lacking specific IMB components, more elicitation research to identify gaps in specific populations could support greater effectiveness. Designing interventions explicitly with the IMB model would facilitate comparability across studies and could support a better understanding of water conservation interventions.

AB  - Highly specialised biota occurring at hydrothermally active vents on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (nMAR: from south of Iceland to the Equator) have been the subject of numerous research projects over the 36-year period since these habitats were first discovered in the region. When hydrothermal activity ceases, biota endemic to hydrothermally active habitats are lost, and a new biota colonise these sites. Little is known about the biota colonising hydrothermally inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR, although these sites may be the target of deep-sea mining within the next decade. In this review, we seek to clarify the current knowledge of biological communities colonising hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR. To achieve this, we (1) used a systematic review process to update the species list of benthic invertebrates associated with hydrothermally active habitats, (2) conducted a regional biogeographic analysis of hydrothermally active vent fields on the nMAR, (3) undertook a comprehensive literature review to provide a descriptive account of biological communities, and (4) identified key knowledge gaps in the current understanding of nMAR hydrothermally active and inactive ecosystems. Our updated species list increases the number of benthic invertebrates recorded from hydrothermally active habitats on the nMAR to 158 taxa. Our regional biogeographic analysis separates nMAR hydrothermal vent fields into distinct clusters based on depth/latitude and chimney composition. Vent fields close to the Azores (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow) formed a separate cluster from those at greater depths south of the Azores (Broken Spur, TAG, Snake Pit, Logatchev, and Ashadze-1). Moytirra, located north of the Azores, clustered separately, as did Lost City with its unique carbonate chimneys. We present detailed information on the biological communities at hydrothermally active and inactive habitats in this region, and discuss the information available on the diversity, ecosystem function, trophic relationships, connectivity, temporal variability, and resilience and recovery of these communities. Many knowledge gaps still exist, with detailed information needed on all aspects of the biological communities at hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR to understand and predict impacts from natural and human-induced disturbances in the region.

AB  - Systems engineering tools and methodologies are increasingly being used in urban planning and sustainable development applications. Such tools were previously extensively used for urban planning during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, only to result in high profile failures and pushback from urban planners, politicians, and the public. In order to better understand why this occurred, what has changed, and how we can avoid such failures moving forward, this study conducts a systematic review and an integrative review of the systems engineering and critical literature. These reviews are used to identify eight common pitfalls and organize them into key themes. Technological and methodological developments that may address each of these pitfalls are considered and recommendations are made for future applications of systems engineering to planning contexts. Finally, examples are provided of systems engineering being used productively in a way consistent with these recommendations for sustainable development applications.

AB  - The "Ecological Value" (EV) term has been spread in the literature since 1860; however, there is no consensus on its definition and the criteria for its assessment. To identify, assess and summarize the main definitions, criteria, indicators and applications behind the EV term, we performed a systematic literature review of 209 articles published over the last 10 years. Methods included documentation of the following data: i) study area, ii) study subject, iii) study object; iv) criteria, indicators and methods used in the analyses, v) applications of the EV term, and vi) if the study was performed in a natural protected area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to uncover the association among studies regarding the use of EV and to test for homogeneity among the articles publishing research involving EV. A bootstrap technique was used for MCA validation. The main findings exposed the polysemy of the term and the paucity in the definition, mainly derived by the lack of a theoretical framework. Only 74, out of the 209 revised articles, involved numerical analysis to evaluate criteria. The more recurrent criteria were those related with ecological properties (biodiversity, vulnerability) and with functional characteristics (fragmentation, connectivity and resilience). Remote sensing techniques were the more frequent method for the assessment of EV. The main applications in the use of this term were for natural and urban planning, biodiversity conservation and payment for ecosystem services. An explicit heterogeneity among articles, with and without numerical analysis, was denoted by MCA. Finally, we concluded that the EV term is highly related with the intrinsic values of the landscape.

AB  - When drivers encounter a traffic conflict, making a prompt and correct decision to take evasive actions is crucial to prevent collisions. Therefore, studying information processing in drivers' decision-making is essential for driving safety. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews reporting guidelines, the aim of this scoping review was to map current studies on drivers' decision-making in such situations. Our search strategy identified 2,506 peer-reviewed articles, out of which 20 were selected. The results indicated that the selected studies mainly measured drivers' decision-making less holistically by focusing only on the perception phase instead of measuring the entire information processing phase involved in decision-making. Additionally, these studies explored interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the environment less comprehensively. There are opportunities to explore drivers' decision-making in traffic conflict situations further, and this scoping review presents several challenges for further research and some strategies for overcoming them.

AB  - Adopting Regenerative Agriculture (RA) practices on temperate arable land can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration without reducing crop yields. RA is therefore receiving much attention as a climate change mitigation strategy. However, estimating the potential change in national soil carbon stocks following adoption of RA practices is required to determine its suitability for this. Here, we use a well-validated model of soil carbon turnover (RothC) to simulate adoption of three regenerative practices (cover cropping, reduced tillage intensity and incorporation of a grass-based ley phase into arable rotations) across arable land in Great Britain (GB). We develop a modelling framework which calibrates RothC using studies of these measures from a recent systematic review, estimating the proportional increase in carbon inputs to the soil compared to conventional practice, before simulating adoption across GB. We find that cover cropping would on average increase SOC stocks by 10 t.ha(-1) within 30 years of adoption across GB, potentially sequestering 6.5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year (MtCO(2).y(-1)). Ley-arable systems could increase SOC stocks by 3 or 16 t.ha(-1), potentially providing 2.2 or 10.6 MtCO(2).y(-1) of sequestration over 30 years, depending on the length of the ley-phase (one and four years, respectively, in these scenarios). In contrast, our modelling approach finds little change in soil carbon stocks when practising reduced tillage intensity. Our results indicate that adopting RA practices could make a meaningful contribution to GB agriculture reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions despite practical constraints to their uptake.

AB  - BackgroundAltering food store environments is a promising approach to encourage healthy product purchases by consumers to improve their diet quality and health. Food store owners and managers are intermediaries to ensure that environmental changes are enacted. Despite their role as gatekeepers to implement and sustain healthy food environment changes, no systematic review has been published that examines food store owner and manager (retailer) data. Thus a review of retailer information available within the expansive United States (US) food environment literature was the purpose of this research.MethodsThe PRISMA protocol was used. A search strategy, including published articles from years 1980-2017, was applied to six databases to locate relevant articles that addressed the perspective of food store retailers in the US. Data were extracted, organized, and agreed upon between two authors based on pre-designed constructs: (1) a social-ecological model to capture factors that influence retailer decision making; and (2) a marketing-mix and choice-architecture framework to examine perspectives of applied (or the prospective application of) strategies at the store-level. Study quality was assessed using quality criteria checklists for qualitative and quantitative research.ResultsThirty-one articles met inclusion criteria and most studies (n=22) were qualitative and conducted in urban food stores (n=23). Multiple social-ecological factors influenced retailer decision making and ability or willingness to use marketing-mix and choice-architecture strategies to improve consumers' healthy choices to support dietary quality. These factors included: conflicting training outcomes to enhance retailers' knowledge and skills (individual, n=9); the importance of trust (interpersonal, n=8); views about marketing-mix and choice-architecture strategies in the food environment (n=25); consumer demand or demographics (community, n=19); supplier and food store management variables (systems or sectors, n=18); local and federal policy (n=8); and support for community health (norms/values, n=8).ConclusionsResearch partnerships can support favorable business and public health outcomes to align with retailers' business models and available resources. A participatory and translational approach to food environment research will likely maximize public health impact. Urban and rural food store retailers are important actors for future research to inform the feasibility of store retailers to apply MMCA strategies that are profitable and promote health.

AB  - Social network analysis (SNA) is a significant tool for analyzing networks in complex project management that examines the actors' interdependence in iterative and interactive social structures. It can also be used for nonsocial structure analysis. The potential of SNA might be extended significantly if the application of it to complex project management is clarified. The objectives of the present review are threefold: (1) to clarify the interpretation of SNA metrics, (2) to identify SNA applications to complex-project-management knowledge areas, and (3) to reveal the uses of SNA in nonsocial structures of complex networks. The authors conducted a qualitative systematic review on the basis of 65 peer-reviewed publications to identify 38 SNA metrics and concepts in nine complex-project-management knowledge areas. The findings show that SNA is a useful tool for application to the analysis of nonhuman resource networks and can be used for strategic planning and the improvement of project transmission efficiency and interdisciplinary interactions. The authors also delineate future studies and potential applications of SNA to provide new insights into advancing the use of SNA for analyzing and mitigating complex-project-management issues.

AB  - Rangeland degradation compromises the functioning of extensive natural ecosystems and threatens pastoral livelihoods worldwide. Yet, defining rangeland degradation and its underlying causes remains controversial. In this study we review rangeland studies to identify different approaches used to assess rangeland degradation in Mongolia, where the prevalence of degradation is frequently referenced in media and policy documents. We compiled studies addressing rangeland degradation, with a special emphasis on the grey literature, to assess: 1) how different studies defined and quantified rangeland degradation; 2) whether a theoretical background was explicitly mentioned; 3) which drivers of degradation were identified and whether their effects were quantified; and 4) the distribution of the studies across relevant environmental gradients. We found 114 studies published between 1950 and 2021. Degradation was frequently assessed as a change in vegetation or land cover, but there was no standard definition of rangeland degradation and only a few studies explicitly defined contrasting degradation levels (19 studies). Less than one third of studies (27) referred to a theoretical framework. Grazing and climate (precipitation and temperature), alone or in combination, were most frequently mentioned as drivers of degradation but the impact of different drivers differed across ecological zones. The majority of studies were conducted in the steppe, forest steppe and desert steppe zones of central Mongolia. Future studies should consider the differences in ecological potential of each rangeland and quantify the relative importance of different drivers in each ecological zone. Emerging initiatives for rangeland assessment and monitoring that use long-term data collection following standardized methodologies based on robust theoretical frameworks hold promise for the design of policies and strategies for sustainable land use in Mongolia.

AB  - Traffic calming (TC) has been applied widely for several decades, although approaches to evaluating its effects on speeds have been inconsistent. This resulted in limited comparable and robust evidence to support practitioner guidance for TC design. To fill this gap and suggest best practices for the evaluation of TC effects on speeds, we performed a systematic review of 158 publications. We distilled information related to five research questions: Which measurement sensor was used? How was speed measured? Was free-flow speed considered? What was the sampling density? How were sample considerations reported? In addition to coding the studies based on these research questions, we rated them based on scientific robustness. The review confirmed the inconsistent state of evaluation practice. Most common evaluation approaches employed static detectors, low levels of control for bias (simple before-after), and unknown survey periods. The review found that the most robust evaluation practices involved multivariate before-after or cross-sectional study designs, used dynamic measurement of speeds (e.g., probe vehicles, simulations), large samples of vehicles, and more precise evaluation of speed changes using speed-distance graphs. These findings could guide more consistent and robust evaluation practice, and thus help to improve evidence-based TC guidance for creating safer and more sustainable neighborhoods.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to conduct a systematic review of the literature on supply chain collaboration published over a 10-year period from 2005 to 2014. It explores the nature and extent of research undertaken to identify key themes emerging in the field and gaps that need to be addressed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a sample of 207 articles from 69 journals, after using an iterative cycle of defining appropriate search keywords, searching the literature and conducting the analysis.
   Findings - Key themes include the meaning of collaboration; considerations for supply chain collaboration theory; emerging areas in collaboration for sustainability, technology-enabled supply chains and humanitarian supply chains; and the need for a more holistic approach, multi-tier perspectives and research into B2C collaborations.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper provides discussion and scope for future research into the area which would contribute to the field tremendously.
   Originality/value - There have been very few reviews in the past on supply chain collaboration, and this is one of the first extensive reviews conducted to address how well the body of knowledge on supply chain collaboration corresponds with our contemporary society.

AB  - Species richness and endemism are significant features of biodiversity, so taxonomic reviews can change the basis of biodiversity conservation issues. A recent review of the Tasmanian endemic freshwater crayfish genus Parastacoides has identified 14 species, rather than the single species (consisting of three sub-species) previously recognized.
   Most of the range of Parastacoides lies within the WHA (Western Tasmania World Heritage Area), and since the previous sub-species had widespread distributions, they were thought to be well-protected. However, several of the newly recognized species lie outside the protected area, and some have very restricted distributions. This raises new conservation issues, as these species may be vulnerable to man made threats such as forestry, mining and hydro-electric power development. The issues extend beyond the conservation of Parastacoides species themselves, since some of them are keystone species in their effects on soils and the provision of habitat for other invertebrates.

AB  - Although multiple bibliometric studies have been conducted to analyze publications on various topics within tourism, little attention has been dedicated to systematically analyzing scholarly production on the topic of tourism sustainability. Consequently, this paper aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric and systematic review of tourism sustainability. The collected data include 6326 publications retrieved from the Scopus database. The bibliometric technique consists of two major analyses: one on the domain (levels of analysis) and one on knowledge structures. The results indicated a remarkable evolution of tourism sustainability research involving authors, sources, and publications on this subject. Several associations and nations made significant contributions to this theme. Moreover, science mapping approaches were used to thoroughly grasp tourism sustainability-related research's social, intellectual, and conceptual structure. By giving in-depth overviews and insights connected to tourism sustainability and its knowledge structures, this review article has various implications for scientific study and practice.

AB  - Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), as trainers of critical citizens and a vision of a more sustainable world, must be examples of sustainable organizations, as the way to defend sustainability is to believe and incorporate their practices in their daily lives. In this context, the central scope of the study analyzed sustainability through the use of a set of indicators at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology Education (IF), Campo Novo de Parecis campus, in the State of Mato Grosso. The methodology used is qualitative and quantitative, descriptive and as a technical procedure the systematic review of literature and documentary research. The main results reveal that four studies were searched in Brazil, based on the selection criteria, a total of 209 indicators were selected, and these were compiled into a set of 96 indicators, consistent and with the potential to be used as a reference for assess sustainability at IF Campo Novo de Parecis. It is concluded that the fragile / unsatisfactory indicators that deserve attention by the IF, Campo Novo de Parecis campus are linked to water, hazardous waste, socio-environmental sustainability and responsibility programs, among others (Labor exercises, Dental plan, Paper reuse, Sustainable landscaping and parking control).

AB  - With the emerging demand for electric bikes (e-bikes), the design of sustainable mobility infrastructure should account for the level-of-service (LOS) of e-bikes. However, knowledge about e-bike LOS (ELOS) is scarce. We review recent advancements in hindrance-based approaches and microsimulation models to provide insights into the development of ELOS measures for off-road facilities. We discuss challenges associated with the data collection and existing LOS estimation approaches, all of which help shape future research agendas to develop the ELOS index. Our review suggests that future hindrance-based studies should focus on quantifying relative discomfort generated due to passing and meeting encounters. Similarly, future microsimulation-based LOS studies should improve the physical model to mimic meeting event frequencies and develop models for the homogeneous flow of e-bikes. These findings are crucial to integrating hindrance-based and microsimulation approaches in developing the ELOS index, an essential metric for the ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of off-road facilities.

AB  - Solar powered steam generation is an emerging area in the field of energy harvest and sustainable technologies. The nano-structured photothermal materials are able to harvest energy from the full solar spectrum and convert it to heat with high efficiency. Moreover, the materials and structures for heat management as well as the mass transportation are also brought to the forefront. Several groups have reported their materials and structures as solutions for high performance devices, a few creatively coupled other physical fields with solar energy to achieve even better results. This paper provides a systematic review on the recent developments in photothermal nanomaterial discovery, material selection, structural design and mass/heat management, as well as their applications in seawater desalination and fresh water production from waste water with free solar energy. It also discusses current technical challenges and likely future developments. This article will help to stimulate novel ideas and new designs for the photothermal materials, towards efficient, low cost practical solar-driven clean water production.

AB  - Green spaces and nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly considered by land-use planning policies to respond to the multiple challenges related to sustainable development. The multiple benefits brought by NBS make the use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) essential to optimally balance their use. MCDA offers a catalog of methods allowing to structure problems with multiple objectives and to help adopt the optimal solution. However, NBS planning is a recent discipline and research is still ongoing to make this practice more common. We carried out a critical literature review on MCDA-NBS tools and practices. We conducted our literature research following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method on the Web of Science database and we selected 124 papers on the subject between 2000 and 2022. We present a state-of-the-art MCDA approach for NBS and green space planning by looking at where these practices are applied, why and how this process is conducted, and who is involved in it. We found that studies are usually conducted in the global North on a single case study with the help of experts involved in the criteria weighting phase and the help of GIS-MCDA tools often integrating a direct ranking method or the AHP method.

AB  - Social innovation and high-quality agricultural systems are important for rural development. However, there is little information on methods for measuring the process and outcome of social innovation, particularly at the regional level. This study aimed to answer the research question: Which social innovation metrics can be applied to analyze rural development at the regional level? We carried out a systematic review of the literature on factors and indicators of social innovation, assessed the characteristics of social innovation in value-added agricultural production systems in developed countries, and proposed social innovation indicators for evaluating value-added agricultural systems in developing countries. Key elements of the process and outcome dimensions of social innovation were identified and used to generate factors, subfactors, indicators, and subindicators. The literature review showed that more research is needed on the outcomes of social innovation. Future studies should investigate the social transformations promoted by rural tourism and biodiversity valorization.

AB  - Accommodation and lodging are an integral component of the tourism and hospitality industry. Given the sectors' growing contribution to resource consumption and waste, there is a growing body of literature on the attitudes, behaviours and practices of consumers, managers, staff and owners of lodging with respect to sustainability. This paper presents the results of a systematic analysis of articles on attitudes, behaviours and practices of consumers and the provision of accommodation with respect to sustainability. The results indicate that there is a dearth of longitudinal studies on the sustainability of practices and behaviours. There are limitations in geographical coverage as well as methods, with research dominated by convenience sampling approaches. It is concluded that while there appear to be improvements in the potential sustainability of lodging with respect to technological approaches, the lack of systematic long-term studies on behavioural interventions represents a significant challenge to reducing the absolute emissions of the sector as well as reductions in energy and water use and waste production. Given the lack of longitudinal studies, it is not known whether observed behavioural changes are sustained over time.

AB  - Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly in recent decades. This large-scale land-use change has had great ecological, economic, and social impacts on both the areas converted to oil palm and their surroundings. However, research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation is scattered and patchy, and no clear overview exists. We address this gap through a systematic and comprehensive literature review of all ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, including several (genetic, medicinal and ornamental resources, information functions) not included in previous systematic reviews. We compare ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations to those in forests, as the conversion of forest to oil palm is prevalent in the tropics. We find that oil palm plantations generally have reduced ecosystem functioning compared to forests: 11 out of 14 ecosystem functions show a net decrease in level of function. Some functions show decreases with potentially irreversible global impacts (e.g. reductions in gas and climate regulation, habitat and nursery functions, genetic resources, medicinal resources, and information functions). The most serious impacts occur when forest is cleared to establish new plantations, and immediately afterwards, especially on peat soils. To variable degrees, specific plantation management measures can prevent or reduce losses of some ecosystem functions (e.g. avoid illegal land clearing via fire, avoid draining of peat, use of integrated pest management, use of cover crops, mulch, and compost) and we highlight synergistic mitigation measures that can improve multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously. The only ecosystem function which increases in oil palm plantations is, unsurprisingly, the production of marketable goods. Our review highlights numerous research gaps. In particular, there are significant gaps with respect to socio-cultural information functions. Further, there is a need for more empirical data on the importance of spatial and temporal scales, such as differences among plantations in different environments, of different sizes, and of different ages, as our review has identified examples where ecosystem functions vary spatially and temporally. Finally, more research is needed on developing management practices that can offset the losses of ecosystem functions. Our findings should stimulate research to address the identified gaps, and provide a foundation for more systematic research and discussion on ways to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts of oil palm cultivation.

AB  - Alteration of natural flow regime is considered a major threat to biodiversity in river floodplain ecosystems. Measurements of quantitative relationships between flow regime change and biodiversity are, however, incomplete and inconclusive. This hampers the assessment of human impact on riverine floodplain wetlands in global biodiversity evaluations. We systematically reviewed the scientific literature and extracted information from existing data sets for a meta-analysis to unravel a general quantitative understanding of the ecological consequences of altered flow regimes. From 28 studies we retrieved both ecological and hydrological data. Relative mean abundance of original species (mean species abundance, MSA) and relative species richness were used as effect size measures of biodiversity intactness. The meta-analysis showed that alteration of a natural flow regime reduces the MSA by more than 50 % on average, and species richness by more than 25 %. Impact on species richness and abundance tends to be related to the degree of hydrological alteration. These results can be used in strategic quantitative assessments by incorporating the relationships into global models on environmental change and biodiversity such as GLOBIO-aquatic.

AB  - Background: Relative to their counterparts in the general population, young people who leave, or transition out of, out-of-home (OOHC) arrangements commonly experience poorer outcomes across a range of indicators, including higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, reliance on public assistance, physical and mental health problems and contact with the criminal justice system. The age at which young people transition from OOHC varies between and within some countries, but for most, formal support ceases between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs designed to support transitions are generally available to young people toward the end of their OOHC placement, although some can extend beyond. They often encourage the development of skills required for continued engagement in education, obtaining employment, maintaining housing and general life skills. Little is known about the effectiveness of these programs or of extended care policies that raise the age at which support remains available to young people after leaving OOHC. This systematic review will seek to identify programs and/or interventions that improve outcomes for youth transitioning from the OOHC system into adult living arrangements.
   Methods: This review will identify programs, interventions and policies that seek to improve health and wellbeing of this population that have been tested using robust controlled methods. Primary outcomes of interest are homelessness, health, education, employment, exposure to violence and risky behaviour. Secondary outcomes are relationships and life skills. We will search, from January 1990 onwards, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment. Grey literature will be identified through searching websites and databases, e.g. clearing houses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research on this topic area. Two reviewers will independently screen all title and abstracts and full text articles with conflicts to be resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be undertaken by pairs of review authors, with one reviewer checking the results of the other. If more than one study with suitable data can be identified, we plan to undertake both fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses and intend to present the random-effects result if there is no indication of funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias will be assessed using tools appropriate to the study methodology. Quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.
   Discussion: Previous reviews were unable to identify any programs or interventions, backed by methodologically rigorous research, that improve outcomes for this population. This review seeks to update this previous work, taking into account changes in the provision of extended care, which is now available in some jurisdictions.

AB  - Governance of food systems is a poorly understood determinant of food security. Much scholarship on food systems governance is non-empirical, while existing empirical research is often case study-based and theoretically and methodologically incommensurable. This complicates aggregation of evidence and generalization. This paper presents a review of literature to identify a core set of methodological indicators to study food systems governance in future research. Indicators were identified from literature gathered through a structured consultation and sampling from recent systematic reviews and were classified according to governance levels and the food system activity domain they investigate. We found a concentration of indicators in food production at local to national levels and with less literature investigating how food governance affects food distribution and consumption. Many indicators of institutional structure were found, while indicators capturing social agency and indicators of cross-scale dynamics were moderately represented but critical perspectives on governance were lacking. These gaps present an opportunity for future empirical research to investigate more comprehensively the diverse components of food systems and how governance arrangements at different scales affect them.

AB  - Strategic planning's popularity in public organizations cannot be denied, with legislative initiatives even making it mandatory for certain public organizations. Due to strategic planning's continued popularity in practice, recent years have seen a surge in research on the topic. A synthesis of said research is necessary to identify empirical, conceptual, theoretical, and methodological challenges that remain to be tackled. Drawing from a systematic review of 75 studies through a Strategy-as-Practice lens, this paper contributes to public management theory, research, and practice in three significant ways. First, it provides a structured synthesis and integration of a growing and disparate body of literature, offering a roadmap for future research on strategic planning in public organizations. Second, it proposes a middle-range theoretical framework that captures the complex and dynamic nature of strategic planning in public organizations, providing insight into how strategic planning is conducted and why it may or may not work in certain contexts. Finally, it offers practical relevance for public managers and other public professionals by providing an overview of the various strategic planning choices available and how to optimize them according to their unique contexts and desired outcomes.

AB  - Background: Community-based health insurance (CBHI) has evolved as an alternative health financing mechanism to out of pocket payments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in areas where government or employer-based health insurance is minimal. This systematic review aimed to assess the barriers and facilitators to implementation, uptake and sustainability of CHBI schemes in LMICs.
   Methods: We searched six electronic databases and grey literature. We included both quantitative and qualitative studies written in English language and published after year 1992. Two reviewers worked in duplicate and independently to complete study selection, data abstraction, and assessment of methodological features. We synthesized the findings based on thematic analysis and categorized according to the ecological model into individual, interpersonal, community and systems levels.
   Results: Of 15,510 citations, 51 met the eligibility criteria. Individual factors included awareness and understanding of the concept of CBHI, trust in scheme and scheme managers, perceived service quality, and demographic characteristics, which influenced enrollment and sustainability. Interpersonal factors such as household dynamics, other family members enrolled in the scheme, and social solidarity influenced enrollment and renewal of membership. Community-level factors such as culture and community involvement in scheme development influenced enrollment and sustainability of scheme. Systems-level factors encompassed governance, financial and delivery arrangement. Government involvement, accountability of scheme management, and strong policymaker-implementer relation facilitated implementation and sustainability of scheme. Packages that covered outpatient and inpatient care and those tailored to community needs contributed to increased enrollment. Amount and timing of premium collection was reported to negatively influence enrollment while factors reported as threats to sustainability included facility bankruptcy, operating on small budgets, rising healthcare costs, small risk pool, irregular contributions, and overutilization of services. At the delivery level, accessibility of facilities, facility environment, and health personnel influenced enrollment, service utilization and dropout rates.
   Conclusion: There are a multitude of interrelated factors at the individual, interpersonal, community and systems levels that drive the implementation, uptake and sustainability of CBHI schemes. We discuss the implications of the findings at the policy and research level.

AB  - Climate change and habitat loss are both key threatening processes driving the global loss in biodiversity. Yet little is known about their synergistic effects on biological populations due to the complexity underlying both processes. If the combined effects of habitat loss and climate change are greater than the effects of each threat individually, current conservation management strategies may be inefficient and at worst ineffective. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify whether interacting effects between climate change and habitat loss exist and, if so, quantify the magnitude of their impact. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of studies that quantify the effect of habitat loss on biological populations and examine whether the magnitude of these effects depends on current climatic conditions and historical rates of climate change. We examined 1319 papers on habitat loss and fragmentation, identified from the past 20 years, representing a range of taxa, landscapes, land-uses, geographic locations and climatic conditions. We find that current climate and climate change are important factors determining the negative effects of habitat loss on species density and/or diversity. The most important determinant of habitat loss and fragmentation effects, averaged across species and geographic regions, was current maximum temperature, with mean precipitation change over the last 100 years of secondary importance. Habitat loss and fragmentation effects were greatest in areas with high maximum temperatures. Conversely, they were lowest in areas where average rainfall has increased over time. To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a global terrestrial analysis of existing data to quantify and test for interacting effects between current climate, climatic change and habitat loss on biological populations. Understanding the synergistic effects between climate change and other threatening processes has critical implications for our ability to support and incorporate climate change adaptation measures into policy development and management response.

AB  - Based on an analysis of the struggles of the Nahua peoples of Milpa Alta in Mexico City, this article addresses the following question: How has it been possible to conserve large extensions of forest and agricultural land in a demarcation that is part of one of the largest cities in the world, in rapid expansion since the middle of the last century? The explanation articulates two key categories: reconfigured communality in Milpa Alta through historical struggles that continue to unfold to date; and the social metabolism of human-nature exchanges mediated by the work of various agencies, whose projects come into conflict at different times. We argue that the re-creation of indigenous forms of organization and collective practices have made it possible to curb the extraction of raw materials (wood and water) and land-use change for development projects promoted by government agencies and private companies; in addition to contributing to the conservation of small-scale agricultural practices. The analysis is based on semi-structured interviews that were carried out between 2016 and 2020 with inhabitants of Milpa Alta and on a systematic review of bibliographic, newspaper, statistical, and online sources.

AB  - ContextVector-borne diseases (VBD) are a worldwide public health problem for humans and wildlife. 'Global Change' such as habitat alteration and land-use intensification, biotic exchange, the introduction of invasive alien species, and climate change have all been linked to an increased occurrence of VBDs.ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of land-use and land-cover (LULC) on the transmission of VBDs, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature on the global effects of land use on VBDs. This was followed by a meta-analysis to test the relationship between LULC intensification and infection prevalence.MethodsOverall, 654 articles met our inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review, and 18 studies fulfilled the requirements for the meta-analysis.ResultsThe systematic literature review identified 162 articles with a total of 2541 data entries on the effect of LULC on VBDs. The majority of the studies were published after 2010, and the spatial distribution of data was biased towards North America and Europe. Overall, 193 different hosts and 144 different vector groups were identified. Avian and human malaria were the most frequently named diseases, with humans and Anopheles mosquitoes the most common host and vector, respectively. Our meta-analysis found that land-use intensity, as well as targets (host and vector), significantly impact the prevalence of VBDs. Tests for both residual heterogeneity and moderators were significant, where lower land-use intensity and vectors were linked to lower VBD prevalence, while medium land-use intensity was associated with higher prevalence. Analysis of the host sub-model supported these findings, with infection prevalence significantly lower in low land-use intensity.ConclusionsThe systematic literature review revealed a temporal increase in publications on this topic, with a significant rise since 2007 and uneven distribution of data across countries, with the United States, Spain, and Brazil being the most prominent contributors and identified a wide range of pathogens and hosts involved in VBD systems, with human and avian malaria being the most commonly mentioned diseases. We also show, through a meta-analysis, that LULC intensification affects VBDs infection prevalence. Future studies should incorporate the effects of land-use intensity on vector-borne diseases in diverse ecosystems to inform management strategies and mitigate disease emergence with implications for human, livestock and wildlife health.

AB  - The concept of 'less but better' meat lacks clarity. A shared vision of livestock systems and meat consumption needs to be outlined to guide decision-makers towards food system sustainability.
   'Less but better' is a pragmatic approach to tackling the sustainability challenges of meat consumption and production. Definitions of 'less' and 'better' lack clarity. Here we explore interpretations of these concepts, finding increasing use of 'less but better' in the literature from Western, high-income settings. Despite discrepancies among interpretations of 'less' meat, existing quantifications indicate that significant reduction is needed to achieve desirable food system outcomes. Interpretations of 'better' meat incorporate the delivery of environmental sustainability, improved animal welfare and better health or nutrition, but lack clear principles and omit many sustainability themes. Practices and outcomes are seldom linked, and diverging narratives on interactions between 'less' and 'better' exist. A shared vision of livestock systems with improved sustainability across multiple indicators is needed to establish principles for 'less but better' in order for decision-making to deliver desired outcomes.

AB  - For a generation, governments around the world have been committed to sustainable development as a policy goal. This has been supported by an array of new policies ranging from international agreements, to national strategies, environmental laws at many levels of government, regional programs, and local plans. Despite these efforts, decades of scientific monitoring indicate that the world is no closer to environmental sustainability and in many respects the situation is getting worse. This paper argues that a significant contributing factor to this situation is policy implementation failure. A systematic review of the literature reveals that the failure to achieve the intended outcomes of environmental policies is due to economic, political and communication factors. Conflict between the objectives of environmental policies and those focused on economic development, a lack of incentives to implement environmental policies, and a failure to communicate objectives to key stakeholders are all key factors that contribute to the inability to attain environmental sustainability.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) has the potential to sustain soil productivity and benefit agroecosystems, yet it is not fully understood how yield responses of different cropping systems are affected by inherent soil characteristics, for example, texture and dynamic soil properties, such as aggregation, nutrients and erosion. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to compare crop yield from cropland with conventional management versus different CA practices, specifically reduced- or no-tillage, agroforestry, organic farming and cover crops. The data were first analysed for different climatic regions, soil textures and cash crop types. We then quantified how yield responses correlated with soil properties change under different CA practices. The results showed that CA practices were associated with an overall mean crop yield increase of 12%. This response was primarily driven by corn, which had a mean yield increase of almost 41% after CA implementation, whereas other cash crops did not have significant yield responses or showed slight decreases, as rotation with mixtures of multiple cash crops had a mean decrease of 6% when using CA. The increase in corn yield after CA may be related to the enhanced ability of that crop to absorb nutrient elements (e.g. nitrogen) and reduce nutrient leaching. Agroforestry increased crop yield by 66% and cover cropping increased yield by 11%, likely due to increases in soil water content and nutrient availability and decreases in erosion and surface runoff. However, other agricultural systems showed no significant increase after CA compared with conventional row cropping practices. Using CA practices had the greatest yield benefit in tropical climates and when farming in coarse-textured soils. In addition, legumes and grass-legume mixtures resulted in significant cash crop yield increases, possibly because legumes promoted the increase of soil nitrogen and depleted soil moisture less compared with other cover crops. The results provide new insight into how interactions between soil properties and CA practices affect crop yield and at the same time can help guide the development of practical, evidence-based guidelines for using conservation practices to improve yield in corn and other cash crops.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adductor canal block (ACB) has emerged as an effective analgesic regional technique for major knee surgeries in the last decade. Its motor-sparing properties make it particularly attractive for ambulatory knee surgery, but evidence supporting its use in ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery is conflicting. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the analgesic effects of ACB for ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgeries. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases for randomized controlled trials examining the analgesic effects of ACB compared to control or any other analgesic modality. Both minor arthroscopic and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries were considered. Rest and dynamic pain scores, opioid consumption, opioid-related adverse effects, time to first analgesic request, patient satisfaction, quadriceps strength, and block-related complications were evaluated. Data were pooled using random-effects modeling. RESULTS: Our search yielded 10 randomized controlled trials comparing ACB with placebo or femoral nerve block (FNB); these were subgrouped according to the type of knee surgery. For minor knee arthroscopic surgery, ACB provided reduced postoperative resting pain scores by a mean difference (95% confidence interval) of -1.46 cm (-2.03 to -0.90) (P < .00001), -0.51 cm (-0.92 to -0.10) (P = .02), and -0.48 cm (-0.93 to -0.04) (P = .03) at 0, 6, and 8 hours, respectively, compared to control. Dynamic pain scores were reduced by a mean difference (95% confidence interval) of -1.50 cm (-2.10 to -0.90) (P < .00001), -0.50 cm (-0.95 to -0.04) (P = .03), and -0.59 cm (-1.12 to -0.05) (P = .03) at 0, 6, and 8 hours, respectively, compared to control. ACB also reduced the cumulative 24-hour oral morphine equivalent consumption by -7.41 mg (-14.75 to -0.08) (P = .05) compared to control. For ACLR surgery, ACB did not provide any analgesic benefits and did not improve any of the examined outcomes, compared to control. ACB was also not different from FNB for these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: After minor ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery, ACB provides modest analgesic benefits, including improved relief for rest pain, and reduced opioid consumption for up to 8 and 24 hours, respectively. The analgesic benefits of ACB are not different from placebo or FNB after ambulatory ACLR, suggesting a limited role of both blocks in this procedure. Paucity of trials dictates cautious interpretation of these findings. Future studies are needed to determine the role of ACB in the setting of local anesthetic instillation and/or graft donor-site analgesia.

AB  - This article shows the first results existing of the legal framework for the management of Historical Centers as part of the territory, particularly of the Liberia situation as part of the project "Baseline for the sustainable management of the Historical Center of Liberia City". The project reviews a brief documentary analysis and a systematic review of the laws, regulations, and case law concerning the historical centers as a heritage property and the territory's resources from the municipal power perspective of establishing legal instruments for the management of the territory and urban planning.
   Following the Kelsen pyramid about the hierarchical regulatory system, there were selected executive laws, decrees, and rules, as well as related case law with a heritage property as part of the territory, for the present paper there were no considerations of the international conventions about heritage property since this was addressed comprehensively in other projects.
   The contribution of this article is to identify the regulatory framework that sustains the municipal regulation as the management tool for heritage conservation of the Historical Center.

AB  - It is now well-accepted that infrastructure development is essential for the growth of any economy. Successive governments in India, both at the Union and State level have given a thrust towards increased budgetary spending on infrastructure to help economic growth. On the eve of the 75th year of independence, there is a reiteration for long-term initiatives, including focused programs for roads, railways, airports, waterways, mass transport, ports, and logistics to further boost infrastructure spending. Keeping this in mind, the authors sought to systematically review the literature on how infrastructure development has unfolded in India between the years 2000-2022. The study shows that with diverse economic growth in India, there is interest in infrastructure development aligned with public interests. Infrastructure development is contextual and location-specific. Access to infrastructure positively impacts social and economic outcomes. There is however growing concern for sustainable development with rapid urbanization.

AB  - This paper aims to systematically review the existing literature to better understand multiple, complex facets of green consumption behaviour in the tourism sector and identify areas for future research. This review followed the PRISMA approach and analysed 92 studies published between 2009 and 2023 in high-impact journals. The present systematic review of scholarly studies on green consumption behaviour in tourism contributes to the existing literature, providing up-to-date research findings. Research has shown that studies on green consumption behaviour have predominantly centred on the accommodation industry. The Theory of Planned Behaviour has been widely utilised as a theoretical framework for such research. However, previous findings lack generalisability, and cross-cultural comparisons are insufficient. As a result, it is imperative to conduct additional research to create frameworks and models that can assist marketers in diverse cultural contexts. Additionally, expanding the scope of inquiry into green consumption behaviour within the tourism sector is crucial.

AB  - Recent scientific and technological advancements have transformed the knowledge frontiers, giving rise to the next wave of disruptive technologies with deep impacts on urban society. An Urban Digital Twin (UDT) is a technology with great potential to transform the management and planning of the infrastructures and systems of sustainable smart cities towards environmental sustainability. However, despite the recent increase of research on UDTs due to its widespread diffusion much more recently, there is a lack of studies examining the existing bottlenecks to its implementation. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic literature review on the key challenges and open issues pertaining to the implementation of an UDT. Results indicate 8 important categories of challenges related to (1) interoperability and semantics; (2) infrastructure, including storage, computation, network; (3) data acquisition and actuation; (4) data quality and harmonization; (5) modeling, simulation and decision-support; (6) data visualization and information display; (7) human and capital resources; and finally (8) governance, organizational and social issues. All topics are significantly raised in the literature, with most emphasis on issues pertaining to data and model semantics, missing data, data quality and modeling. The findings serve to inform practitioners about the bottlenecks delaying the implementation of UDTs.

AB  - Crop-raiding is a major source of conflict between people and wildlife globally, impacting local livelihoods and impeding conservation. Conflict mitigation strategies that target problematic wildlife behaviours such as crop-raiding are notoriously difficult to develop for large-bodied, cognitively complex species. Many crop-raiders are generalist feeders. In more ecologically specialised species crop-type selection is not random and evidence-based management requires a good understanding of species' ecology and crop feeding habits. Comprehensive species-wide studies of crop consumption by endangered wildlife are lacking but are important for managing human-wildlife conflict. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of crop feeding records by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), a ripe-fruit specialist. We assessed quantitatively patterns of crop selection in relation to species-specific feeding behaviour, agricultural exposure, and crop availability. Crop consumption by chimpanzees is widespread in tropical Africa. Chimpanzees were recorded to eat a considerable range of cultivars (51 plant parts from 36 species). Crop part selection reflected a species-typical preference for fruit. Crops widely distributed in chimpanzee range countries were eaten at more sites than sparsely distributed crops. We identified 'high' and 'low' conflict crops according to their attractiveness to chimpanzees, taking account of their importance as cash crops and/or staple foods to people. Most (86%) high conflict crops were fruits, compared to 13% of low conflict crops. Some widely farmed cash or staple crops were seldom or never eaten by chimpanzees. Information about which crops are most frequently consumed and which are ignored has enormous potential for aiding on-the-ground stakeholders (i.e. farmers, wildlife managers, and conservation and agricultural extension practitioners) develop sustainable wildlife management schemes for ecologically specialised and protected species in anthropogenic habitats. However, the economic and subsistence needs of local people, and the crop-raiding behaviour of sympatric wildlife, must be considered when assessing suitability of particular crops for conflict prevention and mitigation.

AB  - For decades urban renewal projects featuring biodiversity conservation have been held up as best practice around the world. There is an ongoing desire amongst design practitioners and end-users for outcomes that foster biodiversity. However, such outcomes continue to be limited to ad hoc initiatives by individual champions rather than being standard practice. Designers are increasingly asked to integrate nature and biodiversity considerations within design, but what does this mean? We explore the variety of roles for biodiversity that have been assumed in urban development processes over the last two decades, through a systematic review of academic literature. We found that biodiversity was given 'passive', through to 'incidental' and 'active' roles, traditional development practice focuses largely on passive approaches. Discussing the implications of the conscious or unconscious role 'assigned' to biodiversity, we contend that giving biodiversity an 'active' role within design is essential for enabling biodiversity inclusive cities. We propose that acknowledging the 'non-human' stakeholder role of biodiversity is a critical first step towards proactive choices that enable 'biodiversity inclusive design'. This will enable designers to expand user-centred design for a more nuanced understanding of both human and nonhuman needs. We present an emergent 'participatory ladder for non-humans', which encourages designers to elevate biodiversity to having an active stakeholder role, leading towards biodiversity inclusive design practice.

AB  - Existing knowledge about fires has been challenged by changes in forests and wildfire regimes. We carried out a systematic literature review involving both a global and a case study approach (Portugal) to investigate the configuration of the social dimensions of wildfires in academic literature. We advance two interlocking claims: (i) human dimensions of wildfires are often simplified into shallow indicators of anthropogenic activities lacking social and historical grounding, and (ii) fire knowledge of Indigenous peoples and/or other forest and fire users and professionals remains overlooked. These arguments were manifest from the global-scale review and were confirmed by the case study of Portugal. The individual perceptions, memories and cultural practices of forest and fire users and professionals and the historical co-developments of fires, people and forests have been missing from wildfire research. Including and highlighting those perspectives will both add to existing knowledge and inform policies related to fire management by making them socially meaningful.

AB  - This review article examines the possibility of providing a toolkit to prepare habitats for free-roaming cats (FRCs) in public spaces. The toolkit targets local communities, authorities, stakeholders, and advocates in the cities of the Global South, to raise awareness and improve the welfare of FRCs living in urban communities. This article explores a relatively new area in urban studies and veterinary science, and its connection to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric analysis, which illustrated how the literature on urban studies ignores the sustainability of public spaces as a living space for FRCs. This study contributes to our understanding of the current situation of FRCs from a theoretical perspective, in relation to the urban transformation of low-income and high-poverty countries. The article concludes with a four-pillar toolkit to help impoverished communities use public spaces as a resource, build sustainable habitats, and provide living spaces for FRCs.

AB  - The need to define and implement adaptation solutions has emerged since the early 1990s when the IPCC started assessing the changes, causes, potential impacts and responses to climate change. Yet, limited information exists on the context-specific effectiveness of local adaptation of agronomic practices. The Near East and North Africa (NENA) region is one of the world's regions with the lowest per capita natural resources availability and one of the most vulnerable to climate change. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to improve the development and implementation of adaptation plans and actions to cope with climate change. This research implements the systematic review (SR) methodology to assess the scientific literature in adopting climate change adaptation practices for agriculture at the farm level in the NENA region. Results highlight a significant knowledge gap in adaptation in the region and recommend intensifying targeted research and funding to cope with urgent regional climate risks to rural and agricultural livelihoods. Key policy insights: A limited number of studies assess the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation options for the agricultural sector in the NENA region, with a majority of these published in the last ten years. Adapting crop management techniques to climate risks generates a net improvement in Near East and North Africa yields. However, adaptation responses aiming to increase agrosystems resilience show context-specific effectiveness. Water management options, which benefit crop water use efficiency to different extents, present relatively high implementation costs. Integrated management options show the potential to achieve additional multidimensional benefits. Still, well-designed long-term experiments are required to evaluate these practices in the different farming systems under present and projected climate conditions. An urgent need is to promote adaptation research for the various farming systems in the NENA region and to estimate the cost of adaptation measures to guarantee farmer incomes and food security in the face of climate change.

AB  - The Mediterranean region is facing many challenges, some of which can be addressed by nature-based solutions such as urban forests and green space. However, at best, urban forest research from Mediterranean countries has been only briefly addressed in review papers up to date. This Scopus-based review paper provides first insights into the development of urban forest research in the Mediterranean in the 20-year period from 1996 to 2015. The purpose of the review was to a) analyse distribution of urban forest research in the Mediterranean and identify countries that are forerunners based on the number of publications, b) to analyse distribution of research themes across the Mediterranean and per country, and hence point to research gaps and needs. Researchers from Italy, Turkey and Spain were the most productive in the analysed period. Research is mainly concentrated in the North, while it is scarce to non-existent in South and Eastern Mediterranean countries (excluding Turkey and Greece). Papers dealing with pollution, human health and sociocultural values were the most frequent. Some countries exhibited research specialisation with regard to certain themes. For instance Italian researchers mostly focused on topics related to pollution and urban forest management, the majority of Spanish papers addressed urban forests in the context of human health, while sociocultural values were the main research theme for researchers from Turkey. Papers were analysed also based on research methods, approaches and study locations. Suggested future research includes analysis of the quality of knowledge related to urban forests in the Mediterranean as well as of collaboration between researchers, research institutions and countries.

AB  - Researchers and institutions continue to formulate governance mechanisms and guidelines for using mineral resources for socio-economic purposes. The movement of sustainable mineral resource development has received high attention recently. This research planned to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature and institutional guidelines to explore and create a code of international best mining guidelines (IBMC) focusing on sustainable mineral resources growth. The study also planned to explore and compare the mining and minerals governance mechanisms of Pakistan against IBMC. Moreover, this research also explores how the mineral resources governance mechanisms and best mining guidelines actually reflect at the local operational level in Pakistan. The research methods include conducting a systematic literature review of the existing literature and institutional guidelines to create IBMC exploring the mining and mineral sector governance mechanisms of Pakistan, including institutional, legal, policy, regulatory, and fiscal frameworks for comparing against IBMC; conducting interviews with key informants to explore how the current local mining practices reflect against the best mining guidelines. This research found that a stable political and economic environment and sound infra-structure facilities are the basic conditions for attracting investment in the mining and mineral industry. Using a systematic review, this research has created IBMC, which can be used as a standard for improving governance mechanisms, including the institutional, legal, policy, and fiscal frameworks focusing on sustainable mineral resource growth by developed nations. The findings explored various challenges as well that hinder sustainable mineral resource growth in Pakistan. Some of the challenges include lack of unilateral institutional and legal controls, technocratic policy formulation, dissuasive fiscal system, and taxations, lack of proper cadaster system, poor accountability and transparency, corruption and rent-seeking, illegal mining, environmental issues, health and safety issues of mine workers, inadequate training and development of mining workers, exclusion of local communities from decision-making processes. To address these challenges, this research advocates for reforming mineral governance mechanisms according to IBMC. The findings of the study may steer the mining industry toward responsible and sustainable growth in Pakistan and other mineral-rich developing nations.

AB  - Detailed, accurate, and reliable data regarding the occurrence of amphibian species in nature reserves (NRs) are important to facilitate effective conservation and management programs. We evaluated the current situation and research gaps in amphibian species inventories of NRs in mainland China by conducting a systematic review of papers on amphibian diversity research in NRs from 1956 to 2021. Generally, there was a gradual increase in amphibian survey intensity and standards, however, as some important parameters were lacking, such as species abundance and threats to amphibians. The standardization of amphibian surveys in NRs needs to urgently be strengthened and effectively implemented. We hope that highlighting these biases and gaps could provide actionable information for decision-makers and improve conservation practices affecting amphibians in China and other native fauna elsewhere.

AB  - Sulfur (S) fertilization recommendations for grain crops in Brazil were formerly established from studies on crops with a low yield potential grown on soils under conventional tillage (CT). However, the subsequent adoption of no-tillage (NT) altered S dynamics in the soil, making it necessary to carefully evaluate the applicability of these S fertilizer recommendations. In addition, the emergence of modem high-yield-potential genotypes, the successive application of concentrated low-sulfur fertilizers, and reduction in S atmospheric deposition have raised the likelihood of positive responses of crops to S fertilization. Available literature reports contrasting crop responses to S fertilization in Brazilian soils, ranging from substantial gains to slight yield losses depending on the particular crop, soil, and climate. The primary aim of this study was to examine available data for crop grain responses to S application in NT soils in order to ascertain whether existing recommendations established for Brazilian CT soils also hold for NT soils. A systematic review of data from 35 scientific publications spanning 58 crop harvests revealed a positive yield response to S fertilization in 31 % of the crop harvests, with an average yield increase of 16 %. Crops on soils with available SO42--S contents above the critical level (viz., 7.5 mg dm(-3)) exhibited no positive response to S fertilization in any crop harvest (n = 18). Dry edible bean and com were the most responsive crops, and canola and wheat, the least. For the trials with positive crop responses, a fertilizer rate of 26 kg ha(-1) S sufficed to obtain at least 95 % of the maximum possible yield. In general, the S fertilization recommendations previously established for CT soil proved effective with grain crops on NT soils as a result of the critical levels of soil available SO42--S and the fact that the recommended S rates are similar to those found in this study considering trials conducted under NT conditions only. However, existing recommendations could be improved by using additional criteria for soils with available SO42--S contents below the critical level since a positive response was observed in 22 % (n = 18) and 92 % (n = 12) of the crop harvests under a subtropical and a tropical climate, respectively. Our results suggest that S fertilization must be prioritized in NT soils with available SO42--S contents below 7.5 mg dm(-3) in the 0.00-0.20 m layer, especially in tropical climate zones. In addition, regional fertilizer recommendation guidelines should consider crop type and yield expectation in order to facilitate more sustainable S management and increased crop yields in Brazil.

AB  - This meta-review examines the journeys that previous reviewers of the field of sports tourism have take over the sports tourism research terrain. The contested nature of core concepts (terminology, categories and the nature of the phenomena), dominant research areas (event sports tourism, a trend from impacts to leveraging research, often poor quality behavioural research, destination marketing and media, and resident perceptions), and the extent to which research is underpinned by, or rooted in, various subjects and/or disciplines, are all discussed. Various futures envisaged by previous reviewers are identified; in particular: management futures, knowledge futures, futures of the nature of sports tourism, and critical and challenging futures. In conclusion, it is suggested that a clear indicator of the maturity of sports tourism as a field of study would be a 'comfortableness' with the existence of contested perspectives and ideas, and a reflexive appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of research in the field, particularly in response to external challenges and critiques.

AB  - Global economic growth and the problems generated by climate change will cause an increase in the occurrence and violence of socioecological conflicts in the coming decades. To understand these trends, it is important to determine the current state of the conflicts. In Mexico efforts have been made to analyze socioecological conflicts at the regional level. However, it is important to know the conceptual approach under which this has been addressed and what variables that reflect the complexity of its socio-ecological context have been considered. The objective of this article is to review the trends and information gaps in the regional analysis of socioecological conflicts in Mexico, using a systematic review of documentary information sources and geovisualizers. As a result, only 30.6% of the information sources feature a defined conceptual approach. The conflicts are characterized by the drivers and social or environmental impacts in all studies. On the other hand, information gaps include the elucidation of management alternatives (41.7%) and future scenarios (22.2%), the description (25%) and analysis of the implied ecosystem services (13.9%), a gender approach (16.7%), an analysis of the normative frame (8.3%), and the exogenous conditions associated with environmental patterns (38.9%) such as the influence of climate change. We argue that a regional analysis of conflicts using a socioecological approach integrating environmental and social components could allow a comparative analysis. It could also provide an understanding of the contextual variables and underlying causes of conflicts. This information is necessary for socioecological conflict management towards peaceful resolutions.

AB  - The delivery of electricity employing an electromagnetic field that extends across an intervening region is called a wireless power transfer (WPT). This approach paves the way for electric vehicles (EVs) to use newly available options to reduce their environmental impact. This article is a review that examines the WPT technology for use in electric vehicle applications from both the technical aspect and the environmental impact. This review will attempt to accomplish the following objectives: (1) describe the present state of the technology behind the development and application of a WPT across the transportation industry; (2) substantiate the actual implementation of WPT EV systems; and (3) estimate the functioning of the autonomous system, as well as detect the potential stumbling blocks and openings for enhancement. The most recent advancements and implementation in compensating topologies, power electronics converters, and control techniques are dissected and debated scientifically to improve the system's performance. To evaluate the performance from a sustainable perspective, energy, environmental, and economic factors are utilized, and at the same time, policy drivers and health and safety problems are researched.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is significantly transforming the traditional way of managing supply chains. However, Industry 4.0 tools can be expensive and not affordable and can be implemented in a variety of ways. Therefore, the benefits of implementing these tools should be clarified before investing in digitizing the Procurement process. The objective of the work is to present the dimensions (Competencies, Management, Partnerships, Processes, Systems/Technologies, and Sustainability) and the tools of Ind4.0 motivating the trends of evolution in the procurement area in the face of these changes in technologies and digital transformation. Despite the importance of this issue, few studies have attempted to address the effects of Ind4.0, technologies, and intelligent systems in procurement. To fill this gap, in the applications of Ind4.0 tools a conceptual model was developed to classify different value propositions provided by the different applications of Ind4.0 tools in the internal and external processes of the area. Finally, the results conclude that the six dimensions proposed in the conceptual model can provide a better understanding of the Procurement area, demonstrating the trends of the implementation of Ind4.0 tools related to different activities, presented by the literature authors.

AB  - Financial performance is an indicator of the financial stability and the health of a firm. It is a measure of how well a firm uses its assets to generate revenues, a firm's credibility, and its ability to pay off debts. To study the theoretical development, empirical examinations, and growing trend of financial performance research, this study reviewed the financial performance literature based on 875 journal articles sourced from the Web of Science, ACM, and Scopus databases from 2005 to 2019. To carry out the review, we applied Cite Space and Ucinet software for visualization and social network analysis, statistical analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and other research methods. We obtained a panoramic depiction of the posts, authors, journals, and keywords, and also reviewed financial performance using the field of knowledge maps. Accordingly, this study highlighted the recent and future research trends, and found that corporate social responsibility, and the green and sustainable corporate environment are potential research areas. These findings, through the combination of bibliometric methods and a systematic review, provide a better understanding of the development of corporate financial performance for both researchers and practitioners.

AB  - The rise of new tourism forms has dominated the last two decades matching a dramatically segmented market, thus answering to the minor of niches met in the new tourism era. Sport tourism has concentrated great theoretical attention since it manages to synthesise two major social leisure expressions that of sport and tourism. This tourism development suggested a vivid sustainable character emphasised in the vast majority of theoretical approaches. Still, sport tourism education failed to effectively incorporate sustainability as a core course module, focusing rather on traditional operational outlines, thus limiting the building of green conscious and applicable industry skills in the tourism management scene. The present analysis through a systematic review provides a range of approaches to assist in the difficult task of mapping a sustainable sports tourism outline, not only in terms of the course structure, but also in terms of the relationship between the course and its evolving tourism environment. The examination of existing theoretical paradigms aims to produce generalizable fields of academic education leading to well skilled sustainability-minded sport tourism professionals.

AB  - Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was undertaken to establish benefits of urban forests on reducing nutrient concentrations in adjacent or downstream waterbodies. Following screening, a small number of articles (40) were found relevant, representing studies quantifying non-point source nutrient losses from urban and peri-urban environments. Evidence was split between plot- and catchment-scale. Plot-scale studies often included evaluations of engineered nature-based solutions. At catchment-scale, studies of streamwater quality typically investigated influence of contributory catchment nutrient sources. Wide ranges of beneficial reductions were apparent, and at both scales not all studies identified significant benefits. Summarizing against this backdrop, at plot (micro-) scale woodland reduces mean concentrations in runoff, soil or groundwater by an average of 44.2% for total nitrogen (TN) and 47.0% for total phosphorus (TP). At catchment (meso-) scale, evidence suggests a 20% areal addition of forest at the expense of mixed urban fabric can reduce mean concentrations by 15.7% and 12.6% for TN and TP respectively. Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts. Canopy cover suppresses stream channel biological nitrogen uptake, which based on all evidence appears considerable. However, unshaded headwaters can foster accelerated primary productivity with undesirable downstream consequences. Overall, gathering further evidence is encouraged, given current uncertainties, especially to address differences between impervious, permeable and riparian urban woodland settings.

AB  - Management of mangrove ecosystems is complex, given that mangroves are both terrestrial and marine, often cross regional or national boundaries, and are valued by local stakeholders in different ways than they are valued on national and international scales. Thus, mangrove governance has had varying levels of success, analyzed through concepts such as principles of good governance and procedural justice in decision-making. Although there is substantial research on case studies of mangrove management, global comparisons of mangrove governance are lacking. This research aims to fill this gap by comparing relationships among qualities of governance across mangrove social-ecological systems worldwide. Through a systematic literature search and screening process, we identified 65 articles that discussed mangrove governance and conservation. Case studies in these articles, drawn from 39 countries, were categorized as top-down, bottom-up, or comanaged and thematically coded to assess the influence of eight principles of good governance in mangrove conservation success. Across all three governance systems, the principles of legitimacy, fairness, and integration were most important in determining conservation success or failure. These principles are closely related to the concept of procedural justice, highlighting the importance of stakeholder inclusion throughout all stages of mangrove management. Thus, we recommend clearly defined roles for all governance actors, transparent communication of policy development to stakeholders, fairness in both process and outcome, and careful consideration of sustainable access to conservation resources.

Therefore, the need for qualitative and longitudinal studies and the use of methods such as ethnography or historical analysis are understood well in this respect. The current study had a holistic approach to SC, and thus simultaneously covered the relevant areas and provided an appropriate strategy for identifying the missing circles in the SC field using the meta-study and scientometric instruments. In general, the present study identified the research gaps in this field, and other studies can use them as a guideline in order to choose future research areas.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has mainstreamed as an interdisciplinary framework in the urban sustainability and resilience agenda. While the uptake of ES in urban areas is deeply entangled with multiple values, trade-offs, institutions, management and planning approaches, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and systematic framework to address environmental justice (EJ) in urban ES assessments. This article presents a systematic literature review to examine what factors are critical for the effective inclusion of an EJ lens in urban ES appraisals. More specifically, we assessed how distributional, procedural and recognitional EJ dimensions have been addressed, and in relation to which types of urban ES. Our results reveal that EJ considerations are currently focused on the (un)equal distribution of ES and the associated green and blue infrastructure with regard to socioeconomic groups, with special attention to income and race/ethnicity as the main mechanisms of social stratification. There is also a predominant focus on regulating and cultural ES, analyzing their role on resilience and adaptive capacity on one hand, and recreational values, social cohesion and place-making on the other. In this review, we also evaluate the interconnected dimensions of justice and their constraints, and lay out pathways for new research into intersectional and restorative approaches to justice in ES assessments. Finally, we interrogate what the role of urban ES-based planning might be in making more inclusive and just cities and explore its implications for policy and practice.

AB  - Climate change represents a planetary emergency that is exacerbating the loss of native biodiversity. In response, efforts promoting climate change adaptation strategies that improve ecosystem resilience and/or mitigate climate impacts are paramount. Invasive Alien Species are a key threat to islands globally, where strategies such as preventing establishment (biosecurity), and eradication, especially invasive mammals, have proven effective for reducing native biodiversity loss and can also advance ecosystem resilience and create refugia for native species at risk from climate change. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that successful eradications may also contribute to mitigating climate change. Given the cross-sector potential for eradications to reduce climate impacts alongside native biodiversity conservation, we sought to understand when conservation managers and funders explicitly sought to use or fund the eradication of invasive mammals from islands to achieve positive climate outcomes. To provide context, we first summarized available literature of the synergistic relationship between invasive species and climate change, including case studies where invasive mammal eradications served to meet climate adaptation or mitigation solutions. Second, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and eradication-related conference proceedings to identify when these synergistic effects of climate and invasive species were explicitly addressed through eradication practices. Third, we reviewed projects from four large funding entities known to support climate change solutions and/or native biodiversity conservation efforts and identified when eradications were funded in a climate change context. The combined results of our case study summary paired with systematic reviews found that, although eradicating invasive mammals from islands is an effective climate adaptation strategy, island eradications are poorly represented within the climate change adaptation and mitigation funding framework. We believe this is a lost opportunity and encourage eradication practitioners and funders of climate change adaptation to leverage this extremely effective nature-based tool into positive conservation and climate resilience solutions.

AB  - While the state of the art of clinical assessment and imaging techniques were described in Part 1, this contribution presents a systematic review of the surgical treatment principles in the management of midface and internal orbit fractures from initial care to definitive treatment, including illustrative case examples. New developments and advances are characterized by limited versus extended surgical approaches, by standardization of osteosynthesis principles with regard to three-dimensional buttress reconstruction, by newly developed individualized implants such as titanium meshes and, especially for complex fracture patterns, by critical assessment of anatomical reconstruction through intraoperative endoscopy, as well as intraoperative and postoperative imaging. Newly developed resorbable soft tissue anchors can be used both for ligament and soft tissue resuspension in order to reduce ptosis effects in the cheeks and nasolabial area to achieve facial aesthetics similar to those prior to the injury.

AB  - Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute the leading cause of mortality globally. Low and middle-income countries (LMICs) not only experience the largest burden of humanitarian emergencies but are also disproportionately affected by NCDs, yet primary focus on the topic is lagging. We conducted a systematic review on the effect of humanitarian disasters on NCDs in LMICs assessing epidemiology, interventions, and treatment. Methods A systematic search in MEDLINE, MEDLINE (PubMed, for in-process and non-indexed citations), Social Science Citation Index, and Global Health (EBSCO) for indexed articles published before December 11, 2017 was conducted, and publications reporting on NCDs and humanitarian emergencies in LMICs were included. We extracted and synthesized results using a thematic analysis approach and present the results by disease type. The study is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42018088769). Results Of the 85 included publications, most reported on observational research studies and almost half (48.9%) reported on studies in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), with scant studies reporting on the African and Americas regions. NCDs represented a significant burden for populations affected by humanitarian crises in our findings, despite a dearth of data from particular regions and disease categories. The majority of studies included in our review presented epidemiologic evidence for the burden of disease, while few studies addressed clinical management or intervention delivery. Commonly cited barriers to healthcare access in all phases of disaster and major disease diagnoses studied included: low levels of education, financial difficulties, displacement, illiteracy, lack of access to medications, affordability of treatment and monitoring devices, and centralized healthcare infrastructure for NCDs. Screening and prevention for NCDs in disaster-prone settings was supported. Refugee status was independently identified both as a risk factor for diagnosis with an NCD and conferring worse morbidity. Conclusions An increased focus on the effects of, and mitigating factors for, NCDs occurring in disaster-afflicted LMICs is needed. While the majority of studies included in our review presented epidemiologic evidence for the burden of disease, research is needed to address contributing factors, interventions, and means of managing disease during humanitarian emergencies in LMICs.

AB  - Though studies in construction robotics and human-robot teams research have explored varying themes, an in-depth study of the state-of-the-art of methodological paradigms appropriate for construction robotics research is hitherto lacking, taking into consideration that several studies have highlighted conflicting methodological components such as research design, methods, data sources, data types and analytical techniques. To better understand this underexplored area, this study uses a four-stage review approach utilising a scientometric and systematic analysis method based on 112 articles. Using statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between research components, the study reveals strong associations between components of research methods, data sources and analytical techniques. Researchers are also increasingly looking to mixed paradigms in data sources and designs, highlighting a methodological plurality in construction robotics research. Implications on what this means for the future of construction robotics, policy and stakeholders are discussed in the study.

AB  - The genetically and geographically isolated Cook Inlet beluga whale (CIB) was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2008 and a federal recovery plan was adopted in 2016. Despite these measures, the population has failed to make demonstrable progress toward recovery. Data and knowledge gaps exist, as well as high uncertainty in the recovery plan, regarding the impact and severity of identified threats on CIB health and recovery, particularly for threats driven by anthropogenic factors, and cumulative effects. These data deficiencies may hinder threat prioritization and conservation and management actions. Odontocete populations in similarly ecologically precarious situations may serve as research surrogates to help fill information gaps and guide future CIB research and conservation. Through a systematic review of CIB and selected surrogate species [St. Lawrence beluga (SLB), Hector's dolphins (HD), and southern resident killer whales (SRKW)], we identify gaps associated with threats described and ranked in the CIB recovery plan. All threats identified by the National Marine Fisheries Services as "high "-concern to CIB recovery, except noise, are lower in publication volume compared to publications related to high concern threats in SLB and SRKW. "Medium " or "low " threats to CIB, such as prey reduction and contaminants, respectively, are identified as higher priority threats in surrogate populations. These topics have been more heavily researched for surrogates and suggests that synthesis of this work may help reduce uncertainty, to aid in informing management actions for CIB. Specifically, publishing volume suggests SLB and SRKW are valuable surrogates for understanding the impacts of noise, prey, and contaminants. Publishing volume is necessary to choose a surrogate, but is not sufficient. Surrogates were chosen based on physiological similarities to CIB as well as their comparable management situations. Therefore, these lower-ranked threats should be ranked more highly and researched specifically in regard to CIB. We use this review to offer management recommendations based on current CIB and surrogate literature regarding listed threats in the CIB recovery plan. Our analyses suggest that CIB may benefit from a revision to and elevation of some low and medium-concern threats such as contaminants, habitat degradation, and prey reduction.

AB  - Managers and practitioners have increasingly applied participative multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in marine multi-objective management situations. Despite methodological advances and practical experiences, there is no systematic review that clarifies the current scope and challenges of participatory MCDA in fisheries management, aquaculture and marine conservation. Using the IS! Web of Science database, 95 peer-reviewed publications were found that report MCDA applications in marine management (fisheries or aquaculture) and marine conservation. Of these, 31 studies explicitly and systematically incorporate stakeholders' engagement at one or more stages of the MCDA process. Results show how participative MCDA has been applied in a wide range of marine multi-objective problems. Interestingly, 76% of studies included participation and 24% consultation processes. Most MCDA studies in marine environments were developed in Europe and Asia. Results highlight that despite successful experiences in participative MCDA, participation has been generally fragmented. Participatory processes have focused mainly at particular stages, such as the establishment of objectives and criteria, and elicitation of weights of importance. Conversely, other important stages of MCDA, such as identifying alternatives, estimating consequences or prioritizing management alternatives, exhibited low levels of participation and/or consultation. In addition, results suggest that uncertainties around multiple values judgments are seldom treated in marine MCDA studies. Greater rigor in promoting an active participation in the complete decision process and fully considering the uncertainties around people's value judgments are important research gaps, which if addressed, could substantially improve participative MCDA applications aimed at achieving sustainable management and conservation.

AB  - The Neotropical region has the greatest taxonomic and functional diversity of fish in the world. However, this biodiversity has been threatened by the introduction of non-native species. Therefore, we present a systematic review of the literature concerning the introduction of non-native fish species in Neotropical freshwaters. We examine the origins of non-native fish species, as well as the invaded ecoregions and introduction vectors. Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo trutta, Cichla kelberi, and Oreochromis niloticus were the most frequent introduced fish species and rivers and reservoirs were the most studied freshwater ecosystems. Impoundments, aquarium trade, sport fishing, and aquaculture were recorded as the main vectors for the introduction of non-native fish species. Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil. The Upper Parana ecoregion exhibited the largest number of non-native fish species, of which the majority originated from the Lower Parana ecoregion. We noticed that the origins of non-native fish species are linked to their introduction vectors, as several non-native fish species arrive from areas near to where they are introduced, mainly by impoundment and sport fishing. On the other hand, species from regions outside the Neotropics are especially introduced by aquarium trade and aquaculture.

AB  - Many tropical mountain ecosystems (TME) are severely disturbed, requiring ecological restoration to recover biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, the extent of restoration efforts across TMEs is not known due to the lack of syntheses on ecological restoration research. Here, based on a systematic review, we identify geographical and thematic research gaps, compare restoration interventions, and consolidate enabling factors and barriers of restoration success. We find that restoration research outside Latin-America, in non-forested ecosystems, and on socio-ecological questions is scarce. For most restoration interventions success is mixed and generally limited by dispersal and microhabitat conditions. Finally, we propose five directions for future research on tropical mountain restoration in the UN decade of restoration, ranging from scaling up restoration across mountain ranges, investigating restoration in mountain grasslands, to incorporating socio-economic and technological dimensions.

AB  - This article presents a review about violence against the elderly, covering the period of 2000 to 2009. The database used in this research was the collection of articles, books, book chapters, manuals and plans of action of the Virtual Library on Violence and Health. We analyzed 115 documents divided into the following categories: falls; external causes and violence in general; epidemiological and socio-epidemiological studies; prevention of violence; violence and accidents in the family; conceptual and methodological review; legal order and denunciation; violence from the elderly's point of view; health services, professionals and caretakers; and construction and validation of research instruments. The results show a relevant increase in production and methodological improvement in public health, social work, law, physiotherapy, nursing, psychology and otorhinolaryngology. However, there are issues that have not been sufficiently approached such as traffic accidents, homicides, suicides, drowning and suffocation.

AB  - The paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based regional and urban heat island (RHI and UHI) studies in cities and their challenges, from 2010 to the present based on visualizing scientific landscapes (VOS) viewer analysis and Scopus and science database search using a set of standard criteria. The review results show that 52.17% of the studies used Landsat images followed by MODIS (36.65%). Based on VOS viewer analysis author keywords, remote sensing was strongly linked to urban heat island, urban greenspace, and improvise surface, respectively. Regarding, Co-authorship network China, Canada and the United kingdom's authors actively collaborated with different world researchers. The most frequently studied regions and periods of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. A total of 55% of the articles reported the use of a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from sensors. On the other hand, remotely sensed UHI studies have been facing a series of challenges, including differences between remote sensing satellite-derived LST and air temperature, impacts of clouds and other factors on LST data, methods to quantify UHI, accuracy assessment and attribution of RHI and UHI. Thus, consideration was given to the understudied cities, the methods to compute RHI and/or UHI intensity, inter-annual variability and modeling in the future.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is believed to have a significant potential use in tackling climate change. This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate.

AB  - Challenges in managing electronic waste (E-waste) arise from a lack of technical skills, poor infrastructure, inadequate financial support, and inactive community engagement. This study provides a systematic review of efforts to overcome these challenges in the context of inappropriate recycling protocols of Ewaste and their toxic effects on human health and the environment. An inventory of end-of-life electronic products, which can be established through the creation of an environment friendly regulatory regime for recycling, is essential for the proper control of E-waste. An approach has been articulated to help implement effective management of E-waste in both developed and developing countries. Enforcement of systematic management measures for E-waste in developing countries coupled with best practices is expected to minimize adverse impacts while helping maintain a sustainable and resilient environment.

AB  - The UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) aims at regular and standardised stocktaking of the extent of ecosystems, their condition, and the services they provide to society. Recording the condition of ecosystems is one of the most complex pieces in this exercise and needs to be supported by consistent guidelines. SEEA EA defines the condition of an ecosystem as its overall quality, measured in terms of quantitative metrics describing its abiotic and biotic characteristics. One of the key challenges lies in identifying the most appropriate metrics for each ecosystem type that capture these essential characteristics. The objective of this paper is to create a well-defined framework for transparent and operative development of ecosystem condition indicators, which can be used in ecosystem accounting and ecosystem assessment studies. Starting from the SEEA EA documentation and a small targeted systematic review, we identified 12 key criteria, which we grouped according to their roles during the indicator development process. Five conceptual criteria (intrinsic relevance, instrumental relevance, sensitivity, directional meaning, and framework conformity) outline the priorities for identifying relevant characteristics of the ecosystems. Five practical criteria (validity, reliability, availability, simplicity, and compatibility) provide guidance on identifying concrete quantitative metrics for the selected characteristics. Finally, two ensemble criteria (comprehensiveness, and parsimony) ensure the completeness and complementarity of the final set of metrics. To tackle the climate and biodiversity crises, the condition of ecosystems needs to be better recognized in national economic planning. The proposed framework supports the selection of a concise set of salient and credible ecosystem condition indicators through a transparent, repeatable and scientific process. This can make the compilation of ecosystem condition accounts more accessible and more standardised on a global level, which is a key prerequisite for the success of SEEA EA. Additionally, the framework presented in this paper may be useful in other contexts where ecological, environmental, or sustainability indicators need to be identified.

AB  - Growing inequity in access to sustainable irrigation supply services, groundwater and electricity in particular, has become core agendas in many recent global development dialogues on account of food/nutritional security, ensuring on-farm livelihood opportunities, rural poverty alleviation and development. Herein, we aim to present a nation-wide appraisal of eco-environmental and socioeconomic ramifications of subsidizing farm-power services in India, to highlight future requirements to conserve groundwater reserves so as to ensure sustainable irrigation supply services. We adopted a mixed method approach, coupling secondary data analysis (obtained from various governmental archives), with a systematic review of relevant global literature. For the latter, we adopted a multi-stage PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) to summarize observations from post-2000 literature. Our results indicate that, over the years, groundwater has emerged as the mainstay of the irrigation sector in India (via millions of tube/bore wells), replacing surface-water systems (canals). However, unsustainable groundwater drafting has led to (i) significant groundwater drawdowns in most Indian states; (ii) exacerbated greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) caused extensive soil-water salinization, which impede sustainable agrarian/rural development on long-run. Current literature, however, suggests that, unsustainable groundwater drafting is indulged at policy level only by (i) relaxed groundwater tariffing scheme, and (ii) lucrative agro-power subsidies - collectively which offer the farmers free reign to draft groundwater at will. We reflect on the rise of groundwater market, leading to disproportionate access to groundwater for irrigation, and tragedy of the less-endowed sections of the famring communities. We urge the concerned authorities to devise and implement strategic institutional reforms to bolster the agro-power subsidy delivery mechanisms, and reflect on opportunities of nationwide adoption of feeder channel segregation (FCS) and initiate minimum energy support (MES) schemes. The idea is to make the agro-energy sector more efficient (based on notions of equity, fairness and transparency for all to access the benefits. In the final section we urge the authorities to adopt a systems' thinking approach to identify the key barriers to on- ground implementation of FCS and MES; introduce smart metering system, and above all, incorporate the water-food-energy nexus application in mainstream decision making for irrigation services. The idea is to identify/develop means of resource co-management, identify synergies and trade-off, within a unified framework of irrigation systems' governance that balances resources supply and demand, without endangering the ecosystem services. We also outline potential research directions; emphasize on need of targeted, process-level investigations with increased case studies, and urge the authorities for improved data dissemination and accessibility.

AB  - This paper will present a systematic review of the main publications for landscape and tourism research in Scopus and polish language databases. These were used to identify papers on landscape and tourism published from January 2003 to September 2013. A total of 382 articles and 37 other sources were identified, but 116 analysed. The analysis, focusing on the explicated relation between landscape and tourism, shows that it is a new but growing concern for geographers, ecologists, and landscape architects contributing to the debate. The result is a veritable smorgasbord of definitions and approaches. The objective of this paper is to systematise the current knowledge on tourism and landscape, review the existing definitions of the term >> tourist landscape <<, and determine its aspects and components in the context of functions of regions. The paper concludes with a tentative definition of a tourist landscape and proposals for further scholarly research and some policy advice.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are increasingly providing decision making and operational support across multiple domains. AI includes a wide (and growing) library of algorithms that could be applied for different problems. One important notion for the adoption of AI algorithms into operational decision processes is the concept of assurance. The literature on assurance, unfortunately, conceals its outcomes within a tangled landscape of conflicting approaches, driven by contradicting motivations, assumptions, and intuitions. Accordingly, albeit a rising and novel area, this manuscript provides a systematic review of research works that are relevant to AI assurance, between years 1985 and 2021, and aims to provide a structured alternative to the landscape. A new AI assurance definition is adopted and presented, and assurance methods are contrasted and tabulated. Additionally, a ten-metric scoring system is developed and introduced to evaluate and compare existing methods. Lastly, in this manuscript, we provide foundational insights, discussions, future directions, a roadmap, and applicable recommendations for the development and deployment of AI assurance.

KW  - EXPLANATION
AB  - Background. Although there is a large literature examining the relationship between a wide range of political economy exposures and health outcomes, the extent to which the different aspects of political economy influence health, and through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is only partially understood. The areas in which there are few high-quality studies are also unclear.
   Objectives. To systematically review the literature describing the impact of political economy on population health.
   Search Methods. We undertook a systematic review of reviews, searching MEDLINE, Embase, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, ProQuest Public Health, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, EconLit, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the gray literature via Google Scholar.
   Selection Criteria. We included studies that were a review of the literature. Relevant exposures were differences or changes in policy, law, or rules; economic conditions; institutions or social structures; or politics, power, or conflict. Relevant outcomes were any overall measure of population health such as self-assessed health, mortality, life expectancy, survival, morbidity, well-being, illness, ill health, and life span. Two authors independently reviewed all citations for relevance.
   Data Collection and Analysis. We undertook critical appraisal of all included reviews by using modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria and then synthesized narratively giving greater weight to the higher-quality reviews.
   Main Results. From 4912 citations, we included 58 reviews. Both the quality of the reviews and the underlying studies within the reviews were variable. Social democratic welfare states, higher public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, improved access to health care, and high-quality affordable housing have positive impacts on population health. Neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower self-rated health and higher mortality.
   Authors' Conclusions. Politics, economics, and public policy are important determinants of population health. Countries with social democratic regimes, higher public spending, and lower income inequalities have populations with better health. There are substantial gaps in the synthesized evidence on the relationship between political economy and health, and there is a need for higher-quality reviews and empirical studies in this area. However, there is sufficient evidence in this review, if applied through policy and practice, to have marked beneficial health impacts.
   Public Health Implications. Policymakers should be aware that social democratic welfare state types, countries that spend more on public services, and countries with lower income inequalities have better self-rated health and lower mortality. Research funders and researchers should be aware that there remain substantial gaps in the available evidence base. One such area concerns the interrelationship between governance, polities, power, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and population health, including how these aspects of political economy generate social class processes and forms of discrimination that have a differential impact across social groups. This includes the influence of patterns of ownership (of land and capital) and tax policies. For some areas, there are many lower-quality reviews, which leave uncertainties in the relationship between political economy and population health, and a high-quality review is needed. There are also areas in which the available reviews have identified primary research gaps such as the impact of changes to housing policy, availability, and tenure.

AB  - This paper argues that enhancing the water conservation behavior of the urban population would provide an alternative solution by demand curtailment and behavior change, rather than traditional methods of increasing water supply. A structured, evidence-based approach to identify relevant research studies has been instrumental in this research. The paper provides a systematic review of 35 papers, narrowed down from 3089 papers, which have converged towards an integrated approach to water conservation behavior. The significant factors of water conservation behavior were classified under four broad themes: psychological, situational, demographic, and contextual. The review showed that the situational and contextual variables were understudied among these factors. Further, this study identifies research gaps in the models of water conservation behavior and highlights the need for future work. The issue of sustainability of water through a cogent argument based upon behavioral studies in water conservation has been carried out.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the quality of integrated reports (IR) and highlight the gaps in the existing research to provide directions and suggestions for future research.Design/methodology/approachThis study was conducted through a systematic literature review using content analysis based on 40 papers from the Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCOhost databases on IR quality. While reading the full-text papers, the authors found six additional papers referenced by the literature being reviewed that were relevant to IR quality. Thus, there were 46 papers in the final review. The analysis begins with the definition and dimension of IR quality and theoretical lenses. Furthermore, this study outlines constructs or variables used in the previous literature.FindingsThe authors found that most studies used the quantitative method (41 papers or 89%). Five papers in the literature used qualitative methods (11%). Most researchers (34 papers or 72%) defined IR quality as consistent with the International Integrated Reporting Council framework, specifically the eight content elements. In particular, with the constructs that make up the quality of the IR, variations between researchers were found. Furthermore, there were some gaps that could be the directions for future research.Research limitations/implicationsThe literature that provides academic knowledge about IR quality is still limited, and research on IR is still growing. The literature review conducted by this study can provide an overview of the current research positions on the quality of IR and directions for future research in this area.Practical implicationsThis study intends to show corporate executives a framework demonstrating the quality of corporate reporting. It can impact not only investors as a specific stakeholder group but also other stakeholder groups.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first literature review to examine the quality of IR, thus providing a map of current research to suggest directions for future research. Most of the previous literature reviews have been focused on integrated reporting (IR) in general and not quality.

AB  - Soil health is defined as the capacity of soil to function, within ecosystem boundaries, to sustain crop and animal productivities, maintain or enhance environmental sustainability, and improve human health worldwide. In agro-ecosystems, the soil health can change due to anthropogenic activities, such as preferred cropping practices and intensive land-use management, which can further impact soil functions. Previous assessment of soil health in agriculture mostly relates to soil eco-functions that are integrated with nonbiological properties such as soil nutrients and soil structures. In recent years, biological properties such as soil microorganisms were considered as an essential composition in soil health as well. However, systematic reviews of soil health and its potential feedback to human society under different cropping practices are still limited. In this review, we discussed 1) the impact of common and novel cropping practices in agro-systems on soil health, 2) the evolution of plant-microbe-soil complex and the biochemical mechanisms under the pressure of agriculture that responsible for soil health, 3) changes in the concept of soil quality and health over recent decades in agro-systems and the key indicators currently used for evaluating soil health, and 4) issues in agroecosystems that affect soil health the most, particularly how various cropping practices have developed over time with human activities in agroecosystem. This knowledge, along with necessary policies, will help to ensure healthy soil-a crucial component for sustainable ecosystem development. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical inland capture fisheries are susceptible to a series of vulnerabilities such as habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, pollution, overfishing, invasive species and anthropogenic climate change. A comprehensive review of the impact of climatic uncertainties on Indian inland fisheries has not been adequately attempted yet. Recent approaches emphasizing ecosystem based management in a regional context, specific to inland fisheries for combating climatic changes, have not been reported to date. The paper presents a critical bibliometric review of the climatic vulnerabilities faced by Indian inland fishery resources and various adaptive and mitigation strategies put forward by the country for the sustainability of the resources. In this communication, a systematic review of the impact of climate change and other stressors on various inland ecosystems of the subcontinent and the ecosystem-based management strategies adopted in India is presented and discussed.

AB  - We performed a systematic literature review on the use of free geospatial services as potential tools to assess built environmental characteristics related W dietary behaviour and physical activity. We included 13 studies, all published since 2010 and conducted in urban contexts, with Google Earth and Google Street View as the two main free geospatial services used. The agreement between virtual and field audit was higher for items related to objectively verifiable measures (e.g. presence of infrastructure and equipment) and lower for subjectively assessed items (e.g. aesthetics, street atmosphere, etc.). Free geospatial services appear as promising alternatives to field audit for assessment of objective dimensions of the built environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the increasing investment in sustainable development over the past decade, a systematic review of sustainable construction project financing is lacking. The objectives of this paper are to conduct a systematic review to examine the policies, practices, and research efforts in the area of sustainable construction project financing, and to explore the potential opportunities for the future research. To achieve these goals, this paper first reviewed the sustainable construction project financing practices implemented by four representative developed economies including the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, and Australia. Then, this paper reviewed the efforts and initiatives launched by three international organizations including the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and International Finance Corporation. After that, this paper reviewed the research efforts of sustainable construction project financing published in peer-review journals and books. This paper identified four major research themes within this area, which are the review of financial stakeholders and market of sustainable construction, benefits and barriers to sustainable construction project financing, financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects, innovative models and mechanisms for sustainable construction project financing. Additionally, this paper revealed five directions for the future research of sustainable construction project financing, which are the identification of financial issues in sustainable construction projects, the investigation of financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects in terms of their strengths, limitations, and performances, the examination of critical drivers for implementing sustainable construction project financing, the development of a knowledge-based decision support system for implementing sustainable construction financing, and the development of best practices for implementing sustainable construction project financing. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by reviewing existing policies, practices, and research efforts in the area of sustainable construction project financing. Meanwhile, the findings from this paper benefit the industry as well, because they are able to provide the practitioners with a holistic view of sustainable construction project financing, thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills in this regard.

AB  - IntroductionSexualized drug use (SDU), the use of psychoactive drugs in the context of sexual intercourse, has been identified as a risk factor for HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Asia. Given the distinct social and cultural context of same-sex relationships and drug-using practice in Asia, we aimed to describe the prevalence of SDU in East and South Asian countries and its associations with condomless anal sex (CAI) and HIV status. Synthesizing SDU research in this region, including SDU definitions, prevalence and outcomes, provides insights to inform future research and improved programme planning, resourcing and advocacy. MethodsWe systematically searched OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, OVID Global Health, CINAHL, PsycINFO and SCOPUS publication databases for scientific articles published from 1990 to 2022 measuring SDU among MSM in East and South Asian countries. A narrative synthesis was utilized to describe key study attributes and findings, and meta-analyses using random pooled effect models were used to estimate SDU prevalence and its associations with CAI and HIV status. Subgroup meta-analyses, sensitivity analysis and assessment of publication bias examined potential sources of heterogeneity for the pooled SDU prevalence estimates. Results and discussionOf the 1788 publications screened, 49 publications met the selection criteria and 18 were suitable for meta-analyses. Findings highlight SDU definitions distinct from other regions but inconsistencies in the definition of SDU between studies that have been highlighted in research elsewhere. The pooled prevalence of recent SDU (past 12 months) was 13% (95% CI = 10-16%; I-2 = 97.6) but higher when studies utilized self-administered surveys (15%; 95% CI = 12-19%; p<0.05). SDU was associated with greater odds of CAI (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.82-5.66) and living with diagnosed HIV (OR = 4.73; 95% CI = 2.27-8.21). ConclusionsSDU is common among MSM in East and South Asian countries, but varying SDU definitions limit between-study comparisons. Responses to SDU-related harms should consider local contexts, including specific drug types used and their relative risks.

AB  - Natural disasters, economic and environmental crises, and pandemic diseases have highlighted the need to revise urban development models to anticipate new development strategies. Cities have been historically associated with production, trade, and consumption processes. However, the role of production has been eliminated in the contemporary world, and trade and consumption have dominated this cycle. This is one of the issues that has been fueling urban crises. Therefore, it is necessary to create an urban resilience matrix by integrating productivity and urban landscape as a planning tool and also the development of sustainable infrastructure. Given that continuous productive urban landscape (CPUL) is a novel concept in the theoretical field of urban landscape, this systematic review was conducted based on a four-stage model by formulating the study searching strategy using the following keywords: productive landscape, urban landscape, integrated productive urban landscape, dynamic landscape, and productive urban landscape in top citation databases. In the initial search, 377 papers published from 2000 to 2021 were found, 56 of which were selected as qualified papers for in-depth analysis and finding answers to research questions. Then, the screened papers were analyzed in terms of content and synthesis. The existing views and definitions were extracted and classified chronologically to redefine the concept of integrated productive urban landscapes by examining and comparing the definitions. Based on the analysis and classification of definitions, the integrated productive urban landscape strategy is a network of green and open multi-purpose structures. These structures connect the landscape and social centers through productive spaces, with the priority of walking while passing through the built environments. An integrated productive urban landscape, as a new typology of the landscape, considers the landscape as an integrated structure from a holistic and ecological perspective and integrates urban agriculture in green and open public spaces. It defines a new layer of the landscape in cities in addition to redefining open urban spaces. Also, this strategy proposes a new way of life and production-based spatial organization that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable by emphasizing local production as a forgotten opportunity. Implementing the integrated productive urban landscape strategy based on the identified structural and functional features can create an interaction between social, economic, and environmental environments. Moreover, this is considered a consistent and flexible strategy that contributes to the urban development and resilience of the urban ecosystem by providing a model for land use management and planning. Therefore, this approach provides an appropriate response to the challenges of contemporary urban development.

AB  - Push-pull technology (PPT) employs mixed cropping for sustainable intensification: an intercrop repels or suppresses pests of the focal crop (push), while a trap crop attracts pests out of the field (pull), where they may be targeted for control. Underlying chemical-ecological mechanisms have been demonstrated in controlled settings, primarily for some of the best-established cereal PPT systems developed in east Africa. Yet, many questions remain regarding mechanisms, and strategies to adapt PPT for different crops and locations. We con-ducted a systematic review of scientific literature on PPT and related practices for biological control of pests of food and fodder. Of 3335 results, we identified 45 reporting on chemistry of trap-or intercropping systems for pest control, of which 30 focused on cereals or African pests. Seven of these reported primary chemical data: measurements from glasshouse and laboratory studies (5), or of field-collected samples (2). From these 30, we provide a database of compounds, discussing degrees of evidence for their mediation of push-pull. We depict hypothesized spatial distributions of selected compounds in PPT fields from physical properties and emission/ exudation rates, and design of the east African cereal PPT system, and discuss influences on activity in field settings likely to affect success.

AB  - Rapid development of the population has brought about a serious problem of waste generation and management. Open dumping and land filling are two of the preferred options for waste management and treatment. As a consequence of this, the accumulation of leachates has become one of the concerns for environmental sustainability. In this regard, various treatment methodologies have been developed in recent decades. Among them, the nanomaterial-based approaches are the emerging ones in the current scenario due to their various unique properties. Furthermore, nanomaterial-based assemblies (i.e., nanomaterials combined with microbes, chemical catalysts, enzymes, and so on) have been introduced as a novel modification for leachate treatment. This work, therefore, has been dedicated to comprehensively reviewing all nanomaterial based leachate treatment techniques. In this regard, the first part of this review will discuss the nano catalyst, nano adsorbent along with their synthesis and mechanistic view of pollutant removal potential. In the second part, the nanomaterial-based microbial conjugates applied in the leachate treatments have been discussed. Apart from this, various other nanomaterial-based methods have been discussed in the third part of the review. Hence this review is providing an insight of all the recent developments pertaining to the nano material based leachate treatment techniques.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) are witnessing a surge in demand and production for their environmental benefits. This study reviews the development of electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) in transport logistics. The review found that few existing EVRP models considered integrally the unique characteristics of EVs, such as the nonlinear charging function, nonlinear electricity-consumption function, and dynamic driving ranges. This study develops a new comprehensive model of the EVRP that considers a general energy/electricity consumption function for EVs that factor in energy losses (aerodynamic, tire friction, drivetrain, ancillary, and kinetic/potential losses), nonlinear charging function with the piecewise linearization technique, efficient visits to charge stations, and continuous decision variables for speed, payload, travel time, recharging, etc. The newly developed model is much closer to reality by integrating most of the unique characteristics of EVs known so far, and therefore it advances the state-of-the-art in EVRP. Computational experiments on Solomon's instances were done to exhibit the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed model under the effects of air conditioner, battery capacity, and travel speed. These experiments demonstrated that the model can obtain more practical logistics plans for an EV fleet with a lower total emissions cost and higher energy utilization.

AB  - Purpose In this paper, the prior research on virtual teams was reviewed to assess the state of the literature. The purpose of this paper is to determine why individuals prefer working in virtual teams (also termed liquid workers and part-time workers). Previous researchers have focussed on the benefits that organizations receive if they hire liquid workers, but to date, no research has been conducted to determine the perspective of these liquid workers. The various definitions of virtual teams are discussed and an integrative definition is proposed that suggests all teams may be defined in terms of their extent of virtualness. Design/methodology approach A systematic review of the literature on virtual teams was conducted. The data were collected from 12 informants. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings Six main themes were identified, namely, pliability, opportunities, increased earnings, vigour, family and transportation.
   Originality/value The current study is novel as there is a paucity of research in identifying the factors behind working in the virtual community in India. This study presents the first research of its kind to the best knowledge of the author, and the findings will be valuable for companies who are looking for cost savings.

AB  - The growing demand for animal products leads to mounting environmental impacts from the livestock sector. In light of the desired transition from linear to circular nutrient flows and an increasing number of formal commitments toward reducing environmental impacts from livestock production, manure valorization using insects (particularly black soldier fly larvae; BSFL) gains increasing importance. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this paper identified 75 BSFL production systems utilizing various types of manure as feed substrates. The review highlights considerable differences in system design regarding the different production steps and their specific characteristics. These differences lead to a wide spectrum of rearing performances, which were measured by a suite of indicators, including dry matter reduction (DMR), waste reduction index (WRI), feed conversion efficiency (FCE), bioconversion rate (BCR), and nitrogen reduction. The results further show that, to date, most manure-valorizing BSFL production systems operate at the micro-scale level. However, specific reduction targets for manure-related emissions will likely necessitate large-scale systems at the farm or industrial level, and further research should thus focus on the comprehensive assessment of potential environmental benefits of manure valorization using BSFL.

AB  - Wind energy is a key component of climate action strategies aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions be-tween a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities.

AB  - Background: Conservation decisions not only impact wildlife, habitat, and environmental health, but also human wellbeing and social justice. The inclusion of safeguards and equity considerations in the conservation field has increasingly garnered attention in international policy processes and amongst conservation practitioners. Yet, what constitutes an 'equitable' solution can take many forms, and how the concept is treated within conservation research is not standardized. This review explores how social equity is conceptualized and assessed in conservation research.
   Methods/Design: Using a structured search and screening process, we identified 138 peer-reviewed studies that addressed equity in relation to conservation actions. The authors developed a coding framework to guide the review process, focusing on the current state of, definitions used for, and means of assessing social equity in empirical conservation research.
   Review Results: Results show that empirical research on social equity in conservation is rapidly growing, with the majority of studies on the topic published only since 2009. Equity within conservation research is skewed toward distributional concerns and to a lesser extent procedural issues, with recognition and contextual equity receiving little attention. Studies are primarily situated in forested biomes of the Global South. Conservation interventions mostly resulted in mixed or negative impacts on equity.
   Synthesis and Discussion: Our results demonstrate the current limitations of research on equity in conservation, and raise challenging questions about the social impacts of conservation and how to ameliorate equity concerns. Framing of equity within conservation research would benefit from greater transparency of study motivation, more explicit definition of how equity is used within the study context, and consideration for how best to assess it. We recommend that the empirical conservation literature more deeply engage with different notions of equity when studying, planning, and implementing actions to address potential trade-offs among equity and conservation objectives and beneficiaries.

AB  - Increasing intensity and frequency of climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts challenge existing governance models of disaster risk reduction. This paper systematically reviews 147 articles on pre-disaster planning and preparedness for floods and droughts in developed countries. The results show: 1) the formal adoption of an integrated system of disaster risk reduction and human development remains fragmented due to a lack of legislative and policy frameworks; 2) there is a trend toward the privatization of risk management by devolving responsibility for disaster liability to landowners; 3) planning and preparedness is more common for floods than droughts in the disaster literature; and 4) flood management is increasingly risk-oriented, whereas drought management in the disaster literature remains dominated by a crisis management framework. Integration of pre-disaster planning and preparedness with human development initiatives requires further investigation to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local, national and international scales.

AB  - IntroductionMost nurses and midwives do not feel adequately prepared to respond to the complex trauma and social and cultural needs of female clients who have experienced trafficking. There are data to support a lack of knowledge among health care providers about the types of human trafficking as well as poor structural supports within health care systems. The purpose of this review was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global health care experiences of females who have experienced trafficking. MethodsNoblit and Hare's 7-step meta-ethnographic approach was used. We analyzed constructs, concepts, themes, and metaphors using reciprocal translations. The guidelines for preferred reporting the synthesis of qualitative research were adhered to enhancing transparency (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). ResultsThe collaborative search process in the PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus databases resulted in 7 high-quality research studies published between January 2016 and January 2021. Most studies explored individuals' experiences of trafficking and views of health care services, challenges, and service use barriers. A total of 228 female survivors who experienced trafficking participated. They primarily experienced trafficking within different parts of North America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Three main themes emerged: privacy, confidentiality, and identity problems; powerlessness; and clinician recognition and responsiveness. DiscussionAll participants reported being exposed to extremely high levels of physical and mental abuse before, during, and after exiting trafficking. Therefore, clinicians will require ongoing training and clearer guidance from clinical leadership to adequately care for the varying health needs of women and girls who have experienced trafficking or are currently in a trafficking situation. Adoption of a culturally sensitive, patient-centered, and trauma-informed approach is needed, as clients' reasons for staying in a trafficking situation vary. Relationships of trust should be formed in which rapport is cocreated and in which members of the health care team and client work hand in hand together to envision, identify, and pursue future-oriented and strength-based goals toward healing.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important tool to evaluate environmental 'hot spots' in livestock systems and recommend production improvements. However, it is common for livestock LCA to investigate only a narrow subset of environmental impacts to simplify results for decision-makers, which makes it difficult to fully understand the tradeoffs among environmental impacts and identify the most relevant mitigation options. We completed a systematic review of the livestock LCA literature to better understand the impact categories included and the progress made towards more comprehensive LCA. Our search of publications between 2000 and 2016 identified 173 relevant peer-reviewed papers. Nearly all the publications (98%) included climate change as an impact category and almost one-third of the publications (28%) focused solely on that one category. Biodiversity, ionizing radiation, and particulate matter were the least common categories addressed. Cattle LCA, including dairy or beef, were the livestock species most frequently evaluated. Our analysis shows that while the number of multi-category livestock LCA (LCA with 4 or more impact categories) increased over time, LCA including 1-3 impact categories (which we define as "simplified LCA") increased at a higher rate than multi-category LCA. Simplified LCA therefore remain the most prevalent in the literature. Publications that included multiple impact categories were better able to identify environmental impact tradeoffs among livestock production systems and management scenarios. To compare results across livestock LCA studies, it is necessary to increase the standardization of system boundaries, functional units, impact frameworks and mandatory inputs. The optional steps of normalization and weighting in the life cycle impact assessment can also help decision makers prioritize which environmental impacts to address. More work that includes a greater number of impact categories in livestock LCA is sorely needed to more fully understand and to harmonize the communication of the environmental performance of livestock production systems.

AB  - This paper investigates how risks are anticipated in national bioenergy policies and in which way related expectations that harms can be prevented or mitigated have actually been met. The paper draws on the national biofuel policies of ten countries and the EU, selected to represent a diverse sample of regions, producers and consumers, and pioneers and latecomers. It proceeds in two steps: firstly, it identifies three risk categories most frequently mentioned across the investigated national policies. Secondly, it conducts a systematic review of available empirical research about biofuels' effects in these risk categories. Findings are discussed regarding the empirical conditions under which related expectations to do no harm have materialized or failed; and concerning the challenges of risks perception and management in actual policies. We observe issues of crop selection and inadequate sectoral governance of biofuels, but also challenges of large-scale modes of intensive production. Effective risk mitigation was often the result of risk adverse choices by contract farmers engaged in biofuels production. National policy documents have insufficiently conceptualized 'do no harm' concepts and strategies in place to address these performance issues; while remaining silent on the particular risk governance and accountability framework that keeps track of actual developments, commitments and responsibilities.

AB  - The worst rates of preventable mortality and morbidity among women and children occur in humanitarian settings. Reliable, easy-to-use, standardized, and efficient tools for data collection are needed to enable different organizations to plan and act in the most effective way. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a review of tools for data collection on the health of women and children in humanitarian emergencies. An update of this review was conducted to investigate whether the recommendations made were taken forward and to identify newly developed tools. Fifty-three studies and 5 new tools were identified. Only 1 study used 1 of the tools identified in our search. Little has been done in terms of the previous recommendations. Authors may not be aware of the availability of such tools and of the importance of documenting their data using the same methods as other researchers. Currently used tools may not be suitable for use in humanitarian settings or may not include the domains of the authors' interests. The development of standardized instruments should be done with all key workers in the area and could be coordinated by the WHO.

AB  - Horizon scanning for high-risk invasive non-native species (INNS) is crucial in preparing and implementing measures to prevent introductions, as well as to focus efforts in the control of species already present. We initiated a trans-national horizon-scanning exercise focused on four countries in western Europe: Great Britain, France, Belgium and The Netherlands, which share similar environmental and socio-economic characteristics. We followed a structured four-step approach combining existing knowledge about INNS, with a collaborative identification of priorities for research and management: (1) systematic review of potential INNS of concern, (2) discrimination of INNS into an Alert and Black List depending on their absence or presence in the study area respectively, (3) risk analysis of the Alert List, and (4) expert ranking of species in the Black List. Amongst species not yet present in the four countries (i.e. Alert List), assessors reliably pointed to the Emerald ash-borer (Agrilus planipennis) and Sosnowski's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi) as those INNS with the highest risk of invasion and impact. The Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) were consistently highlighted as some of the most problematic INNS already present in the study area (i.e. Black List). The advantages of our combined approach include that it is inclusive of all-taxa, prioritizes both established and emerging biological threats across trans-national scales, and considers not only the ecological impact, but also potential direct economic consequences as well as the manageability of invasive species.

AB  - The effects of trees on residential energy demand have been extensively studied over the past several decades; yet a comprehensive analysis of their magnitude, variation and emerging issues and evidence has not been updated in the literature. Given this gap, a systematic review was conducted by assessing major disciplines, geographic distributions, methods and reported energy-saving performances for cooling and heating residential homes. An overwhelming majority of literature focused on single family housing types in North America, with a strong geographic concentration in California. In North America, 40 peer-reviewed studies were published from 1979 to 2017 by 19 different journals across disciplines. Researchers used simulation modeling and empirical approaches in roughly equal proportions. The review confirms that the conceptual and empirical evidence to support trees' energy saving effects is solid, especially for cooling effects, but the magnitude of reported energysavings widely varied depending on climate, method, data and assumptions for buildings and trees. A building with trees used 2.3% to 90% less cooling energy, mostly through shading effects, and 1% to 20% less heating energy through windbreak effects, in comparison to buildings without trees. Takeaways for evidence-based urban greening are that practitioners and researchers should: i) pay careful attention to different methods and assumptions used when interpreting and comparing research findings ii) pursue long-term monitoring and evidence-based management to enhance tree survival and growth; iii) incorporate emerging trade-offs and synergies such as rooftop solar energy, water conservation, and net carbon savings into design and policies; and iv) prioritize planting for underserved and vulnerable communities.

AB  - As the global population increases, the expansion of road networks has led to the destruction and disturbance of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Road-related stressors have significant effects on both lotic and lentic habitats. While there are several systematic reviews that evaluate the effects of roads on lotic environments, there are none that consider their effects on lentic habitats only. We conducted a literature review to achieve two objectives: (1) to summarize the effects of roads on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lentic environments; and (2) to identify biases and gaps in our current knowledge of the effects of roads on lentic habitats, so that we could find promising areas for future research. Our review found 172 papers published between 1970 and 2020. The most frequently studied stressors associated with roads included road salt and heavy metal contamination (67 and 43 papers, respectively), habitat fragmentation (37 papers), and landscape change (14 papers). These stressors can lead to alterations in conductivity and chloride levels, changes in lake stratification patterns, increases in heavy metal concentrations in water and organisms, and significant mortality as amphibians disperse across roadways. We also identified a variety of other stressors that may be understudied based on their frequency of appearance in our search results, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, road dust, increased accessibility, hydrological changes, noise pollution, dust suppressants, sedimentation, invasive species introductions, and water withdrawal. Our review indicated that there are strong geographic biases in published studies, with 57.0% examining North American sites and 30.2% examining European sites. Furthermore, there were taxonomic biases in the published literature, with most studies focusing on amphibians (41.7%), fish (15.6%), and macroinvertebrates (14.6%), while few considered zooplankton (8.3%), diatoms (7.3%), amoebas (5.2%), water birds (3.1%), reptiles (2.1%), and macrophytes (1.0%). Based on our review, we have identified promising areas for future research for each of the major stressors related to roadways. However, we speculate that rectifying the geographic and taxonomic bias of our current knowledge could significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of roads on lentic environments, thereby better informing environmental management of these important habitats.

AB  - IntroductionLearning is a key attribute of a resilient health system and, therefore, is central to health system strengthening. The main objective of this study was to analyse how Guinea's health system has learnt from the response to outbreaks between 2014 and 2021.MethodsWe used a retrospective longitudinal single embedded case study design, applying the framework conceptualised by Sheikh and Abimbola for analysing learning health systems. Data were collected employing a mixed methods systematic review carried out in March 2022 and an online survey conducted in April 2022.ResultsThe 70 reports included in the evidence synthesis were about the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD), Measles, Lassa Fever, COVID-19, 2021 EVD and Marburg virus disease. The main lessons were from 2014 to 2016 EVD and included: early community engagement in the response, social mobilisation, prioritising investment in health personnel, early involvement of anthropologists, developing health infrastructure and equipment and ensuring crisis communication. They were learnt through information (research and experts' opinions), action/practice and double-loop and were progressively incorporated in the response to future outbreaks through deliberation, single-loop, double-loop and triple-loop learning. However, advanced learning aspects (learning through action, double-loop and triple-loop) were limited within the health system. Nevertheless, the health system successfully controlled COVID-19, the 2021 EVD and Marburg virus disease. Survey respondents' commonly reported that enablers were the creation of the national agency for health security and support from development partners. Barriers included cultural and political issues and lack of funding. Common recommendations included establishing a knowledge management unit within the Ministry of Health with representatives at regional and district levels, investing in human capacities and improving the governance and management system.ConclusionOur study highlights the importance of learning. The health system performed well and achieved encouraging and better outbreak response outcomes over time with learning that occurred.

AB  - A circular economy (CE) transforms the linear system into a resource flow model based on reusing products and materials and increasing lifetime periods. This academic work aims to review the current CE research status from business, economic, and managerial (BEM) research perspectives. We carried out a systematic and bibliometric analysis to gather information on the current state of the art applications and learn about the leading research topics and sources. To reach these goals, we reviewed 962 research papers published in journals indexed on the Web of Science. After analysing the articles, three categories emerged worldwide: literature reviews, case studies, and frameworks and guidelines based on the current closed-loop system approach. Results evidence that BEM research in the CE is focused on the existing barriers to adopting a CE. More concretely, findings show that CEs are being slowed by the fact that citizens and companies do not know how to be circular. At the same time, the article showcases how the BEM areas and the recurring topics in CE research are increasingly being developed by collaborations between engineers and economists to design and create robust and measurable closed-loop models.

AB  - International trade in soybean has been increasing exponentially over the last 30 years, stimulating agricultural expansion and intensification, primarily in South America. Trade in soybean has been promoted by national and international agencies to stimulate economic development in low-and middle-income countries. Trade in soybean has generated an increase in GDP and average income in producing countries, but soybean production is also linked to negative effects on the well-being of local populations, such as land appropriation and increased social conflicts among communities. In addition, soybean production is linked to extensive deforestation and clearance of natural vegetation as well as water pollution due to intensive agricultural practices, which in turn has negative impacts on human well-being. As such, more information is needed to understand the range of negative and positive impacts of soybean production on people and the environment.& nbsp;This study presents a systematic literature review of the direct and indirect social-economic impacts of soybean agricultural production for trade. We employ the concept of multi-dimensional well-being to classify the various direct social impacts that have been found in the literature and the concept of ecosystem services to classify indirect social impacts, as the contribution of natural ecosystems to human well-being. The main finding of the review is that the empirical evidence for direct social impacts of soy production is scarce and mixed in terms of direction of impact. More tangible dimensions such as income, nutrition and living standards are more often positively impacted by soy trade, while more intangible dimensions such as freedom of choice and cultural value are found to be negatively affected. The empirical evidence for impacts on ecosystem services is more comprehensive and shows a clear picture of negative impacts associated with soybean production due to land use changes and deforestation, and agricultural intensification. There is hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of sustainable value chain policies.

AB  - The sheer size, growth, and complexity of cities worldwide are creating an ever-increasing burden of negative externalities on society and the environment. This systematic review aims to illuminate the broad range of negative urban development externalities and to analyze them in way that sharpens our ability to perceive, anticipate, and manage them. After finding that negative urban development externalities are more complex and diverse than has been previously articulated in the literature, the paper categorizes a representative sample by type (social, environmental, and economic) and identifies three modes of impact (visibility, emergence, and distribution) that make them extremely challenging to anticipate and mitigate. The most problematic negative externalities are social or environmental, with low visibility, cumulative patterns of emergence, and effects that extend beyond regulating jurisdictions. The analysis then draws on welfare economics to strengthen the case for the proactive management of these negative externalities and analyzes the competencies and capacities of local governments to strategically intervene in order to more effectively achieve sustainable development.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the extant literature of workplace spirituality (WPS) in a manner that helps us trace its emergence in management practices in the past twelve years and to identify the gaps to be addressed by researchers in near future. Design/methodology/approach A two-step screening process was followed to extract the papers from various databases. The paper reviews one hundred fifty-nine conceptual and empirical articles published in more than fifty journals from 2010 to 2021. Leading databases like EBSCO, Scopus and ProQuest were extensively searched. The papers were analysed and grouped to arrive at the themes and classification criteria. Findings Despite numerous studies and extensive research in the past decade, the construct of WPS lacks a conclusive definition and has overlapping dimensions. It is a multidimensional concept having personal, psychological and social aspects. It is a dominant field in organisational behaviour domain. Research limitations/implications The review explains the multidisciplinary nature of WPS, having roots in organisational behaviour, psychology and theology. Further, the paper provides a clear picture of the present state of literature and enumerates future research avenues which will enable the researchers to further expand the area of WPS. Practical implications The review highlights multiple positive attitudinal outcomes that managers can attain through WPS-related initiatives. Various techniques like prayer breaks, meditation and yoga can be used by the managers for spiritual incorporation process. Originality/value This study acquires significance, for, unlike previous studies, it does not propose that inclusion of WPS will always be gainful, rather it also broaches its potential harm, if incorporated sans due caution. Considering the complexity of spiritual beliefs, it will enable managers to weigh the pros-cons of such inclusion. The research gaps identified in the review will help future researchers in furthering the field of WPS.

KW  - European Union
AB  - The generation of waste causes several problems, the most worrying being environmental damage, causing irreparable damage to ecosystems, polluting water, land and air. In this sense, the research objective is to analyze how urban solid waste management is carried out in the European Union (EU) in the period 2010-2020. The methodology used corresponds to the systematic review, which is part of the evidence-based approach to policy and practice. The results obtained throughout the investigation show that, despite the important effort made by the EU to increase recycling and composting, it is necessary to advance in the treatment of solid waste in various member states (such as Bulgaria, Greece or Romania). In this context, collection-based policies seem not to have been sufficient to promote sustainability in the field of urban waste management. As a proposed recommendation, the development of policies based on human behavior is framed, which influence a change in behavior, social and cultural, to achieve the objectives related to sustainability and the efficient use of resources.

AB  - The development of poverty-stricken areas presents a critical challenge to achieving social sustainability. The emergence of pro-poor tourism provides a promising option for poverty alleviation and is attracting increasing attention. Previous studies have attempted to explore the effectiveness and patterns of pro-poor tourism. Currently, a quantitative and systematic review of pro-poor tourism (PPT) research seems to be missing. Thus, a scientometric approach is employed to build a knowledge map, with the aim of using bibliometric data to provide an objective and holistic perspective on PPT. Through the co-occurrence, cluster, and co-citation analyses of 164 related papers published from 2002 to 2018, six major themes (i.e., development, tourism management, sustainable tourism, protected areas, poverty, and slum tourism) are selected to showcase the current status of PPT research. Through the lens of a capabilities-based resource perspective, a three-dimensional PPT framework (including focus, emphasis, and motivation) is developed to structure future research.

AB  - Background: Health policy in Australia positions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workers (AHWs) as central to improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' health, with high expectations of their contribution to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health outcomes. Understanding how AHWs' governance and accountability relationships influence their ability to address such health inequities has policy, programme and ethical significance. We sought to map the evidence of AHWs' experiences of accountability in the Australian health system.
   Methods: We followed an adapted qualitative systematic review process to map evidence on accountability relations in the published literature. We sought empirical studies or first-person accounts describing AHWs' experiences of working in government or Aboriginal community-controlled services anywhere in Australia. Findings were organised according to van Belle and Mayhew's four dimensions of accountability-social, political, provider and organisational.
   Results: Of 27 included studies, none had a primary focus on AHW governance or AHWs' accountability relationships. Nonetheless, selected articles provided some insight into AHWs' experiences of accountability across van Belle and Mayhew's four dimensions. In the social dimension, AHWs' sense of connection and belonging to community was reflected in the importance placed on AHWs' cultural brokerage and advocacy functions. But social and cultural obligations overlapped and sometimes clashed with organisational and provider-related accountabilities. AHWs described having to straddle cultural obligations (e.g. related to gender, age and kinship) alongside the expectations of non-Indigenous colleagues and supervisors which were underpinned by 'Western' models of clinical governance and management. Lack of role-clarity stemming from weakly constituted (state-based) career structures was linked to a system-wide misunderstanding of AHWs' roles and responsibilities-particularly the cultural components-acting as a barrier to AHWs working to their full capacity for the benefit of patients, broader society and their own professional satisfaction.
   Conclusions: In literature spanning different geographies, service domains and several decades, this review found evidence of complexity in AHWs' accountability relationships that both affects individual and team performance. However, theoretically informed and systematic investigation of accountability relationships and related issues, including the power dynamics that underpin AHW governance and performance in often diverse settings, remains limited and more work in this area is required.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of land-based generic physical activity interventions on pain, physical function, and physical performance in individuals with hip/knee osteoarthritis, when compared with a control group that received no intervention, minimal intervention, or usual care.
   Methods: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials on 11 electronic databases (from their inception up until April 30, 2016) identified 27 relevant articles. According to the compendium of physical activities, interventions were categorized into: recreational activities (tai chi/Baduajin-6 articles), walking (9 articles), and conditioning exercise (12 articles).
   Results: Meta-analysis for recreational activity (n = 3) demonstrated significant mean difference (MD) of -9.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.95 to -5.17) for physical function (Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Arthritis Index) at 3 mos from randomization. Pooled estimate for walking intervention was not significant for pain intensity and physical performance but was significant for physical function (n = 2) with a MD of -10.38 (95% CI, -12.27 to -8.48) at 6 mos. Meta-analysis for conditioning exercise was significant for physical function (n = 3) with a MD of -3.74 (95% CI, -5.70 to -1.78) and physical performance (6-minute walk test) with a MD of 42.72 m (95% CI, 27.78, 57.66) at 6 mos. The timed stair-climbing test (n = 2) demonstrated a significant effect at 18 mos with a MD of -0.49 secs (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.23).
   Conclusion: Very limited evidence to support recreational activity and walking intervention was found for knee osteoarthritis, in the short-term on pain and physical function, respectively.

AB  - The marble industry in Mexico, similarly to the international market, is going through some problems which are characterized by low productivity performance, inconsistency in management and administrative organization, high raw material waste, and negative social and environmental impact. The methodology used in this paper is based on a systematic review of the strategies and solutions used to address these problems reported between 2014 and 2021, including the results of the application of in situ surveys to three marble companies in the Mixteca Poblana region. These surveys are collected in this article alongside industry experience to propose, in a structured way, a three-pronged management approach with the aim of directing the marble industry towards a sustainable industry model. The structure of this approach, based on forms of capital and sustainability dimensions, engages governments, companies, schools and society to guide this industrial sector to become a sustainable business, integrating knowledge and experience of the marble industry processes. We recommend adding performance metrics to this approach to assess the value chain of the marble industry.

AB  - Scenario analysis (SA) provides a useful tool to envision the future conditions of urban ecosystem services (UES), but our understanding of how SA has been used in UES research is rather limited. Thus, this study was intended to (1) review scenario analysis-based urban ecosystem services (SA-UES) studies; and (2) synthesize the main findings that can help improving urban planning and management. By adopting a systematic review procedure, we identified and analyzed 103 relevant articles from Web of Science. We found that SA-UES research comprises primarily studies geared towards urban landscape planning/management (Type I) and green infrastructure (GI) planning/management (Type II), with the former exploring the impacts of multiple land use/cover types on UES and the latter evaluating the potential of GI to provide UES. About 93% of the examined cities were located in Asia, Americas, and Europe, with Type I research accounting for 80%, 46%, and 41% of the total number of publications in each continent, respectively. SA-UES research pursued mainly city-scale, spatially-explicit, and exploratory scenarios, with regulating services mostly considered. The most often considered scenario drivers were urban land demand and natural land protection in Type I research, and GI quantity and spatial location in Type II research. UES scenarios were mainly represented quantitively using five types of approaches: adapting existing scenarios, GIS-based mapping, land use/cover change model, tree growth model, and optimization method. UES were most often evaluated by adopting biophysical approaches (64%), followed by monetary approaches (22%). SA-UES studies have shown that the same drivers may have contrasting impacts on UES in different contexts. Thus, sustaining UES requires context-specific solutions, which can be facilitated by the use of SA. To move forward, SA-UES research should further promote the holistic landscape approach that integrates both green and non-green infrastructures, with more emphasis on climate change, policy intervention and stakeholders-participatory scenarios, and cultural services.

AB  - Malaysia is the world's second largest producer of palm oil, which, not unexpectedly, is one of the largest contributors to the country's GDP. However, the Malaysian palm oil industry faces numerous issues, including a boycott for imports into the European Union (EU) on the basis that Malaysia does not allegedly practice good agriculture, fails to meet sustainability standards and exploits labor rights. To overcome the situation, the Government of Malaysia is strongly committed to implementing good agricultural practices that meet international sustainability standards through sustainable certification. To facilitate the adoption of sustainable certification by smallholder palm oil producers, through a comprehensive review of the literature, this study seeks to identify the social, environmental and economic benefits derived from sustainable certification.

AB  - Health tourism is when patients travel to another state (or within a country) to improve or restore health (Hudson and Li, 2012). Recent studies show that health care spending is on the rise, averaging around 9 percent of GDP in OECD countries, and that the right balance needs to be struck between spending on disease prevention and treatment. Assessing the problem field of the health tourism industry and the current situation, the following key problems are identified: lack of communication and support between health tourism policy makers and health tourism organizations; lack of a culture of cooperation and organizational partnership between the public and private sectors; lack of strategic planning; gaps in the targeted distribution of responsibilities between actors in the health tourism network; resistance of the public and private sector to change. Thus, the article solves the problem - how to ensure the effective application of the principles of organizational wisdom in the health tourism industry? According to the authors, it is expedient for the organizations involved in this complex field of tourism to base their activities on the principles of organizational wisdom. The aim of the article is to propose the application of the principles of organizational wisdom in the health tourism industry. For the systematic review, scientific articles were searched in databases: Cambridge Journals Online; EBSCO; Emerald Publishing; SAGE Journals Online; Science direct; Taylor & Francis. The scientific articles included in the systematic review cover the period 1999-2020. The following methods are used to present the results of the research: comparative analysis, synthesis, graphical representation and generalization. The study identified the following essential principles of organizational wisdom that are appropriate to adapt in the health tourism industry: transformational leadership; organizational culture, management structure and teamwork; recognition of environmental change and rapid and effective response to it; systemic thinking; interaction between different organizations that can lead to high-quality solutions (innovation); the ability to accumulate organizational memory to compare past and present situations and decisions made. The authors in the article substantiate the opinion that the sustainability of the application of these principles depends on the mechanism of organizational partnership in organizing/ creating health tourism cooperative. Such an organization has: a balanced structure and clearly defined roles and responsibilities of participants; long-term commitments are matched by specific short-term objectives that can be measured; periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the role played by each partner; accurate and effective communication between partners and all stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to synthesize theoretical and empirical studies on the food dimension of developments in cultural omnivorousness. Cultural omnivorousness is an antithesis which Peterson developed against Bourdieu's stratification theory that emerged in 1992, and it has been the subject of scientific research in different dimensions, including literature, music, art and food.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, databases were systematically searched to identify publications on cultural omnivorousness and food. The data obtained in the study was appraised using the checklist of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA).
   Findings - This study concluded that research on cultural omnivoriusness and food is often investigated from a demand perspective. Findings indicated that the relationship between food and cultural omnivorousness is focused on the axis of eating out, restaurant types and preferences, regions where restaurants are located, liked/ preferred food, vegetarianism, the healthy/unhealthy state of food, locality and economic value of preferred food. Moreover, comparing the reviewed study results, it was identified that multiple regression was mostly used in quantitative research, and content analysis was benefited in qualitative research.
   Research limitations/implications - The reviewed studies were limited to articles with open access and peer-reviewed journals over the period 1990-2020. In addition, this study adopted a qualitative research approach. Another limitation of the research is that it only examined cultural omnivorousness in terms of food.
   Practical implications - It is noticed that the results of the research conducted regarding the relationship between cultural omnivorousness and food vary by countries and cities. The reason for this situation might be the different historical processes and development levels of the countries and the difference in the symbols represented by food in this process. Additionally, in practical terms, this research offers some implications for how the relationship between cultural omnivorousness and food can be used by supply. Restaurants from a consumer perspective and destinations from a tourist perspective can use cultural omnivorousness as a strategic element in their marketing planning.
   Originality/value - The literature on cultural omnivorousness is used to make sense of a striking phenomenon, namely the tastes/likes of individuals in the middle and upper classes. However, there has not been found such an examination of food and its use in cultural omnivorousness studies. This article fills the identified gap, adding to the discussion on food and cultural omnivorusness and provides a related research agenda.

AB  - The socio-ecological systems (SESs) framework provides cross-disciplinary insight into complex environmental problems. Numerous studies have applied the SES framework to coastal and marine environments over the last two decades. We review and analyze 98 of those studies to (i) describe how SES concepts were examined and measured, (ii) describe how the studies included feedbacks and thresholds, and (iii) identify and analyze elements unique to coastal and marine SES frameworks. We find that progress has been made in understanding key SES properties in coastal and marine ecosystems, which include resilience, adaptive capacity, vulnerability, and governance. A variety of methods has been developed and applied to analyze these features qualitatively and quantitatively. We also find that recent studies have incorporated land-based stressors in their analyses of coastal issues related to nutrient runoff, bacterial pollution, and management of anadromous species to represent explicit links in land-to-sea continuums. However, the literature has yet to identify methods and data that can be used to provide causal evidence of non-linearities and thresholds within SES. In addition, our findings suggest that greater alignment and consistency are needed in models with regard to metrics and spatial boundaries between ecological and social systems to take full advantage of the SES framework and improve coastal and marine management.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between high performance work practices (HPWPs) and cross-cultural dimensions to debate the effectiveness of HPWPs in cross-cultural settings. Using systematic review, 140 articles were identified on HPWPs and cross-cultural human resource management. Synthesizing the two literature areas results in four key findings. Many HR practices labelled as HPWPs are affected by national cultural dimensions. Also, several practices labelled as HPWPs have not been a part of the cross-cultural HR literature, and that limited studies in both area focus on the impact of cultural compatibility on outcomes. Finally, a few selected cultural dimensions have dominated the cross-cultural HR literature. Thus, more work is needed to: understand the role of national culture on effectiveness of HPWPs; increase coverage of HPWPs in the cross-cultural HR literature; understand the impact of cultural compatibility of HR practices and HPWPs on outcomes; and, incorporate additional cultural dimensions in future work.

AB  - 193 United Nations members are signatories of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Even though it does not make it legally binding to the country members, the SDGs establishment incites national and managerial frameworks to achieve the SDGs. The mining industry inserts itself in this context by its global presence and frequent location within ecologically sensitive and less developed areas. This paper aims to consolidate the state of academic research on mining, sustainability and sustainable development, by organizing the results of previous studies within a systematic review on the SDGs set. To do so, the ISI Web of Science (TM) Core Collection database was chosen as a database of record, as it is one of the most widespread databases of academic journals. We have used all years available in the ISI database, from 1945 to 2016 (for complete years). The systematic review process comprised of five steps: (i) to search terms [("sustainability" or "sustainable development") and mining] on the database and to apply filters of criteria; (ii) organizing papers; (iii) metrics and relations between papers and authors; (iv) classification of the results through content analysis techniques; and (v) synthesis. The results were divided in two groups: the highly cited and the most recent papers, to include papers that have academic impact and those which show the newest contributions to the field. The results showed that, in spite of a growing amount of publications in the past years that relates to mining and sustainability, the main focus of these publications are still on the environmental dimensions of the UN goals. This suggests that more practical and academic work in the mining sector are required to fill in the blank spaces regarding the other set of goals that compose the SDGs framework.

AB  - This article provides a systematic review of the potential and limitations of mobile phones in the delivery of rural services for agricultural and rural development in developing countries. The review indicates a rapid expansion of research in recent years, and a growing number of primary research studies that have developed rigorous methodologies for data collection and analysis, with welcome contribution from developing country institutions and researchers. Gaps in the literature suggest areas where future research priorities may lie. These include the provision of agricultural data sources that can provide the basis for effective planning and policymaking, and the assessment of information and service needs that take into account gender differences and the potential for user involvement in the design of service provision. Research is also needed to assess the potential for financial market integration, sustainable business models, consideration of indicators of sector performance and productivity, and assessment of broader impacts at the community and societal level.

AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) has been adopted as a strategy for food security in urban areas. This study identified the conditions for development of UA through a systematic review of UA case studies. It classified the enabling and constraining conditions within the three compositional elements of UA - necessity, ability, and opportunity - and determined the primary and secondary conditions for UA design by the country income group. The following conditions are required for both high-income and low/ middle-income countries: Motivation/public awareness; labour/human resources; policy and institutional infrastructure; social capital; and arable land and resources for farming. Agricultural education/training and research and technical development are needed for low and middle-income countries as the key secondary conditions. In high-income countries, a lack of farmers' knowledge and urban development are the main challenges to UA implementation. Therefore, the research findings could be meaningful evidence for making decisions and designing UA policies for sustainable food production.

AB  - Adopting environmentally friendly or green technology and incorporating new alternative substrates for a sustainable agricultural industry has garnered the attention of numerous researchers. Although super absorbent hydrogels have exhibited great potential, natural hydrogel-based absorbents have gained more interest due to their environmentally safe properties. The sources for the novel green polymer are easily obtained from agricultural wastes, such as polysaccharides, agarose, chitosan, and mucilage, with zero to minimal cost. The polymer also offers several attributes, including water usage and cost efficiencies, versatile application, and increasing plant growth. Furthermore, the polymer can act as a carrier agent and aid in improving the properties of planting mediums. The present review focuses on natural and chemical hydrogel-based polymers. It discusses their potential application in sustainable agriculture and the conservation of ecosystems by providing balanced protection for seeds, plants, and soil. Future perspectives based on previous investigations are also presented.

AB  - As the global population continues to increase, projected to reach an estimated 9.7 billion people by 2050, there will be a growing demand for food production and agricultural resources. Transition toward Agriculture 4.0 is expected to enhance agricultural productivity through the integration of advanced technologies, increase resource efficiency, ensure long-term food security by applying more sustainable farming practices, and enhance resilience and climate change adaptation. By integrating technologies such as ground IoT sensing and remote sensing, via both satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and exploiting data fusion and data analytics, farming can make the transition to a more efficient, productive, and sustainable paradigm. The present work performs a systematic literature review (SLR), identifying the challenges associated with UAV, Satellite, and Ground Sensing in their application in agriculture, comparing them and discussing their complementary use to facilitate Precision Agriculture (PA) and transition to Agriculture 4.0.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Globally, efforts are being made to reduce the menace of maternal death in order to achieve the sustainable development goal. Maternal death has been associated with inadequate Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness (BPCR), especially in low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, this review assessed birth preparedness and complication readiness in Nigeria.METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published research articles on birth preparedness and complication readiness in Nigeria were done using PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases. All published articles from inception to November 2018 were included in the review. A total of 8,913 published articles were identified from an electronic search, and a total of 4,440 studies were included in this review, while only 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of "good BPCR" for all studies yielded an estimate of 58.7% (95% CI 43.9%-72.7%). The I 2 statistic was 98%, indicating statistically significant heterogeneity among the studies. The percentage of women with good birth preparedness and complication readiness increases with the year of publication, such that women have tended to be more aware of good birth preparedness and complication readiness in recent years. More than half of the women had knowledge of obstetric danger signs (52.0%, 95% CI 39.5%-64.4%, 10 studies), arranged for transportation (59.5%, 95% CI 36.2%-80.7%, 11 studies), or saved money (63.4%, 95% CI 44.7%-80.2%, 11 studies) as part of the BPCR.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO number CRD42019123220.CONCLUSION: Women in Nigeria are better prepared for birth preparedness and complication readiness in recent years. Therefore, interventions to promote more adequate birth preparedness and complication readiness among women are recommended.

AB  - Feed production is a significant contributor to the environmental footprint of livestock products. Feed formulation may therefore provide valuable opportunities to reduce impacts and improve sustainability outcomes in livestock production. Goal programming (GP) is currently the leading multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool used in feed formulation, taking into account cost and nutritional considerations only. Environmental goals are not typically included. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a commonly utilized tool used to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of environmental impacts along product supply chains. LCAs of feed inputs can produce information that enables discriminating among feed inputs based on the resource/environmental impacts characteristic of their production, processing, and transportation. The purpose of this review is to identify the necessary elements of a framework for the integration of regionalized life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results for laying hen feed input supply chains into goal programming-based feed formulation. In this way, the sustainability of specific feed formulations can be evaluated and improved, subject to cost and nutritional constraints. Towards this end, published research addressing three sub-topics were reviewed: LCA of feed inputs, goal programming, and feed formulation. Integration of sustainability considerations into feed formulation must take four essential aspects into account, including: individual feed ingredients (as decision variables); total cost of ingredients; their associated, regionally specific life cycle environmental impacts (as objective functions); and the nutritional requirements of laying hens (as nutrient constraints). A framework for regionalized, life cycle-based sustainable feed formulation using weighted goal programming is proposed. Key improvement opportunities including integration of regionalized feed input supply chain models and impact assessment methods, and development of improved weighting methods to reconcile economic and environmental goals were identified and discussed.

AB  - Family businesses are of particular economic relevance in the international hospitality and tourism industry. However, there are few studies that address their specific characteristics and objectives. The aim of this study is to produce a bibliometric overview that reveals the structure underpinning the analysis of the tourism family business in the business and management research field. The study also reveals the evolution of this research over time, as well as the most relevant related concepts and study gaps. Through a keyword co-occurrence analysis and a systematic review of 129 studies on tourism family businesses published between 1997 and 2020, the main contributions were organized into four thematic clusters, which include specific theoretical approaches. The clusters are Entrepreneurship, Marketing Orientation and Innovation Performance; Capabilities and Competitiveness; Sustainability; and Strategy and Economic Performance. On the basis of these results, this study introduces an integrative framework for tourism family business research, clarifying the rich diversity of research paths that seek to explain tourism business competitiveness, and identifying potential directions for future research aimed at further developing the field.

AB  - Trafficking is a global human rights violation with multiple and complex mental health consequences. Valid and reliable mental health assessment tools are needed to inform health-care provision. We reviewed mental health assessment tools used in research with men and women trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. We searched nine electronic databases (PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Embase, Assia, the Web of Science, Global Health, Google Scholar, and Open Grey) and hand-searched the reference lists of relevant identified studies. Seven studies were included in this Review. Six of the studies screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety; one study screened for harmful use or abuse of alcohol and used a diagnostic tool to assess post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Two studies included men in their sample population. Although the reported prevalence of mental health problems was high, little information was provided about the validity, reliability, and cultural appropriateness of assessment tools. Further research is needed to determine which assessment tools are culturally appropriate, valid, and reliable for trafficked people.

AB  - Background: The objective was to develop high-quality and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines on the diagnosis and management of lung cancer.
   Methods: A carefully crafted panel of lung cancer experts, methodologists, and other specialists was assembled and reviewed for relevant conflicts of interest. The American College of Chest Physicians guideline methodology was used. Population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO)-based key questions and defined criteria for eligible studies were developed to inform the search strategies, subsequent evidence summaries, and recommendations. Research studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, where they existed, were assessed for quality and summarized to inform the recommendations.
   Results: Each recommendation was developed with supporting evidence and the consensus of the writing committees. Controversial recommendations were identified for further consultation by the entire panel, with anonymous voting to achieve consensus.
   Conclusions: The final recommendations can be trusted by health-care providers, patients, and other stakeholders since they are based on the current evidence in these areas and were developed with trustworthy processes for guideline development.

AB  - Learning has been put forward as a critical aspect to achieve sustainable transformation of so-cietal systems. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of empirical evidence on how learning is related to sustainability transitions. To bridge this gap, we systematically reviewed 113 empirical papers that addressed the role of learning in transitions. Our results show that the complexity of the relationship between learning and transitions is not deeply analysed and that there is a need to distinguish more precisely between learning processes and learning outcomes. Further, there is a need to shift the focus towards analysing regime-level learning to increase our understanding of how learning contributes to system transformation. Finally, networks, trust, disagreement, and power are key aspects related to learning that will require further examination, especially in terms of how they play out dynamically in learning for sustainability transitions.

AB  - Given the growing costs in the healthcare supply chain management, optimising the healthcare supply chain configuration, accurate demand forecast and efficient distribution of products, and increasing the efficiency of processes and operations in healthcare organisations via deployment of innovative ideas and technologies are critical to maintain a sustainable healthcare supply chain system. A descriptive review approach is used to systematically study the different echelons in a typical healthcare supply chain system and provide insight into understanding of its structural characteristics that makes it different from manufacturing supply chain network. Particularly, the structure of healthcare supply chain networks, the goal of a healthcare supply chain system, complexities associated with healthcare products, criticality of reliable product transportation, and complex dynamics in physician-hospital-vendor loop are studied. Better understanding of the differences between manufacturing and healthcare supply chain management can provide a guideline to systematically improve healthcare supply chain management.

AB  - Viral hepatitis is one of the major public health concerns around the world but until recently it has drawn little attention or funding from global health policymakers. Every year 1.4 million people die from viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis and liver cancer. However, the majority of the infected population are unaware of their condition. This population have significant obstacles to overcome such as lack of awareness, vulnerability, increased migration, disease stigma, discrimination, as well as poor health resources, conflict in policy development and program implementation. Despite implementing infection control measures over the last few decades eradication or significant disease reduction remains elusive. This study aims to present the current global prevalence status and examines potential elimination strategies. The information for this research were obtained through a systematic review, published scientific literatures, the official websites of various government organisations, international public health organisations and internationally recognised regulatory bodies over a period of 40 years between 1978 and 2018.

AB  - A mission statement is a widely used strategic tool that emphasises an organisation's uniqueness and identity. It was in the early 1980s that academics, managers, and consultants recognised the need for explicitly formulating a mission statement in organisations. Since then, mission statements have remained as a popular strategic tool in organisations. This article conducts a systematic literature review to synthesise research on mission statements. The analysis of the 53 articles selected includes a bibliometric and content analysis. According to their perspective, the works selected were grouped into four thematic areas: (1) mission statement development, (2) mission statement components, (3) mission impact on employees, and (4) mission impact on performance. The overreaching conclusion is that mission statements are widely used in practice but poorly researched in theory. Most articles adopt a managerial phenomenon-based strand, lacking a deep theoretical foundation. The article ends with suggestions for further research in terms of theory, practice, and methodology.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important legume for human consumption worldwide and an important source of vegetable protein, minerals, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds. The N-2-fixation capacity of this crop reduces its demand for synthetic N fertilizer application to increase yield and quality. Fertilization, yield, and quality of common bean may be optimised by several other agronomic practices such as irrigation, rhizobia application, sowing density, etc. Taking this into consideration, a systematic review integrated with a bibliometric analysis of several agronomic practices that increase common bean yield and quality was conducted, based on the literature published during 1971-2021. A total of 250 publications were found dealing with breeding (n = 61), sowing density and season (n = 14), irrigation (n = 36), fertilization (n = 27), intercropping (n = 12), soilless culture (n = 5), tillage (n = 7), rhizobia application (n = 36), biostimulant/biofertilizer application (n = 21), disease management (n = 15), pest management (n = 2) and weed management (n = 14). The leading research production sites were Asia and South America, whereas from the Australian continent, only four papers were identified as relevant. The keyword co-occurrence network analyses revealed that the main topics addressed in relation to common bean yield in the scientific literature related to that of "pod", "grain", "growth", "cultivar" and "genotype", followed by "soil", "nitrogen", "inoculation", "rhizobia", "environment", and "irrigation". Limited international collaboration among scientists was found, and most reported research was from Brazil. Moreover, there is a complete lack in interdisciplinary interactions. Breeding for increased yield and selection of genotypes adapted to semi-arid environmental conditions combined with the suitable sowing densities are important agronomic practices affecting productivity of common bean. Application of fertilizers and irrigation practices adjusted to the needs of the plants according to the developmental stage and selection of the appropriate tillage system are also of high importance to increase common bean yield and yield qualities. Reducing N-fertilization via improved N-fixation through rhizobia inoculation and/or biostimulants application appeared as a main consideration to optimise crop performance and sustainable management of this crop. Disease and weed management practices appear neglected areas of research attention, including integrated pest management.

AB  - Previous blue carbon studies have focused on discrete carbon stock assessments and overarching systematic reviews which broadly speculate that it may be economically viable to incorporate mangroves into existing carbon finance platforms. There is a discernible need to test this hypothesis through case specific investigations that determine this presumed viability in a local or regional context - at scales meaningful for policy development. The current study investigates whether the carbon values of mangrove forests on Panay Island, the Philippines, are sufficient to offset the opportunity costs of milkfish (Charms charms) aquaculture - the primary cause of mangrove deforestation in the Philippines. Profit margins associated with milldish aquaculture are calculated through a municipality wide survey (779 +/- 140 US$ ha(-1) yr(-1)). Concurrently, the carbon stocks of two heterogeneous mangrove forests are quantified and compared. Creditable CO2 emissions reductions are modelled under a broad range of assumptions. These emissions are valorised, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to establish the minimum price at which opportunity costs are offset across a range of methodological and accounting preferences. It is determined that carbon prices of around 5-12 US$ LCO(2)e(-1) would be required to compensate landowners for their lost aquaculture profits. The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB  - Water is essential for food security, industrial output, ecological sustainability, and a country's socioeconomic progress. Water scarcity and environmental concerns have increased globally in recent years as a result of the ever-increasing population, rapid industrialization and urbanization, and poor water resource management. Even though there are sufficient water resources, their uneven circulation leads to shortages and the requirement for portable fresh water. More than two billion people live in water-stressed areas. Hence, the present study covers all of the research based on water extraction from atmospheric air, including theoretical and practical (different experimental methods) research. A comparison between different results is made. The calculated efficiency of the systems used to extract water from atmospheric air by simulating the governing equations is discussed. The effects of different limitations, which affect and enhance the collectors' efficiency, are studied. This research article will be very useful to society and will support further research on the extraction of water in arid zones.

AB  - Carnivore and humans live in proximity due to carnivore recovery efforts and ongoing human encroachment into carnivore habitats globally. The American West is a region that uniquely exemplifies these human-carnivore dynamics, however, it is unclear how the research community here integrates social and ecological factors to examine human-carnivore relations. Therefore, strategies promoting human-carnivore coexistence are urgently needed. Weconducted a systematic review on human-carnivore relations in the American West covering studies between 2000 and 2018. Wefirst characterized human-carnivore relations across states of the American West. Second, we analyzed similarities and dissimilarities across states in terms of coexistence, tolerance, number of ecosystem services and conflicts mentioned in literature. Third, we used Bayesian modeling to quantify the effect of social and ecological factors influencing the scientific interest on coexistence, tolerance, ecosystem services and conflicts. Results revealed some underlying biases in humancarnivore relations research. Colorado and Montana were the states where the highest proportion of studies were conducted with bears and wolves the most studied species. Non-lethal management was the most common strategy to mitigate conflicts. Overall, conflicts with carnivores were much more frequently mentioned than benefits. Wefound similarities among Arizona, California, Utah, and New Mexico according to how coexistence, tolerance, services and conflicts are addressed in literature. We identified percentage of federal/private land, carnivore family, social actors, and management actions, as factors explaining how coexistence, tolerance, conflicts and services are addressed in literature. We provide a roadmap to foster tolerance towards carnivores and successful coexistence strategies in the American West based on four main domains, (1) the dual role of carnivores as providers of both beneficial and detrimental contributions to people, (2) social-ecological factors underpinning the provision of beneficial and detrimental contributions, (3) the inclusion of diverse actors, and (4) cross-state collaborative management.

AB  - Education for sustainable development embodies the vital importance of education for achieving sustainable development. However, there are shortcomings in its theoretical foundations, implementation, and implications for educational institutions. Therefore, this review aimed to analyze scientific articles that respond to the term's complexity from the scientific literature perspective in Scopus and Web of Science. A systematic literature review was conducted under PRISMA 2020, systematizing 74 documents. It was concluded that education for sustainable development is deconstructed under different perspectives and characteristics. Likewise, through critical analysis, the importance of higher education institutions and the role they must assume to contribute to sustainability was pointed out. Finally, the barriers and enablers of the implementation of the term under discussion were presented, systematizing these elements and turning them into factors to be considered during the implementation process. The aim is to encourage research that contrasts the theory presented and contributes to the theoretical strengthening of sustainability in HEIs.

AB  - The living lab concept is identified as having the potential to provide a platform to test technologies and support energy transition. However, the application of the concept to the energy sector is limited, though emerging. This study undertook a systematic literature review to understand the extent of the application of the living lab concept, with the particular aim of informing the processes to establish such a platform in urban Africa. Using a sample of 35 papers, only 17 papers were related to energy-living labs, while 18 papers were outside the energy field. The scale and contexts of the application of living labs were diverse. However, not all initiatives that defined themselves as living labs were characterised by elements typical of the concept of a living lab. Further, how the stakeholders were identified, and the stakeholder recruitment process in energy living labs was unclear in the sampled studies. A recommendation is to improve transparency in the stakeholder identification, engagement, and recruitment process in energy living labs and to incorporate gendered issues into the setup and management of urban energy living labs.

AB  - The growing energy demand, together with the depletion of sweet gas reservoirs, impose the monetization of ultra-sour natural gas fields with a high H2S content. To date, in large scale facilities, H2S is removed from natural gas through amine washing and it is converted to sulphur in the Claus process. The Claus process is the leading H2S conversion technology for large scale applications. Regarding small scale plants, scavengers are the most efficient and widely spread choice. On the other hand, present middle scale options show quite high operating costs. Therefore, research efforts are devoted to developing new intermediate scale alternatives with lower costs and easier operability. When developing a new process, the study of the state-of-the-art is the first essential step. No systematic review of H2S valorisation technologies is available in literature. To fill this gap, the aim of this work is to summarize the available processes considering both commercial and novel tendencies for H2S conversion. For each technology, details about process operating conditions are discussed and the typical application is provided, when possible, together with the corresponding pros and cons.

AB  - Many regions of the world are facing mounting water stress as competition increases for this vital resource that may become scarcer under future climates. More water is being allocated to our needs for food, public supply, hydro-electric power and industrial goods to support growing populations and mounting life-style expectations. To achieve this, less water is often being retained for water-dependent ecosystems. Environmental protection agencies and conservation organisations have highlighted the resulting threat to freshwater biodiversity and associated ecosystem services that support human livelihoods and well-being. Careful assessments are therefore required to advise on the optimum allocation of water and to determine the risk of developments that require redistribution of water resources. Along the northern fringes of the Guadalquivir River delta and estuary in southern Spain about 40% of all jobs derive from agriculture. The production of olives, fruit trees, rice and berries is a major component of the local economy producing large exports, but it requires significant water from local rivers and the underlying aquifers. The economy is also reliant on tourism that brings many thousands of people to the area in the summer for which groundwater abstraction is augmented. The delta is the location of the Donana wetland complex of lagoons, marshlands, fixed and mobile dunes that was designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1980, as wetland of international importance (Ramsar Site) under the Convention on Wetlands in 1982 and as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994. Fears have been expressed that increasing human water use is putting the wetlands at risk of drying out, despite efforts by the river basin authority to limit abstraction to sustainable levels. This paper reports on a methodology that analyses best available eco-hydrological scientific knowledge together with information on the likely success of abstraction control measures to determine the risk to the wetland ecosystem of current and future planned water allocation. The method was applied to Donana by the joint UNESCO/IUCN/Ramsar Reactive Monitoring mission to in 2020. The results are also provided in the paper, which raised many important scientific and related political, legal and social issues concerning the impacts of water withdrawals on the ecology of the wetlands. The methodology has wide application to environmental water allocation assessments.

AB  - Neoteric studies have called attention to the prominence of management in healthcare sectors. Positive relationship have been noticed between performance management, clinical performance, and clinical outcome. However, there is still debate related to which managers have to lead healthcare organizations, and what kind of management should be followed, we are now about to analyze. Systematic review of the literature is a starting point to present and discuss the current of information concerning with how management can affect the quality and perpetuity of health systems. Through in-depth analysis of 27 studies, we concluded that the performance of healthcare systems and organizations positively consistent with leadership, management practices, manager characteristics, and cultural features that are related to values and administrative approaches. There was also testimony that doctors who lead healthcare organizations show excellence in performance better than others. Finally, this review acting as roadmap which indicating how do the relationship between the management and performance of healthcare systems, and organizations can be furtherly investigated.

AB  - In comparison to terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, much remains unknown about the deep sea's ecosystems and their economic value. This is of concern on at least three fronts. First, the deep sea forms the majority of the ocean's marine systems and contributes substantially to global fish stocks (Danovaro et al., 2017; Drazen and Sutton, 2017). Second, it is essential for the functioning of global biogeochemical cycles, and underpins the sustenance of terrestrial ecosystems and human life (Armstrong et al., 2012). Third, the deep sea faces increased pressure from human activity in the form of deep-sea mining (DSM) (The World Bank, 2016). Based upon lessons drawn from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in Marine Policy (Folkersen et al., 2018), this letter discusses four main directions for future research into economic valuation, policymaking and legislation pertaining to the deep sea. First, the valuation perspective adopted for policy and decision-making on deep-sea resources needs to be defined clearly. Second, strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) and environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of DSM activities need to examine the potential global environmental damage from DSM, rather than examine impacts restricted to the geographical site in which mining takes place. Third, the interdependence between anthropogenic behaviour and economic value generated by the deep sea requires further investigation. Fourth, in addition to the valuation of specific ecosystem goods and services, the ecosystem functioning of the deep sea should also be valued. Improving our understanding of the value that the deep sea provides to human societies can facilitate sustainable resource-use, effective environmental management, and prevent severe and irreversible damage to the deep sea's ecosystems.

AB  - types. Among these mobil oil has major application in automobiles and different machines. The combustion of mobil oil renders a non-usable form that ultimately enters the environment thereby causing problems to environmental health. The aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon fraction of mobil oil has serious human and environmental health hazards. These components upon interaction with soil affect its fertility and microbial diversity. The recent advancement in the omics approach viz. metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics has led to increased efficiency for the use of microbial based remediation strategy. Additionally, the use of biosurfactants further aids in increasing the bioavailability and thus biodegradation of crude oil constituents. The combination of more than one approach could serve as an effective tool for efficient reduction of oil contamination from diverse ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge only a few publications on mobil oil have been published in the last decade. This systematic review could be extremely useful in designing a micro-bioremediation strategy for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems contaminated with mobil oil or petroleum hydrocarbons that is both efficient and feasible.

AB  - Using a dataset of 2,229 scholarly outputs from the Web of Science on the sharing economy (SE), our scientometric review provides a taxonomy of the current research on the SE in terms of their contributions, theories, and methods utilized in existing studies. The review also highlights a typology of the inter-related concepts of the SE. We demonstrate four clusters of existing research: freelance work and its implications, transportation and solutions for the sustainable development of the SE, user experience and collaborative consumption, and the SE in the context of hospitality and tourism. We suggest future research directions in terms of the need to investigate the SE implications on a wider set of stakeholders including businesses and governments, to examine the SE value creation in terms of business models and entrepreneurship, to investigate the SE in other industries and sectors, and to conduct large-scale empirical studies in this research domain.

AB  - Microbial abundance and diversity in river ecosystems are being increasingly investigated, yet a synthesized understanding is still lacking. Here, studies of microbial abundance and diversity along global rivers are systematically reviewed based on 814 investigations performed across 8376 sites. We found that riverine microbial investigations are extremely heterogeneous regarding the spatiotemporal distribution of the sampling sites, the environmental media concerned, the microbial groups and indices targeted, the methods used, and the physicochemical properties examined. More than 72.23% of the studies were performed in the last 8 years, with most studies conducted in Europe, China, and the United States, while other regions were poorly investigated. Most studies have examined microbes in water, but very few studies have systematically investigated microbes in water, sediments, and riparian soils. Bacteria are the most studied microbial taxonomic groups; microbes with resistance genes and nitrogen cycling genes are the most studied microbial functional groups. High-throughput sequencing has greatly expanded our understanding of microbial diversity along rivers. Nevertheless, the ecological implications of microbial diversity are still poorly understood. Regarding physicochemical properties, researchers tend to examine environmental parameters that are critical for shaping microbial communities, such as pH, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Future research should pay more attention to rivers that have not been well studied, especially large rivers. Additionally, microbial studies along rivers should be conducted in a more systematic way, taking the underinvestigated environmental media, microbial groups, microbial indices, and physicochemical properties into consideration. Advanced microbiology techniques, such as multiple omics technologies, should be increasingly applied.

AB  - Background. Cystic echinococcosis is considered a public health problem that if left untreated can have dangerous consequences for the person. The disease is caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato larvae. The main risk factors for this parasitic infection are habitat, direct contact with dogs, use of raw vegetables, and use of unwashed vegetables. The most important factors affecting the prevalence of HCD are economic, occupational, agricultural, educational, and factors related to public health and cultural habits of the general public in that geographical area. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the types of cystic echinococcosis genotypes (E. granulosus sensu stricto (G(1)-G(3)) and E. Canadensis (G(6) and G(7))) in livestock in Iran. Method. This systematic review was conducted, using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar databases, to identify studies of cystic echinococcosis in animals published from 2010 to April 14, 2021. Finally, 28 studies were selected for meta-analysis, which was analyzed using Stata software version 14. The cystic echinococcosis prevalence with 95% confidence intervals of animals was synthesized using the random effect model. Heterogeneity was evaluated and in cases where the I-2 index was higher than 75%, subgroup analysis was performed according to the types of animals. Result. The highest prevalence of cystic echinococcosis infection was related to G(1) genotype (P=0.91 (95% CI=0.84,0.97)) and the prevalence was related to G(2) genotype (P=0.07(95% CI=0.00,0.18)). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that in the G(1) genotype the highest prevalence was observed in Goats and Buffaloes with P=1 (95% CI=0.96,1) and P=1 (95% CI=0.97,1), in the G(3) and G(6) genotypes the highest prevalence was observed in camels with P=0.50 (95% CI=0.31,0.69), and P=0.45 (95% CI=0.22,0.69), respectively. Conclusion. The cystic echinococcosis genotypes vary from region to region or from country to country and also from host to host, and according to the results, it should always be stopped in areas where the prevalence of such genomes suitable for livestock as well as human food sources to prevent infection of livestock and thus human exposure to cystic echinococcosis.

AB  - The number of motorcycle taxis has soared in East African cities over the last decades, filling a gap in mobility needs while providing revenue opportunities to drivers. However, poor road safety combined with contribution to carbon emissions and air pollution creates a sustainability conundrum, which has led governments to control or repress the mode, yet without much success. After reviewing the characteristics and regulation of motorcycle taxis in Nairobi, Kigali, and Kampala, this study investigates the existence and impacts of two recent trends: digitalization and electrification. A comprehensive approach is adopted with a systematic review of the literature and policies, completed by field research and key informant interviews. We find out that electrification is mostly associated with positive impacts covering a spectrum of environment, economics, health, and social-related benefits, while the benefits of digitalization are more uncertain or contested. Impacts are however limited for both at the time of study as digitalization is highly volatile and electrification nascent. In conclusion, the paper identifies an interlinkage between the trends via the example of data, and further key research needs.

AB  - Humanity is struggling against a major problem for a proper management of generated municipal solid waste. The collected waste causes natural issues like uncontrollable emission of greenhouse gases and others. Even though, escalation of waste results in minimizing the areas accessible for disposing the waste. Creating awareness in the society to use organic products like biofuels, biofertilizers and biogas is a need of an hour. Biochemical processes such as composting, vermicomposting, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling play important role in valorizing biomass and solid waste for production of biofuels, biosurfactants and biopolymer. This paper covers the details of biomass and solid waste characteristics and its composition. It is also focused to provide updated information about reutilization of biomass for value creation. Technologies and products obtained through bioroutes are discussed in current review paper together with the integrated system of solid waste management. It also covers challenges, innovations and perspectives in this field.

AB  - Large floodplain rivers (LFRs) are currently threatened by high levels of human alteration, and utilization is expected to grow. Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important. Empirical research in this field can aid in solving conflicts between socio-economic demands for ecosystem services and nature conservation of LFRs.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska;n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11-25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6-10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments.

AB  - Ecosystem services provide regulation, provisioning, support, and cultural benefits for human survival, but it needs to be clarified how the trade-off/synergy relationships can be used to optimize function. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, we collected 254 articles on the ecosystem trade-offs/synergies and functional optimization. Through a systematic review of the literature, this paper summarized the research progress and landmark achievements from three aspects: trade-offs/synergies, functional optimization, and evaluation methods. The results indicated the following: (1) In terms of the number of articles published, there were no reports before 2005; from 2006 to 2022, the annual number of published papers increased from 1 to 72, showing an overall growth trend year by year. This mainly includes three stages: initial (1970-2005), slow development (2005-2014), and rapid development (2014-2022). (2) In terms of research areas, focus was placed mainly on Asia, North America, and Europe, accounting for 40.47%, 25.55%, and 15.07% of all regions, respectively. (3) In the future, it is necessary to focus on scientific issues such as the improvement of forest ecosystem functions, the trade-off/synergy relationships between services, the scale of spatiotemporal research, and the driving factors and evaluation methods for the management of rocky karst desertification. The aim is to provide a theoretical basis to optimize the forest ecosystem service functions.

AB  - Populations of bears in Asia are vulnerable to extinction and effective monitoring is critical to measure and direct conservation efforts. Population abundance (local density) or growth (lambda) are the most sensitive metrics to change. We discuss the value in implementing spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR), the current gold standard for density estimation, and open population SCR (OPSCR) to monitor changes in density over time. We provide guidance for designing studies to provide estimates with sufficient power to detect changes. Because of the wide availability of camera traps and interest in their use, we consider six density estimation methods and their extensions developed for use with camera traps, with specific consideration of assumptions and applications for monitoring Asian bears. We conducted a power analysis to calculate the precision in estimates needed to detect changes in populations with reference to IUCN Red List criteria. We performed a systematic review of empirical studies implementing camera trap abundance estimation methods and considered sample sizes, effort, and model assumptions required to achieve adequate precision for population monitoring. We found SCR and OPSCR, reliant on "marked" individuals, are currently the only methods with enough power to reliably detect even moderate to major (20-80%) declines. Camera trap methods with unmarked individuals rarely achieved precision sufficient to detect even large declines (80-90%), although with some exceptions (e.g., situations with moderate population densities, large number of sampling sites, or inclusion of ancillary local telemetry data. We describe additional estimation options including line transects, direct observations, monitoring age-specific survival and reproductive rates, and hybrid/integrated methodologies that may have potential to work for some Asian bear populations. We conclude monitoring changes in abundance or density is possible for most Asian bear populations but will require collaboration among researchers over broad spatial extents and extensive financial investment to overcome biological and logistical constraints. We strongly encourage practitioners to consider study design and sampling effort required to meet objectives by conducting simulations, power analyses, and assumption checks prior to implementing monitoring efforts, and reporting standardized dispersion measures such as coefficients of variation to allow for assessment of precision. Our guidance is relevant to other low-density and wide-ranging species.

AB  - Despite the increased attention, which has been given to the issue of involving knowledge and experts from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) into the products and works of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), little is known on what the expectations towards the involvement of SSH in IPBES actually are. The aim of this paper is to close this gap by identifying the range of possible SSH contributions to IPBES that are expected in the literature, and discuss the inherent challenges of and concrete ways to realize these contributions in the particular institutional setting of IPBES. We address these two points by: firstly, assessing the literature dealing with IPBES and building a typology describing the main ways in which contributions from SSH to IPBES have been conceived between 2006 and 2017. We discuss these expected contributions in light of broader debates on the role of SSH in nature conservation and analyse some of the blind spots and selectivities in the perception of how SSH could substantially contribute to the works of IPBES. Then, secondly, by looking at one particular example, economics and its use in the first thematic assessment on pollinators, pollination and food production, we will concretely illustrate how works in a given discipline could contribute in many different and unprecedented ways to the works of IPBES and help identify paths for enhancing the conservation of biodiversity. Finally, we propose a range of practical recommendations as to how to increase the contribution of SSH in the works of IPBES.

AB  - Heat has become a central concern for cities everywhere, but heat governance has historically lagged behind other climate change hazards. This study examines 175 municipal plans from the 50 most populous cities in the United States to understand which aspects of urban heat are included or not in city plans and what factors explain inclusion. We find that a majority of plans mention heat, but few include strategies to address it and even fewer cite sources of information. The term 'extreme heat event' (EHE) is significantly more likely to be paired with institutional actions as a part of hazard planning, while 'urban heat island' (UHI) is more likely to be paired with green and grey infrastructure interventions as a part of general planning. Disparity and thermal comfort framings are not significantly related to any solutions and are used least. Plan type, followed by environmental networks (e.g. C40, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities), explain variation in plan content; social and environmental context do not. Findings point to the emergence of two independent heat governance systems, EHE and UHI, and several gaps in heat planning: integration, specificity, solutions, disparity, economy, and thermal comfort.

AB  - In an increasingly interconnected world, human-environment interactions involving flows of people, organisms, goods, information, and energy are expanding in magnitude and extent, often over long distances. As a universal paradigm for examining these interactions, the telecoupling framework (published in 2013) has been broadly implemented across the world by researchers from diverse disciplines. We conducted a systematic review of the first five years of telecoupling research to evaluate the state of telecoupling science and identify strengths, areas to be improved, and promising avenues for future study. We identified 89 studies using any derivation of the term telecoupling. These works emphasize trade flows, information transfer, and species dispersal at international, national, and regional scales involving one or a few countries, with China, Brazil, and the United States being the most frequently studied countries. Our review showed a rising trend in publications and citations on telecoupling, with 63% of identified telecoupling studies using the framework's specific language (e.g., flows, agents). This result suggests that future telecoupling studies could apply the standardized telecoupling language and terminology to better coordinate, synthesize, and operationalize interdisciplinary research. Compelling topics for future research include operationalization of the telecoupling framework, commonalities among telecouplings, telecoupling mechanisms and causality, and telecoupled systems governance. Overall, the first five years of telecoupling research have improved our understanding of human-environment interactions, laying a promising foundation for future social-ecological research in a telecoupled world.

AB  - Land abandonment is a process widespread in many regions of the world as a consequence of socio-economic conditions and changes on the use of land. Research has shown that land abandonment can have both posi-tive and negative effects, depending on the local context, location and scale. Research has framed land aban-donment either as an opportunity for rewilding these landscapes or as a loss of cultural values. Here, we present a literature review of the effects of land abandonment on social and ecological dimensions in the Mediterranean region, an area where is a common phenomenon. The results show that land abandonment is widely studied throughout the Northern Mediterranean, in particular in Spain, Italy and France, while no studies has been performed in the Southern part, such as in Morocco or Tunisia. Most of the land abandonment outcomes iden-tified were negative, followed by mixed outcomes (being partly positive and negative). Abandonment studies focused more often on outcomes on nature's contributions to people (such as biodiversity and habitat for spe-cies), while studies on the effects on the social dimension through the consideration of good quality of life components are scarce. The results highlight the high diversity of effects and outcomes derived from land abandonment. We call for research focusing on how the comprehensive process of land abandonment can impact and promote key changes in the future. Further research should pay greater attention to North African and Middle East countries in the Mediterranean region, where multiple pathways of abandonment are currently emerging, as well as the consideration of the social dimension of the effects of land abandonment to capture the full complexity of this land use change.

AB  - What is the impact of sustainability certification on food security in developing countries? This article explores the issue through a systematic review of the extant scholarship, complemented by a selective review of key studies examining the wider socio-economic effects of certification that may affect food security indirectly. To guide the analysis, we identify three main causal mechanisms - economic, land use and land rights, and gender effects - that link certification to local food security. Our review finds that food security remains a blind spot in the literature on certification impacts. Existing research points to a positive, albeit weak and highly contextdependent, relationship between certification, farmers' income, and food security. However, there is only indicative evidence about the relationships that link certification to food security via its influence on land use, land rights, and gender equality.

AB  - Various scholars and research institutions have attempted to assess High Conservation Values (HCVs) using different methodologies and approaches. Various countries have developed toolkits to determine High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) according to their needs and conservation strategies but there is no global agreement on them. The present study attempts to review research papers and assessment reports from 1999 until 2018 on approaches and methodologies used for HCVs all over the world and provide a review into HCV research systematically, with due consideration to the linkages between Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Socio-Economic-Cultural values. We analyzed and examined the trends which are emerging and gaps present in HCV assessments evident from literature reviewed by experts, including the spatial spread of research, the evolving use and content of the concept, and consultation with stakeholders. A total, 80 articles were taken from Scopus and various reputed journals and reports using keywords like HCV and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to specifically focus on the application and evolution of the concept designed by FSC. The study was done in the hope to help in analyzing different HCV components as a conservation planning tool and guide new research in methodologies to fill the current gaps and enhance HCV assessments at different levels of application. The review result revealed that the HCV approach is an effective tool for delineating the conservation priority areas and reduce the uncontrolled extraction of natural resources. The findings display the focus area in HCV research that are surveying methods, fields of application and the dynamics between social and environmental components of HCV categories.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly put into use to address cities' economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges. Thanks to its advanced capabilities, AI is set to become one of local governments' principal means of achieving smart and sustainable development. AI utilisation for urban planning, nonetheless, is a relatively understudied area of research, particularly in terms of the gap between theory and practice. This study presents a comprehensive review of the areas of urban planning in which AI technologies are contemplated or applied, and it is analysed how AI technologies support or could potentially support smart and sustainable development. Regarding the methodological approach, this is a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. The obtained insights include: (a) Early adopters' real-world AI applications in urban planning are paving the way to wider local government AI adoption; (b) Achieving wider AI adoption for urban planning involves collaboration and partnership between key stakeholders; (c) Big data is an integral element for effective AI utilisation in urban planning, and; (d) Convergence of artificial and human intelligence is crucial to address urbanisation issues adequately and to achieve smart and sustainable development. These insights highlight the importance of making planning smarter through advanced data and analytical methods.

AB  - Sand mining (used here as a generic term that includes mining of any riverine aggregates regardless of particle size) is a global activity that is receiving increasing media attention due to perceived negative environmental and social impacts. As calls grow for stronger regulation of mining, there is a need to understand the scientific evidence to support effective management. This paper summarizes the results of a structured literature review addressing the question, "What evidence is there of impacts of sand mining on ecosystem structure, process, and biodiversity in rivers, floodplains, and estuaries?" The review found that most investigations have focused on temperate rivers where sand mining occurred historically but has now ceased. Channel incision was the most common physical impact identified; other physical responses, including habitat disturbance, alteration of riparian zones, and changes to downstream sediment transport, were highly variable and dependant on river characteristics. Ecosystem attributes affected included macroinvertebrate drift, fish movements, species abundance and community structures, and food web dynamics. Studies often inferred impacts on populations, but supporting data were scarce. Limited evidence suggests that rivers can sustain extraction if volumes are within the natural sediment load variability. Significantly, the countries and rivers for which there is science-based evidence related to sand mining are not those where extensive sand mining is currently reported. The lack of scientific and systematic studies of sand mining in these countries prevents accurate quantification of mined volumes or the type, extent, and magnitude of any impacts. Additional research into how sand mining is affecting ecosystem services, impacting biodiversity and particularly threatened species, and how mining impacts interact with other activities or threats is urgently required.

AB  - In this paper, a systematic literature review on the impact of fisheries on the economy and the application of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) and input-output (IO) methods for assessing this impact is conducted. The importance of fisheries as a food source, the over exploitation of this resource, and, consequently, the impact of fisheries on the economy are the motivations behind this study. By reviewing the applications of two of the most common economic modelling tools, we aim to shine light on the state of the art and how the impact of fisheries on the economy has been addressed in the literature. In this analysis, three main themes of socio-economic, ecological, and environmental have been identified, and the application of these methods in each theme has been considered. The results show that while IO methods continue to be applied in the literature, the CGE method has experienced increased application recently, and future applications are anticipated due to its enhanced capabilities in comparison with IO models.

AB  - ContextConsideration of human-environment dimensions of wildfire make ecosystem services (ES) a useful framework for understanding wildfire challenges and devising viable management strategies. Scientific literature on wildfire and ES is growing rapidly, but connections are disparate and evolving.ObjectivesWe review relationships between mountain wildfire and a comprehensive list of 50 relevant ES informed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Our conceptual framework is used to evaluate underlying mechanisms and the direction and scale of wildfire impacts on ES.MethodsWe focus the review on the Colorado Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, one of the best-studied landscapes in the world for understanding fire-ES relationships and evaluating how regional differences contribute to broader understanding of ES globally. We begin our review by considering key relationships, followed by a structured literature search of wildfire impacts with tabulated trends and findings.ResultsKey findings from the review: (1) current fire regimes mostly have negative impacts on ES, with some positive effects on cultural services, (2) changes to vegetation composition and structure are the most common mechanism, (3) mechanisms acting at local and landscape scales impact ES at broader scales, (4) intermediate services warrant attention and management resources, and (5) regional differences may provide opportunities for stronger global synthesis.ConclusionsFamiliarity with landscape legacies, current land use practices, and stakeholder values uniquely positions landscape ecologists to contribute to future studies of wildfire-ES connections. A framework that considers the complete suite of ES can guide researchers to seek collaborations that more completely characterize their regions.

AB  - Biodiversity offsetting is used in diverse policy contexts to reduce, halt or reverse losses of biodiversity arising from development or other uses of the natural environment. Despite increasing interest in the concept of biodiversity offsetting, relatively little attention has been devoted to investigating its use in marine environments. This paper presents a systematic review of documents evidencing the application or inclusion of biodiversity offset principles in policy frameworks concerning the marine environment, and in marine development projects. Biodiversity offsetting policies applicable to marine environments were found to exist in six countries (US, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Colombia) and have been actively considered in at least 27 others. Outside of these, a wide range of other approaches promoting uptake of biodiversity offsetting principles in a marine context were identified. These range from preliminary studies to identify potential compensatory habitat, to nascent biodiversity markets, and project-level application of corporate standards of no net loss. Evidence suggests that where offsetting policy is developed for specific marine application, the preferred approach is to pool financial contributions from developers into funds for strategic action for biodiversity benefit.

AB  - The cruise shipping industry has existed for centuries. However, sustainability is a relatively new trend that could make a big difference and someday impact the industry. A growing body of research on sustainable cruise tourism includes studying changes among industry stakeholders, internal and external processes, and more. However, until now, there have been no comprehensive and systematic reviews of the academic literature on this topic and proposals for future research areas. The sample for our research consists of 56 articles structured into the following themes and subthemes: (1) corporate social responsibility (public interaction and emissions management); (2) territory management (collaboration with stakeholders and infrastructure development); (3) training in sustainable behavior (passengers, ship personnel, and other stakeholders). These themes fully explore the various use cases for sustainable cruises, forming a conceptual framework for understanding trends for the industry's sustainable development. We direct the attention of other researchers to the following areas for further research: GHG emissions of cruising; biodiversity impacts; quantitative understanding of the target audience and their participation in sustainability financing; in-depth understanding of the reasons for cooperation between stakeholders; identifying the true motivation for participation in sustainable development; the long-term trends; and how the shipping industry is adapting to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The ability of vegetated coastal ecosystems to sequester high rates of "blue" carbon over millennial time scales has attracted the interest of national and international policy makers as a tool for climate change mitigation. Whereas focus on blue carbon conservation has been mostly on threatened rural seascapes, there is scope to consider blue carbon dynamics along highly fragmented and developed urban coastlines. The tropical city state of Singapore is used as a case study of urban blue carbon knowledge generation, how blue carbon changes over time with urban development, and how such knowledge can be integrated into urban planning alongside municipal and national climate change obligations. A systematic review of blue carbon studies in Singapore was used to support a qualitative review of Singapore's blue carbon ecosystems, carbon budget, changes through time and urban planning and policy. Habitat loss across all blue carbon ecosystems is coarsely estimated to have resulted in the release of similar to 12.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since the beginning of the 20th century. However, Singapore's remaining blue carbon ecosystems still store an estimated 568,971 - 577,227 tonnes of carbon (equivalent to 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) nationally, with a small proportion of initial loss offset by habitat restoration. Carbon is now a key topic on the urban development and planning agenda, as well as nationally through Singapore's contributions to the Paris Agreement. The experiences of Singapore show that coastal ecosystems and their blue carbon stocks can be successfully managed along an urban coastline, and can help inform blue carbon science and management along other rapidly urbanizing coastlines throughout the tropics.

AB  - In the light of growing concern over the sustainability of the agricultural system, the sustainability of input-intensive agricultural systems becomes questionable due to severe environmental challenges associated with it, for instance, overexploitation of natural resources, deteriorating biodiversity, adverse impact on human health. These challenges have led to increased awareness and a need to switch from input-intensive agriculture to sustainable agriculture. The sustainability of agricultural systems can be improved by adopting various sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) like crop rotation, intercropping, organic farming, integrated pest management, zero tillage. However, the adoption rate of these practices is meager due to various factors. Hence, the present study aims to review the literature from the world to determine the critical factors in adopting SAPs and accordingly explore the potential implications for the Indian context. The study applies the vote-counting method to synthesize evidence-based 30 studies from 18 countries, focusing on developing nations. The findings suggest that the rate of adoption depends on a range of factors: socio-economic, biophysical, institutional, financial, technical, and psychological, but the rate of adoption is low. Thus, it is imperative to understand these essential factors comprehensively for successful future adoption strategies.

AB  - Background: Nursing process (NP) is a standard method of ensuring individualized holistic care through systematic assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention and evaluation of patients. Its standard implementation is mandatory to meet the health target of "ensuring universal quality health-care services" in the sustainable development goals (SDG) launched by World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015. Being a member state of WHO, Ethiopia endorsed the SDG agenda. Therefore, determining the recent pooled estimate and associated factors of NP implementation during patient care would be of greatest importance to improve the quality of nursing care in the country.
   Methods: Primary studies were systematically searched from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PsycINFO and CINAHL data bases using different search operators. Each selected primary study was critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool for prevalence studies. I-2 and Q statistics wereused to investigate heterogeneity. Given the substantial heterogeneity between the studies, random effects meta-analysismodel was used to estimate the pooled magnitude of NP implementation. Subgroup analyses were performed for evidence of heterogeneity. Egger's test was considered to declare publication bias objectively. The PRISMA guideline was followed to report the results.
   Results: A total of 17 primary studies with a sample of 2,819 nurses were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of NP implementation in Ethiopia was 50.22% (95% CI: 43.39%, 57.06%) with severe statistical heterogeneity (I-2 93.0%, P < 0.001) between the studies. From regional subgroup analysis, NP was least implemented in Tigray region 35.92% (95% CI: 30.86%-40.99%, I2 < 0.001%). Egger's test showed no statistical significance for the presence of publication bias (P = 0.23). Nurses' good knowledge of NP [(Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 13.16: 9.17-17.15], nurses' Bachelor of Science (BSC) and above level of education (AOR 4.16; 2.32-5.99), working in a stressful environment (AOR = 0.10; -0.02-0.22), training access (AOR = 3.30; 1.79-4.82) and accessibility of facility required for NP (AOR = 6.05; 3.56-8.53) were significantly associated with NP implementation at 95 % CI.
   Conclusions: It was found that only half of the nurses in Ethiopia implemented NP during patient care. Fortunately, its associated factors were modifiable. Therefore, the existing national efforts of increasing nurses' knowledge of NP and their level of education, availing facilities required for NP implementation, training access and ensuring non stressful working environment should be reinforced to meet the quality nursing care demand in Ethiopia.

AB  - For the last two decades, the Congolese Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector has been undergoing reforms of its governing structures. A recurrent argument supporting the reforms - predominantly in the 3T ASM sector (i.e. tin, tantalum and tungsten) - is that artisanal mining feeds violence (including sexual violence), conflicts, underdevelopment, and poverty. The reforms have been extensively studied, and academic research in turn has triggered empirical policy and advocacy researches. Researchers have found different outcomes and interpretations of the effectiveness of the reforms. This study consists of a systematic review of the findings gathered from the literature on the changing role of the state in governing 3T mining. It argues that in the study areas (i.e. North-Kivu, South-Kivu and Tanganyika), the challenges faced by the state in governing artisanal mining tend to be similar, complex, and rooted in the mining history of eastern DRC. Recent armed conflicts have only added new layers to existing challenges. In addressing these challenges and given their complexity, the state has succeeded in some areas but has failed in putting in place a coherent `model' for governing the 3T ASM sector.

AB  - Asphalt is widely employed in road construction due to its durability and ability to withstand heavy traffic. However, the disposal of waste polymers has emerged as a significant environmental concern. Recently, researchers have used polymer waste to modify asphalt pavements as a new approach. This approach aims to improve pavement performance and address the environmental concerns of polymer waste. Researchers have demonstrated that incorporating polymeric waste into asphalt mixtures can lead to performance improvements in asphalt pavements, particularly in mitigating common distresses including permanent deformation and thermal and fatigue cracking. The current comprehensive review aims to summarize the recent knowledge on the usage of waste polymers in asphalt mixtures, encompassing their impact on performance properties and mixture design. The review also addresses different types of waste polymers, their potential benefits, challenges, and future research directions. By analyzing various studies, this review offers insights into the feasibility, effectiveness, and limitations of incorporating waste polymers into asphalt mixtures. Ultimately, this contributes to the advancement of sustainable and environmentally friendly road construction practices.

AB  - Local governments have a vital climate change adaptation role. However, major breakdowns in the ability of local governments to mainstream adaptation responses have been widely observed. Using a Systematic Quantitative Literature Review method, we assessed 131 original research articles published 2005-2020 to answer three key questions: What trends are evident in the global literature that explain adaptation mainstreaming efforts in municipal policy and practice? What factors are conceptualized as shaping adaptation mainstreaming in local government? Which elements can be considered key to advancing adaptation mainstreaming in municipal policy and practice?We find two overarching factors affect outcomes - authority to adapt and capacity to adapt. Authority to adapt refers to the authorizing environment - or mandate - from national or sub-national government, or from local government leaders, for adaptation action by a municipal administration. Capacity to adapt refers to access to resources, professional networks, and supportive organizational systems and culture, that enable local government adaptation. We find lack of support from local government elected leaders is the most frequently identified barrier to municipal adaptation. Yet, few empirical studies offer deep insight into the factors that inform and influence leadership support for municipal adaptation. Further, we find local government capacity to adapt is largely treated as a singular capacity, held constant throughout the policy cycle. We find limited exploration of the capacities vital to each stage of the policy cycle and the configuration of factors that support adaptation outcomes. We devise a conceptual framework explaining how issues of authority and capacity can interact and influence each other and what they encompass. Such a framework has broader utility for policy development and importantly for implementation at the local level.Key policy insightsMunicipal adaptation can be strengthened through expanded understanding of, and attention to, the factors that inform local leaders' decisions on adaptation, notably clustered around authority and capacity to adapt.Policymakers are encouraged to actively consider the differing capacities needed to progress adaptation through each stage of the policy cycle.Using an implementation lens to evaluate adaptation practice could support documentation of planning-to-implementation gaps and ways of bridging these gaps for enhanced municipal adaptation outcomes.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are intensely endangered, entailing declines in the biodiversity and ecosystem services. Fire may affect the physicochemical water quality parameters of these environments by transference of ash and toxic substances into water bodies, altering nutrient and oxygen concentrations, temperature or turbidity. However, major knowledge gaps in the impacts of fire on freshwater habitats are prevalent. We conducted a systematic review by searching articles in the Web of Science related to the impacts of fire on the physicochemical water properties of freshwater ecosystems. We quantified the set of physicochemical parameters investigated and provided an overview of fire-mediated alterations. We found 54 articles published between 1976 and 2019, with a significant increase during the last decade. Research was strongly biased towards a few temperate western countries, mostly across North America, Europe and Australia. Lotic systems were considerably more studied than lentic systems. Overall, 57 chemical and 17 physical parameters were evaluated, comprising 304 and 77 cases, respectively. Fire altered 68 % of the cases studied and contingency tables showed that this alteration was proportionally similar between chemical (66 %) and physical (75 %) properties. Nutrient concentration, metal ions, alkalinity, turbidity and temperature were parameters recurrently increased by fire (56 %), whereas oxygen mostly decreased (70 %). Our study demonstrates that fire commonly affects water quality parameters of freshwater ecosystems. Biases and resulting gaps may steer future sampling efforts and promote a broader understanding of the impacts of fire on these environments. Our results may ultimately guide applicable conservation policies for biodiversity and water management strategies of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Liver transplant (LT) recipients are considered a vulnerable population amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, available data have been heterogeneous and scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review identifying English-language articles published in PubMed between November 2019 and 30 May 2021. We aimed to explore three areas: (1) outcome and clinical course; (2) immunological response after COVID-19 in LT recipients; and (3) vaccination response. After systematic selection, 35, 4, and 5 articles, respectively, were considered suitable for each area of analysis. Despite the heterogeneity of the reports included in this study, we found that gastrointestinal symptoms were common in LT recipients. The outcome of the LT population was not per se worse compared to the general population, although careful management of immunosuppressive therapy is required. While a complete therapy discontinuation is not encouraged, caution needs to be taken with use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), favoring tacrolimus (TAC) use. Although data conflicted about acquired immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine immunogenicity appeared to be low, suggesting that the level of surveillance should be kept high in this population.

AB  - Due to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic social distance became a necessary strategy adopted in order to curb the fast-rise of infection. However, this strategy adopted by the government has impacted the socio-economic activities and lives of citizens as such new adaptive measures had to be put in place to cope with the pandemic. Accordingly, this study explores the relationship between the current COVID-19 pandemic on hydropower and energy sector in relation to Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction. This paper employs a systematic review of secondary data grounded from document reports and existing literature to explore the trend of COVID-19 pandemic on hydropower and energy sector in relation to CO2 emission reduction. Findings from this article offer empirical evidence toward the impact of COVID-19 on hydropower and energy sector in relation to CO2 emission decrease during the pandemic. More importantly, findings from this study discuss the relationship of COVID-19 on energy sector, impact of COVID-19 on the hydropower sector in comparison to other renewables, impact of COVID-19 and oil demand, and connection of COVID-19 on CO2 emission reduction during the lockdown. Finally, implications are provided to guide policy makers in making decision toward sustainable energy production and CO2 emission reduction.

AB  - In north western Europe, agricultural systems are generally managed to maximize the potential delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this' distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.

AB  - Habitat change and fragmentation are the primary causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Recent decades have seen a surge of funding, published papers and citations in the field as these threats to biodiversity continue to rise. However, how research directions and agenda are evolving in this field remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the current state of research on habitat fragmentation (due to agriculture, logging, fragmentation, urbanisation and roads) pertaining to two of the most threatened vertebrate groups, reptiles and amphibians. We did so by conducting a global scale review of geographical and taxonomical trends on the habitat fragmentation types, associated sampling methods and response variables. Our analyses revealed a number of biases with existing research efforts being focused on three continents (e.g., North America, Europe and Australia) and a surplus of studies measuring species richness and abundance. However, we saw a shift in research agenda towards studies utilising technological advancements including genetic and spatial data analyses. Our findings suggest important associations between sampling methods and prevalent response variables but not with the types of habitat fragmentation. These research agendas are found homogeneously distributed across all continents. Increased research investment with appropriate sampling techniques is crucial in biodiversity hotpots such as the tropics where unprecedented threats to herpetofauna exist.

AB  - It is commonly accepted that water insecurity, accelerated by climate change, is experienced by women in gender specific ways. Using a rapid review methodology this paper evaluates existing literature (2014-2021) on climate change adaptation in relation to water (SDG6) and gender (SDG5) in urban and peri-urban contexts. By analyzing water, gender, and adaptation literature a thematic mapping of SDG5 was done on the resulting 34 documents. Despite methodological limitations - time constraints, exclusion of gender-sustainable development literature, and narrow inclusion criteria - this paper finds a paucity of research in this space during the time period under study. Most literature focuses on low- and middle-income countries, primarily Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, to the exclusion of South America. Notably, evidence demonstrating interlinkages between SDG5 and climate change adaptations in the WaSH sector and gender sensitive dissemination of disaster warnings is lacking. Adaptation strategies resulting in negative impacts on women undermine SDG5 and maladaptive behaviours related to management of domestic water supply and disaster-risks are particularly concerning in this context. Subsequently, this paper establishes the need for practical research assessing the gendered dimensions of all adaptations, including research demonstrating interlinkages between adaptations, women-specific benefits, and strengthened legislation to promote gender equality and empowerment.

AB  - The special issue Scaling up bioenergy? identifies major policy expectations attached to biofuels production worldwide, and it provides systematic reviews of actual biofuel performance and governance in these areas. Papers address the extent to which policy expectations related to climate change mitigation, energy security, rural livelihoods and risk mitigation have been achieved, and the effectiveness of public and private governance in advancing sector sustainability. Building on these findings, the synthesis paper asks, "What next?" for countries wishing to advance national biofuel programmes as one option for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Among other sine qua nons, the special issue highlights the urgent need to downscale global energy demand, and to stop treating biofuels as an isolated sector. Goldemberg et al. (2018) query several aspects of our approach, from research design, data collection, to our recommendation to apply the "precautionary principle" in research as well as policy making. Unfortunately, Goldemberg et al. (2018) incorrectly portray our main argument. Moreover, they claim bias in our approach and mistakes in our empirical evidence, however, without bringing forward an evenhanded critique of research philosophy, methodology or referencing different empirical literature. We fully stand behind our research philosophy and findings presented.

AB  - To evaluate the quality of available evidence on the effects of environmental noise exposure on sleep a systematic review was conducted. The databases PSYCINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and the TNO Repository were searched for non-laboratory studies on the effects of environmental noise on sleep with measured or predicted noise levels and published in or after the year 2000. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Seventy four studies predominately conducted between 2000 and 2015 were included in the review. A meta-analysis of surveys linking road, rail, and aircraft noise exposure to self-reports of sleep disturbance was conducted. The odds ratio for the percent highly sleep disturbed for a 10 dB increase in Lnight was significant for aircraft (1.94; 95% CI 1.61-2.3), road (2.13; 95% CI 1.82-2.48), and rail (3.06; 95% CI 2.38-3.93) noise when the question referred to noise, but non-significant for aircraft (1.17; 95% CI 0.54-2.53), road (1.09; 95% CI 0.94-1.27), and rail (1.27; 95% CI 0.89-1.81) noise when the question did not refer to noise. A pooled analysis of polysomnographic studies on the acute effects of transportation noise on sleep was also conducted and the unadjusted odds ratio for the probability of awakening for a 10 dBA increase in the indoor Lmax was significant for aircraft (1.35; 95% CI 1.22-1.50), road (1.36; 95% CI 1.19-1.55), and rail (1.35; 95% CI 1.21-1.52) noise. Due to a limited number of studies and the use of different outcome measures, a narrative review only was conducted for motility, cardiac and blood pressure outcomes, and for children's sleep. The effect of wind turbine and hospital noise on sleep was also assessed. Based on the available evidence, transportation noise affects objectively measured sleep physiology and subjectively assessed sleep disturbance in adults. For other outcome measures and noise sources the examined evidence was conflicting or only emerging. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of the evidence was moderate for cortical awakenings and self-reported sleep disturbance (for questions that referred to noise) induced by traffic noise, low for motility measures of traffic noise induced sleep disturbance, and very low for all other noise sources and investigated sleep outcomes.

AB  - This study explores the evolution of wine regulations, trade, and production, with a particular focus on the European Union countries and associated countries. The primary objective is to analyze how historical, regulatory, and economic factors have influenced the wine industry from antiquity to modern times. We assess the administrative role of wine in Roman society, its governance in medieval Europe, and the formation of contemporary regulatory frameworks, such as the EU's Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) system. The study employs a systematic review approach inspired by the PRISMA 2020 statement, incorporating a diverse array of academic journals, historical texts, and statistical data. We use k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze 2020 production data and value comparisons among European wine varieties. This quantitative analysis reveals patterns in production and trade profiles across European countries, highlighting Romania's unique position in the non-PDO segment and its strategic balance of wine production and value. The paper also examines the impact of climate change on viticulture and the industry's response to sustainability challenges. By integrating historical insights with contemporary data, our research provides a comprehensive view of the wine industry's evolution, emphasizing the interplay of government oversight, market dynamics, and environmental considerations in shaping the European wine landscape.

AB  - Intense efforts have focused on ecosystem conservation and restoration (ECR) over the past decades, promoting considerable advances in science and practice in this field. However, the applications of the ecosystem services (ESs) concept are rarely considered in the literature when assessing the success and targets of ECR.The ECR literature was systematically reviewed to analyse the relevance of the ES concept in ECR research published from 2007 to 2019 and to assess how the ES concept is integrated into freshwater ECR.In general, the number of publications focusing on ECR and ESs shows a temporal increase (from 12 to 101 publications, 685 in total). The proportion of publications considering ESs as freshwater ECR targets increased from 33 to 70% until 2019, while the proportion of publications that prioritized ecosystem processes and functions as the target declined from 33 to 16%. Despite the clear upward trend, most studies have focused only on the conceptual framework. In addition, the idea of using market-based approaches for ESs has spread quickly, but it has still not been broadly accepted.The number of academic researchers who have contributed to this research field varies substantially across different countries. A country's economic conditions and the extent of freshwater withdrawal can affect efforts devoted to studies on freshwater ECR and ESs. Some ecosystems, such as rivers and wetlands, have attracted much more attention than others. Although most studies have discussed ESs in general, the provisioning and regulation of ESs are mainly considered in studies that differentiate specific ES categories.Current limitations in applying the ES concept in ECR across different studies suggest that further collaboration is needed among ecologists, practitioners, stakeholders and policy-makers to develop a broad mix of approaches for the best and widest use of the ES concept in protecting and enhancing freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - A central concern about achieving global food security is reconfiguring agri-food systems towards sustainability. However, historically-informed trajectories of agri-food system development remain resistant to a change in direction. Through a systematic literature review, we identify three research domains exploring this phenomenon and six explanations of resistance: embedded nature of technologies, misaligned institutional settings, individual attitudes, political economy factors, infrastructural rigidities, research and innovation priorities. We find ambiguities in the use of the terms lock-in and path-dependency, which often weaken the analysis. We suggest a framing that deals with interdependencies and temporal dynamics of causes of resistance. Finally, we discuss implications for framing innovation for transformational change and other research gaps.

AB  - The worldwide growth of megaprojects has triggered an increasing number of academic publications in the past few decades. However, there are few studies drawing the whole picture of construction megaproject management. This study aims to investigate the status and identify research implications of construction megaproject management by conducting a systematic review. A total of 155 journal articles in 2007-2018 were identified and analysed, mainly using a bibliographic analysis on annual circulation, major journals, research origins, and categories of research interests. Results indicated that IJPM, JME, PMJ, FEM, JCEM, Sustainability, PICE-MPL and ECAM are the major journals, and developed regions/countries such as the United Kingdom rather than developing regions/countries such as mainland China are the dominant contributors in this field. Ten categories of research interests on megaproject management were also displayed and respectively discussed in depth. Moreover, three implications for future research, namely, 'construction megaproject research in developing areas', 'human factors in construction megaproject research' and 'external complexity in construction megaproject research', were proposed. The clear picture of existing literature might provide insights for academic research into megaproject management. Besides, the frontiers of megaproject research could equip practitioners with updated problem-solving strategies and then facilitate faster development in megaproject management.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women globally and represents the second leading cause of cancer death among women (after lung cancer). India is going through epidemiologic transition. It is reported that the incidence of breast cancer is rising rapidly as a result of changes in reproductive risk factors, dietary habits and increasing life expectancy, acting in concert with genetic factors. Materials and Methods: In order to understand the existing epidemiological correlates of breast cancer in South India, a systematic review of evidence available on epidemiologic correlates of breast cancer addressing incidence, prevalence, and associated factors like age, reproductive factors, cultural and religious factors was performed with specific focus on screening procedures in southern India. Results: An increase in breast cancer incidence due to various modifiable risk factors was noted, especially in women over 40 years of age, with late stage of presentation, lack of awareness about screening, costs, fear and stigma associated with the disease serving as major barriers for early presentation. Conclusions: Educational strategies should be aimed at modifying the life style, early planning of pregnancy, promoting breast feeding and physical activity. It is very important to obtain reliable data for planning policies, decision-making and setting up the priorities.

AB  - Tourism, the third largest industry in the world, is worth US$ 1.4 trillion, and represents 10 per cent of the world's GDP. Tourism is also responsible for five per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, of which hotels and other types of accommodation account for one per cent. In this context, a sustainable hotel strategy execution is essential for maintaining and improving our planet's socio-economic and ecological balance. This systematic review lays the foundation for the development of a sustainable hotel strategy decision and execution support tool. Systems thinking and system dynamics allow the modelling of the interdependent elements of a complex hotel system, followed by a scenario simulation for proper strategy-analysis and strategy-decision. The execution of the chosen strategy can then be compared with the expected results. With a view to appraising the potential development of such a sustainable hotel strategy execution model for any tourism destination, a systematic literature review was carried out on existing sustainable strategy execution models and tools, as well as the existing use of systems thinking and system dynamics in the tourism and hotel sector.

AB  - Purpose - As an important emerging topic in recent years, reviews on tourism and hospitality social entrepreneurship (THSE) by theme remain limited. This paper aims to map the current publication trends, reveal the formation path and identify the future research directions of THSE, providing comprehensive and in-depth insight.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study presents a systematic review of 89 articles on THSE published in the Web of Science, ScienceDirect and EBSCOhost. It follows grounded theory to classify literature and an expert feedback process to ensure validity.
   Findings - Research on THSE is mainly found in developing countries and regions. Qualitative methods have been the most popular for researchers. This paper classifies THSE research into four main themes: antecedents, processes, effects and challenges.
   Practical implications - This review suggests that social enterprise managers should consider the inclusive business model and adopt empowerment, network construction, market approaches and bricolage to mobilize resources. Policymakers should disseminate relevant laws and regulations to provide a flexible and equal environment. Education and capacity building for people should be strengthened to train future social entrepreneurs.
   Originality/value - This review provides an integrated process model by clustering articles to update the holistic picture of THSE. This work identifies research gaps that future research should address.

AB  - Although the importance of effective corporate governance for firm performance is recognized by scholars across hospitality and tourism (HT) as well as finance and general management fields, there seem to be several gaps, mixed findings, and conflicting results. To facilitate scholarly advancement, identify gaps in the current knowledge base, make suggestions for theory development, and provide direction for future research, we undertake a systematic review of research on corporate governance in the HT literature. Based on 120 peer-reviewed articles published since 1961, we identify 21 themes explored by scholars, and find that topics related to institutional ownership, determinants of executive compensation, board size, and merger and acquisition outcomes are commonly examined, whereas topics related to family ownership, debt, and regulation/law are seldom explored. Our comprehensive review contributes to the literature by synthesizing current knowledge and offering suggestions to scholars to extend corporate governance literature published in the HT field.

AB  - Stakeholder-based brand is increasingly recognized as a measure for corporate sustainability, although the knowledge in this area is relatively unknown. Through a systematic review approach, the present study explores the global knowledge base on sustainability and brand. The most influential authors and documents are identified, followed by a discovery of the intellectual structure of the sustainability and brand knowledge base with five schools of thought. First, the Customer Attitudes and Behavior school refers to behavioral studies (one of the common approaches in sustainability studies). Second, the Tourism Marketing school represents the popular context of sustainability studies that mainly relates to hospitality, destination marketing, and fashion brand management. Third, the Brand Strategy school refers to corporate strategy concerning brand that is widely used to measure corporate sustainability performance such as brand equity. Fourth, the Societal Marketing school provides insights into the marketing strategy that leads a firm to achieve competitive advantages under concerns about finite resources and rising environmental and social costs. Finally, the Advanced Quantitative Analysis school reveals an approach that is mainly used when conducting sustainable marketing studies. A model on sustainability brand is then derived, adopting the grounded theory approach. Future research opportunities are also identified and discussed to continuously advance the scholarship in this specific area.

AB  - Objective: We sought to systematically review the literature on values and preferences for contraception among adolescents and young adults globally.
   Study design: We searched ten electronic databases for articles from January 1, 2005 through July 27, 2020 regarding end-users' values and preferences for contraception. We included studies that report specifically on people up to 25 years old.
   Results: Fifty-five studies out of 7,846 met our inclusion criteria. These studies included participants aged 10-25 years and were conducted in 16 countries. Through open coding, we identified 18 content areas. The five most commonly discussed content areas were: (1) general preferences regarding contraception, (2) contraceptive method benefits, (3) contraceptive method drawbacks, (4) the influence of the social context, and (5) the influence of myths and misconceptions, including safety and side effects, on contraceptive choice. Privacy and autonomy were important overarching themes, along with safety of the method. These considerations affected participants' access to and use of contraception.
   Conclusion: Various social, cultural, and method-specific factors influence a young person's values and preferences around contraceptive methods. Understanding their values and preferences can help providers and programs improve contraceptive care for young people. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, we face a rapid double growth of the ageing population that urges an integrated framework plan by connecting the health and social care disciplines as a shared and continuum of care approach. Bridging the gap between health and social care is required to meet the demand of ageing population needs, the readiness of the stakeholders, and community as a holistic approach. This article provides an overview of the evidence gap between social care and healthcare through a scoping review. Articles retrieved related to social and health care for older adults in the Asia region were identified through a compilation of PubMed, SAGE, Springer, and Google Scholar searches between the years 2015 to 2021. Only twelve articles were used for result generation. The majority highlights the constraint on financial support, issues related to culture, human resource competency and community participation. The systematic review of the current work provides valuable insight for future researchers and policymakers in designing sustainable development integrated long term care (LTC) framework models and plans.

AB  - There are many definitions of resilience, and a growing body of literature suggests that how resilience is defined may have significant consequences for planning and policy making outcomes. In the Great Lakes Region, resilience is gaining increasing attention from planners and policy makers in response to more frequent disruptions to social-ecological systems and built environments from coastal hazards. There has not yet been extensive research into how resilience is being defined in practice and how these definitions can affect geographies of risk and resilience and contribute to varying ecological, social, cultural, political, and economic outcomes. In this paper, we analyzed how stakeholders engaged in natural resource management activities within the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal environment define resilience and discuss the implications for planning and policy making through a critical geography and critical space lens. We systematically reviewed gray literature published by these stakeholders to document definitions of resilience. We then applied a 5Ws + H of resilience framework-resilience for whom, what, where, when, why, and how-to develop descriptive statistics and qualitatively analyze the definitions, considering the potential implications for ongoing regional planning and policy making efforts. Our analysis revealed a large degree of variation in the definitions, although we note two distinct gaps. We discuss how these gaps could affect ongoing regional planning and policy making efforts, and we lay out four research needs to inform planning and policy making going forward.

AB  - Background: Dentists administer hundreds of thousands of injections every day without particular concern, but the administration of local anesthetics can cause problems. One event, fortunately uncommon, that is discussed accurately but can cause significant concern is needle breakage. The purpose of this article is to review what has been reported in the literature on this topic to learn about patient symptomatology, management and possible complications. In addition, the case of a 34-year-old patient with needle persistence in the pterygoid space due to accidental rupture during inferior alveolar nerve block (IAN) was reported, for whom non-removal and monitoring over time was chosen. Materials and Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases was conducted analyzing anesthetic needle rupture during dental surgery. Results: At the end of the selection process, 17 articles resulted. Asymptomatic subjects were found, as well as those who had several symptoms. No issues were recorded by any of the authors, whether they withdrew the needle or simply monitored the patient. Conclusions: The literature on needle rupture during dental local anesthesia is scarce, and studies report conflicting results on treatment options. Most authors reported removing the fragment; however, others preferred conservative management limited to patient monitoring. No complications were reported in any study.

AB  - The paper seeks to advance our understanding of the extent to which the use of economic incentives can undermine ("crowd out") or reinforce ("crowd in") people's intrinsic motivations to engage in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. We first synthesize and classify the psychological mechanisms behind motivation crowding effects. Then we conduct a systematic review of empirical studies that test for motivation crowding effects triggered by economic incentives to encourage nature conservation. Based on eighteen empirical studies, we identify evidence of motivation crowding out and, to a lesser extent, crowding in effects. Finally, we discuss the implications for environmental policy and research. We note that the limited comparability of results across studies, the lack of baseline information about pre-existing intrinsic motivations, and a complexity stemming from cultural and contextual heterogeneity appear to be the main challenges when it comes to establishing more conclusive evidence. We conclude that, as economic instruments for conservation are increasingly being used worldwide, it is crucial to assess existing intrinsic motivations and expected changes in people's motivational structures prior to large-scale implementation. We call for caution with economic incentives in situations involving considerable uncertainty regarding the detrimental impacts on intrinsic motivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review examines the economic impact of Latin American regulations, strategies, and community involvement in mitigating the detrimental effects of mismanaged municipal domestic wastewater on public health, safety, and the economy. A systematic review and meta-analysis are conducted to assess the economic potential of reclaimed water in the region, utilizing various data sources and methodologies. The findings reveal that Latin America faces challenges in wastewater treatment, regulation, and resource management, affecting the market potential of reclaimed water. However, resource recovery initiatives present economic opportunities, including cost reduction, agricultural growth, energy recovery, and resource reuse.The study also highlights the lack of sanitation and wastewater treatment coverage data in many Latin American countries. By examining the commercial possibilities, regulatory frameworks, and environmental benefits of reclaimed water, this research provides valuable insights for sustainable water management and resource recovery policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. Furthermore, it emphasizes the economic advantages of utilizing reclaimed water and biosolids in Latin America, advocating for the implementation of strong regulations and policies to promote job creation and economic growth.

AB  - Mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Historically, mangroves are assumed to support artisanal fisheries, leading decision-makers to protect mangroves based on this premise. However, this relationship remains unclear, despite positive correlations obtained in different geographical regions. Here, we provide the first meta-analysis of the mangroves-fisheries linkage at a global level. After conducting a systematic review, 23 publications containing 51 studies estimating the mangrove-fishery linkage were obtained. A random effect model was used to estimate the effect size (Pearson's correlation coefficient) of each individual study as well as the overall effect size. We found strong evidence for the mangrove-fishery linkage with an overall effect size of r = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61-0.81), and substantial heterogeneity was observed (Q = 143.88, df = 50, P < 0.01). The countries where the studies were carried out were the only significant moderator (Q(M) = 26.07, P < 0.01), while fisheries types (i.e. crab, fish, shellfish, prawn and total) and global regions were not good predictors of the relationship. Our results show that mangrove area is a good predictor of fishery catches overall, confirming the importance of conserving such habitats.

AB  - Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) provide crucial ecosystem services to over half of humanity. However, populations living in these highly varied regions are now confronted by global change. It is critical that they are able to anticipate change to strategically manage resources and avoid potential conflict. Yet, planning for sustainable, equitable transitions for the future is a daunting task, considering the range of uncertainties and the unique character of MtSES. Participatory scenario planning (PSP) can help MtSES communities by critically reflecting on a wider array of innovative pathways for adaptive transformation. Although the design of effective approaches has been widely discussed, how PSP has been employed in MtSES has yet to be examined. Here, we present the first systematic global review of single- and multiscalar, multisectoral PSP undertaken in MtSES, in which we characterize the process, identify strengths and gaps, and suggest effective ways to apply PSP in MtSES. We used a nine-step process to help guide the analysis of 42 studies from 1989 screened articles. Our results indicate a steady increase in relevant studies since 2006, with 43% published between 2015 and 2017. These studies encompass 39 countries, with over 50% in Europe. PSP in MtSES is used predominantly to build cooperation, social learning, collaboration, and decision support, yet meeting these objectives is hindered by insufficient engagement with intended end users. MtSES PSP has focused largely on envisioning themes of governance, economy, land use change, and biodiversity, but has overlooked themes such as gender equality, public health, and sanitation. There are many avenues to expand and improve PSP in MtSES: to other regions, sectors, across a greater diversity of stakeholders, and with a specific focus on MtSES paradoxes. Communicating uncertainty, monitoring and evaluating impacts, and engendering more comparative approaches can further increase the utility of PSP for addressing MtSES challenges, with lessons for other complex social-ecological systems.

AB  - Circular economy can play an important role towards sustainable business management and it can be seen all throughout an organization. Although the current literature regards the circular economy as a guide for more sustainable business models, it is not clear the main implications to key business areas. Therefore this study aimed to present the key impacts of circular economy practices within different business areas that help guide a sustainable management of businesses. To that end, it was identified, by means of a systematic review of the existing literature, the business areas impacted by circular economy practices within an organization. The business areas identified were strategic planning, cost management, supply chain management, quality management, environmental management, process management, logistics and reverse logistics, service management, and research and development, allowing a discussion on the main contributions of the circular economy to each area. A key-impact map was provided summarizing the most influential changes in each area that assist in the management of businesses towards greater sustainability. It is important that organizations understand and accurately internalize circularity principles within their strategic plan. On that note, adopting a circular thinking might enable an organization to obtain more sustainable (economic) results while reducing impacts.

AB  - While climate change has global causations and impacts, there is growing consensus on addressing the 2 degrees C challenge through local actions. However, at the local level, there is disintegrated knowledge on the following: (a) short-, mid- and long-term climate vulnerability, (b) economy and GHG structures and their future pathways, and (c) useful mitigation and adaptation undertaken elsewhere. We evaluate these gaps through a comprehensive review of scientific literature and policy approaches of urban-climate studies in the Asia-Pacific Region. Based on the research findings, we develop a collaborative research framework of an integrated climate action planning (ICLAP) model for evidence-based decision-making tool. It adopts an innovative methodology integrating knowledge and data from diverse analytics, as follows: (a) spatial: downscaling global/regional climate scenarios to forecast local climate variability (50 km x 50 km) for 2030 (SDG target) and 2050; (b) statistical: a meta-analysis of 49 five-million-plus cities to forecast economic, energy and GHG scenarios; (c) bibliometric: a systematic review of global urban climate interventions from Google Scholar that collectively aid cities on policy inputs for mid-term climate variability, GHG profiles and available solutions at their disposal. We conclude with a discussion on scientific and policy relevance of such a tool in fostering overall urban, regional and global sustainability.

AB  - Current sustainability challenges - including biodiversity loss, pollution and land-use change require new ways of understanding, acting in and caring for the landscapes we live in. The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a 'boundary object'; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts - and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly - this paper can act as a helpful 'centering device', connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.

AB  - Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R-2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.

AB  - BackgroundThe ecosystem services provided by forests are essential for societal well-being. Production forests are increasingly expected to provide a range of ecosystem services in addition to wood biomass, as well as the biodiversity upon which many of these services depend. Production forests can be managed using different methods that affect the habitat provided and the biodiversity supported. Clearcutting (CC) is a widely used forest management system that has been criticised due to its negative effects on biodiversity. Alternative less intensive forest management systems have been developed with the hope of producing comparable levels of biomass with fewer negative impacts on forest biodiversity. One of these alternatives is continuous cover forestry (CCF); a management system that always maintains tree cover in an uneven-aged production forest stand. Many studies have been conducted which contrast the effects of CCF and CC on biodiversity with varying results. The aim of the review is to explore how CCF system compares to CC in terms of outcomes for terrestrial forest biodiversity.MethodsDue to the diverse vocabulary used to describe CCF, a systematic search for terms was carried out and a comprehensive search string will be used to maximise the likelihood of finding all relevant papers. We will gather, summarise and synthesise primary field studies, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, from temperate and boreal forest comparing biodiversity in CCF and CC stands. Species richness and abundance of plants, animals and fungi will be used to conduct a meta-analysis. Other biodiversity indicators and indices will be used for a narrative synthesis. As the effects of forest management depend on local conditions, we place a special emphasis on exploring the influence of various effect modifiers.

AB  - In view of the increased frequency of heat events and their negative effects, principally in cities, many scholars and practitioners are focusing on ways of adapting to climate change. The urban population and, especially, vulnerable groups, are now being affected to such a degree that adaptation measures are deemed necessary. Clearly, the planning and implementation of such measures are dependent on municipal resources. Tools can greatly assist in the planning of such measures at urban site level. This article provides a systematic review of the tools currently available for planning and implementing climate change adaptation measures in cities. The results offer a comprehensive overview of existing planning tools, which can also serve as a handy look-up document for urban planners searching for such tools. We find that many of these tools require considerable improvement and optimisation. For example, our findings demonstrate that outputs may be overly generalised, often there is no way of entering site-specific information while additional co-benefits (e.g. ecosystem services) are ignored. By analysing selected tools, we pinpoint and discuss requirements for future planning tools. In particular, we present a concept for a tool currently under development which is designed to assist in the planning and implementation of heat adaptation measures at diverse (small) spatial scales. The advantages of this tool are that it can assess the indoor thermal situation in addition to outdoor conditions, thereby providing comprehensive information on the suitability of adaptation measures. Furthermore, decision-making processes could benefit from some estimation of the likely co-benefits (here, ecosystem services) if proposed adaptation measures were implemented.

AB  - Background: Perceived and objectively-assessed aspects of the neighbourhood physical environment have been postulated to be key contributors to regular engagement in active travel (AT) in older adults. We systematically reviewed the literature on neighbourhood physical environmental correlates of AT in older adults and applied a novel meta-analytic approach to statistically quantify the strength of evidence for environment-AT associations.
   Methods: Forty two quantitative studies that estimated associations of aspects of the neighbourhood built environment with AT in older adults (aged >= 65 years) and met selection criteria were reviewed and meta-analysed. Findings were analysed according to five AT outcomes (total walking for transport, within-neighbourhood walking for transport, combined walking and cycling for transport, cycling for transport, and all AT outcomes combined) and seven categories of the neighbourhood physical environment (residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, access to/availability of services/destinations, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, aesthetics and cleanliness/order, and safety and traffic).
   Results: Most studies examined correlates of total walking for transport. A sufficient amount of evidence of positive associations with total walking for transport was found for residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, overall access to destinations/services, land use mix, pedestrian-friendly features and access to several types of destinations. Littering/vandalism/decay was negatively related to total walking for transport. Limited evidence was available on correlates of cycling and combined walking and cycling for transport, while sufficient evidence emerged for a positive association of within-neighbourhood walking with pedestrian-friendly features and availability of benches/sitting facilities. Correlates of all AT combined mirrored those of walking for transport. Positive associations were also observed with food outlets, business/institutional/industrial destinations, availability of street lights, easy access to building entrance and human and motorised traffic volume. Several but inconsistent individual-and environmental-level moderators of associations were identified.
   Conclusions: Results support strong links between the neighbourhood physical environment and older adults ' AT. Future research should focus on the identification of types and mixes of destinations that support AT in older adults and how these interact with individual characteristics and other environmental factors. Future research should also aim to clarify dose-response relationships through multi-country investigations and data-pooling from diverse geographical regions.

AB  - We are currently experiencing an unprecedented moment in forest restoration, where monitoring activities in recovery areas play a vital role in problem identification and method adaptation. However, it is crucial to shift away from expensive traditional methodologies and develop technologies that enable large-scale monitoring using more accessible and cost-effective tools. In an effort to provide an evidence-based perspective, we conducted a systematic review of how remotely piloted aircraft systems equipped with various sensors have been employed for forest monitoring. We consulted three databases and included 53 articles in our review. The results revealed a trend toward research in tropical ecosystems, with forest structure being the most frequently assessed attribute, and canopy height being the most widely measured structural indicator. Red-green-blue sensors were commonly used, both individually and in combination with others, and there was a noticeable shift toward the use of light detection and ranging. Data validation primarily relied on forest inventory methods, often involving comparisons of outputs from different sensors and the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. Despite the wide range of studies utilizing sensor-equipped drones to analyze forest attributes, there is a notable scarcity of research specifically addressing the application of these technologies in forest restoration monitoring. Filling this research gap is essential, as employing techniques that enable large-scale monitoring, such as aerial photogrammetry and remote sensing, aligns with current trends and contributes to global commitments to environmental restoration and conservation.

AB  - In 2019, B. Jarvis paraphrased E. Wilson in that "insects are a case study in terms of the invisible importance of the common". However, threats to insect diversity are rapidly increasing worldwide, and there is a significant challenge to halt or reverse this process. This is especially true in tropical regions where insect diversity is large, but resources are scarce and conservation policy is poorly developed. In Brazil, studies into insect conservation have grown over the last 30 years and, in this contribution, we use available literature to ask: i) what advances have been made; ii) where are the major knowledge gaps and iii) what are the priorities for action? Brazilian studies into insect conservation reflect international trends with respect to levels of ecological organization and a focus on taxonomic conservation. In general, research is restricted to the main Brazilian hotspots and to the states with better infrastructure. Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are the main orders studied. Work on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata has increased in recent years and currently are the main insect orders covered by official management due to their role as indicators of water quality. Priority areas for future work include the promotion of species conservation and ways to increase resource contribution from the private sector through legal instruments that can support integrative public policies for insect species conservation.

AB  - Decision making is a relevant task in the building construction sector, and various systems and methods for decision support are emerging. By means of a systematic literature review, this article identifies the methods for decision making in building construction and the lifecycle phases for which decision support systems are proposed. The selected articles are analyzed and grouped according to the adopted decision-making methods and the defined lifecycle phases. The findings show that multiple criteria decision analysis is the most used method for decision support in building construction and that the construction phase is the most addressed phase within the relevant existing works. The findings related to the construction phase are further refined by grouping the articles into application areas and by reviewing in detail the proposed methods therein. The scarce availability of data and project cases is identified as the most common barrier for the successful development and implementation of decision support systems in the building construction sector. This work provides a basis for scientists and practitioners for identifying suitable methods for decision-making support in a specific lifecycle phase of a building.

AB  - Soaring food demand, population pressure, land degradation, small size of agricultural land holdings, and diversified soil types in India require advanced digital soil mapping (DSM) for sustainable land management. This paper systematically reviews the common trends of SCORPAN based DSM in India to identify the important research gaps and opportunities to improve in future. A systematic literature search from 2000 to October 2021 has yielded 35 numbers of peer reviewed articles, which have performed DSM in India following the SCORPAN approach. The increased number of published articles from 2017 onwards suggests that there is a growing interest for DSM in India over the past few years. However, only two articles have prepared digital soil maps at the national extent. Moreover, the local and regional extent DSM are being limited to only a few parts of the country. There still remains 50% of the states and Union Territories of the country where no DSM studies have been performed so far except the national and global level interventions. Among the target variables, soil carbon related attributes have been predicted most frequently, whereas soil classes have been rarely predicted. Environmental covariates representing organism (O) and relief (R) have been widely included for DSM, whereas the use of other covariates has been limited. Among different machine learning (ML) algorithms, regression kriging has been adopted most frequently followed by random forest and quantile regression forest. Most articles have adopted data splitting (76%) as the model and map evaluation approach, whereas independent validation has been limited to only 5% of the articles. Only 34% of the articles have presented the uncertainty maps. Major research gaps identified by this review include lack of standardized digital soil databases, poor sampling density, coarse resolution, limited use of environmental covariates, insufficient comparative studies among ML algorithms, inadequate independent validation, and undersupply of uncertainty maps. Key evidences from this review will be helpful for improving future DSM activities by scientists and practitioners involved with DSM in India and abroad.

AB  - Island territories and their coastal regions are subject to a wide variety of stresses, both natural and anthropogenic. With increasing pressures on these vulnerable environments, the need to improve our knowledge of these ecosystems increases as well. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently shown their worth as a tool for data acquisition in coastal zones. This literature review explores the field of UAVs in the context of coastal monitoring on island territories by highlighting the types of platforms, sensors, software, and validation methods available for this relatively new data acquisition method. Reviewing the existing literature will assist data collectors, researchers, and risk managers in more efficiently monitoring their coastal zones on vulnerable island territories. The scientific literature reviewed was strictly analyzed in peer-reviewed articles ranging from 2016 to 2022. This review then focuses on the operationalization of the concept of resilience as a risk management technique. The aim is to identify a procedure from raw data acquisition to quantifying indicators for the evaluation of the resilience of a territory and finally linking the analyzed data to a spatial decision support system. This system could aid the decision-making process and uses the islands of French Polynesia and its Resilience Observatory as a case study.

AB  - Forests in mountain areas provide an indispensable ecosystem service by protecting people and infrastructure against natural hazards. As forests are increasingly affected by global change, including climate change, more frequent and severe natural disturbances, and shifts in land use, open questions remain regarding the long-term and sustainable provision of this crucial protective service. To improve our understanding of the various effects of global change on protective forests, we summarized the current knowledge based on a systematic review. Focusing on changes in mountain forests' protective effect against snow avalanches, landslides, rockfall, torrential floods and debris flow, we assessed 72 peer-reviewed, English publications. Overall, climate-induced changes are expected to increase forests' protective effect at higher elevations but reduce it at lower elevations mainly due to increased drought. Natural disturbances usually decrease the protective effect of forests, and their impact is often further exacerbated by salvage logging. Different forest management strategies are often studied using forest simulation models, and their impacts on protective forests strongly depend on the local context and interactions with climate change. While clearcuts consistently reduce the protective effect, other forest management interventions such as thinning can have either positive or negative effects. Most of the reviewed studies were case studies based on forest simulation or process-based hazard models (but rarely combining the two), while empirical evidence was scarce. Forests' protective effect is often assessed using (diverse) indicators of forest structure, but evaluations of resulting risks are less common. More consistent modeling approaches linking forest structure to hazard and risk, as well as consistent indicators across different case studies, are needed for a better understanding of changes in protective forests and the service they provide under global change.

AB  - Daily home-work travel is a habitual behavior that can be disrupted when the location of work, as one of the behavioral contexts, changes. It is then likely that individuals will reconsider their travel behavior more intentionally and choose alternative transport modes. To identify motivations and barriers to incorporating the use of sustainable modes into the individual's daily travel, this article systematically reviews the literature on the impacts of involuntary workplace relocation on commuting behavior. Effective measures that incentivize sustainable commuting behavior are also discussed. This study on involuntary workplace relocation informs considerations of changes in travel behavior related to other contextual changes.

AB  - Scholars are increasingly examining how the distributed blockchain technology can counter specific supply chain and operations management challenges. Various research approaches emerge from different scholarly backgrounds, but the interrelation of research areas and current trends has not been adequately considered in a systematic review. We employ a data-driven content analysis approach to examine previous research on blockchain technology in operations management and supply chain management. We investigate the extent to which blockchain technology was considered in scholarly works, structure the research efforts, and identify trends, interrelated themes, and promising research opportunities. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis is conducted on an extensive literature sample of 410 articles. Results indicate an optimistic attitude due to potentials such as tracking and tracing abilities, efficiency increases, and trust-building. Conceptual studies dominate the literature set, with increasing qualitative research efforts. Grand theories are seldomly addressed in the studies. Blockchain technology is outlined as particularly useful when combined with other technologies like IoT. We also identified sustainability implications of the technology, such as enabling transparency for SC stakeholders. Cryptocurrencies can facilitate further efficiency gains if legal uncertainties are reduced. The study is concluded with managerial and theoretical implications and future research opportunities.

AB  - Objective: To determine if providing general practitioners (GPs) with costing information can change their clinical behaviour and reduce medical costs.
   Data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Health Plan and EMBASE and citations in review articles were searched for studies published between 1980 and 1996.
   Study selection: Studies were included if they provided costing information to GPs with the aim of decreasing costs by changing behaviour, included an objective measure of GP performance or clinical care, and used a randomised or quasi-randomised controlled design, crossover design or a controlled time series.
   Data extraction: Data extracted included study design, intervention used and measure of GP performance/clinical care (including test ordering, drug prescribing, hospital and primary care visits and costs).
   Data synthesis: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Computerised feedback on drug costs increased generic prescribing, and ''academic detailing'' decreased inappropriate prescribing of target drugs. Providing costing information also decreased ordering of diagnostic tests. ''Gatekeeper'' physicians reduced use of hospital and specialist services. Only two studies found the changes were sustained for nine months or longer and only one evaluated health outcomes.
   Conclusion: The provision of costing information can change GP behaviour in all service areas. Sustainability of these changes and linking of cost savings to health outcomes have not been well studied.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review and bibliometric analysis in sustainable supply chain's futuristic technologies. The analysis involves 1596 articles published in the Scopus database from 1990 to 2020. The analysis examines the research outcomes by observing trends in journals, authorship, and keywords. The outcomes are visualized using VOSviewer to show the graphical network of co-authorship and the author's keywords. The results show that this research area has been a growing trend since 2016 and by 2020. The Journal of Cleaner Production was a leading journal in this area between 2016 and 2020, followed by Sustainability (Switzerland). The content analysis led to a classification of the articles into four main categories and sub-categories. The strategic diagram is used to reveal the emerging research themes analysis during the last 5 years (2016-2020) and to present future research. The data trending or emerging shows that technologies such as the technology by using combustion energy, renewable energy, and electric vehicles have been developing substantially. The research hotspots of the sustainable supply chain include, i.e., life cycle assessment (LCA), green investment, and carbon tax. Finally, the analysis also shows the research gaps that point a direction for future research.

AB  - Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is a rare neuroepithelial brain tumor, characterized by a high risk of local recurrence (greater than 70 % at 6 years). The aim of our study was to review the available literature on radiotherapy for PTPR in order to evaluate timings, schedules, outcomes and toxicities of this treatment modality. In our review, 72.4 % (84) of the patients diagnosed with PTPR received radiation therapy. There is heterogeneity in the dose prescription, ranging from 45 Gy (25 x 1.8 Gy) to 60 Gy (30 x 2 Gy) for 3D Conformal Radiation Therapy and from 12 Gy to 36 Gy for Stereotactic Radiosurgery. Being considered as a grade II or III tumor, PTPR should receive higher total radiation dose in the adjuvant setting. Our analysis showed a very limited treatment-related toxicity with an expected 10-y OS of 72.5 %. At 5-years from the diagnosis, about 60 % of the patients experienced a local recurrence, whereas at 10 years the rate is higher than 80 %. In the literature, conflicting data about radiotherapy for PTPR are reported, in particular regarding disease progression. Although radiotherapy represents a fundamental treatment in the management of PTPR, prospective studies are required to better define its impact on overall survival and progression-free survival.

AB  - Background: Field margin and non-crop vegetation in agricultural systems are potential ecosystem services providers because they offer semi-natural habitats for both below and above ground animal groups such as soil organisms, small mammals, birds and arthropods that are service supplying units. They are considered as a target area for enhancing farm biodiversity.
   Methodology: To explore the multiple potential benefits of these semi-natural habitats and to identify research trends and knowledge gaps globally, a review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 235 publications from the year 2000 to 2016 in the Scopus and Web of Science databases were reviewed.
   Results: The literature showed an increasing trend in the number of published articles over time with European studies leading in the proportion of studies conducted, followed by North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. Several functional groups of organisms were studied from field margin and non-crop vegetation around agricultural lands including natural enemies (37%), insect pests (22%), birds (17%), pollinators (16%), soil macro fauna (4%) and small mammals (4%). Ecosystem services derived from the field margin included natural pest regulation, pollination, nutrient cycling and reduced offsite erosion. Some field margin plants were reported to host detrimental crop pests, a major ecosystem dis-service, potentially leading to increased pest infestation in the field.
   Conclusion: The majority of studies revealed the importance of field margin and non-crop vegetation around arable fields in enhancing ecosystem biodiversity. Promotion of field margin plants that selectively enhance the population of beneficial organisms would support sustainable food security rather than simply boosting plant diversity. Our analyses also highlight that agro-ecological studies remain largely overlooked in some regions.

AB  - The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry, contributing 8% of all carbon emissions and 20% of all global wastewater, with an anticipated 50% increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To gain a better understanding of the state of the academic literature on the environmental impacts of the fast fashion industry, we systematically identified 65 publications from 1996 to November 2021 that were subjected to (i) bibliometric, (ii) text, and (iii) content analysis. We found that there is a growing research interest surrounding fast fashion and water quality, with 74% of the articles published in the last 5 years, and the majority of publications and citations are from China and European countries. We summarise the evaluation of production processes, such as carbon and water footprints, along with recycling practices aimed to increase the sustainability of the fashion industry. Circular economy, social environmental responsibility, and sustainability governance are key areas for future research in this growing field.

AB  - Biological invasions have become a defining feature of marine Mediterranean ecosystems with significant impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human health. We systematically reviewed the current knowledge on the impacts of marine biological invasions in the Mediterranean Sea. We screened relevant literature and applied a standardised framework that classifies mechanisms and magnitude of impacts and type of evidence. Overall, 103 alien and cryptogenic species were analysed, 59 of which were associated with both negative and positive impacts, 17 to only negative, and 13 to only positive; no impacts were found for 14 species. Evidence for most reported impacts (52%) was of medium strength, but for 32% of impact reports evidence was weak, based solely on expert judgement. Only 16% of the reported impacts were based on experimental studies. Our assessment allowed us to create an inventory of 88 alien and cryptogenic species from 16 different phyla with reported moderate to high impacts. The ten worst invasive species in terms of reported negative impacts on biodiversity include six algae, two fishes, and two molluscs, with the green alga Caulerpa cylindracea ranking first. Negative impacts on biodiversity prevailed over positive ones. Competition for resources, the creation of novel habitat through ecosystem engineering, and predation were the primary reported mechanisms of negative effects. Most cases of combined negative and positive impacts on biodiversity referred to community-level modifications. Overall, more positive than negative impacts were reported on ecosystem services, but this varied depending on the service. For human health, only negative impacts were recorded. Substantial variation was found among Mediterranean ecoregions in terms of mechanisms of impact and the taxonomic identity of impacting species. There was no evidence that the magnitude of impact increases with residence time. Holistic approaches and experimental research constitute the way forward to better understanding and managing biological invasions.

AB  - Continually using fossil fuels as the main source for producing electricity is one of the main factors causing global warming. Through the past years, several efforts have been made, looking for sustainable, environmentally friendly, and clean energy alternatives. Harvesting geothermal energy from roadway pavement is one of the alternatives that have been developed and investigated recently. Herein, a systematic review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the potentials of harvesting thermal energy from asphalt pavement and to assess the level of achievement being attained towards developed technologies. A total of 713 articles were initially collected, considering the period between 2006 and 2021; later, a series of filtration processes were performed to reach 47 publications. The thermal energy harvesting technologies were categorized into three main sectors, at which their basics and principles were discussed. In addition, a detailed description of the systems' configurations, materials, and efficiency was presented and described. Finally, gaps and future directions were summarized at the end of this paper. The fundamental knowledge introduced herein can inspire researchers to detect research gaps and serve as a wake-up call to motivate them to explore the high potentials of utilizing pavements as a clean and sustainable energy source.

AB  - Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW ("DW enrichment") has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.

AB  - Despite extensive literature on the socio-cultural services of urban open spaces, the role of food-producing spaces has not received sufficient attention. This hampers advocacy for preserving and growing urban agricultural activities, often dismissed on justifications that their contributions to overall food supply are negligible. To understand how the social benefits of urban agriculture have been measured, we conducted a systematic review of 272 peer-reviewed publications, which drew on insights from urban agriculture sites in 57 different countries. Through content analysis, we investigated socio-cultural benefits in four spheres: engaged and cohesive communities, health and well-being, economic opportunities, and education. The analysis revealed growth in research on the social impacts of gardens and farms, with most studies measuring the effects on community cohesion and engagement, followed by increased availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables associated with reduced food insecurity and better health. Fewer studies assessed the impact of urban farming on educational and economic outcomes. Quantifying the multiple ways in which urban agriculture provides benefits to people will empower planners and the private sector to justify future investments. These findings are also informative for research theorizing cities as socio-ecological systems and broader efforts to measure the benefits of urban agriculture, in its many forms.

AB  - Glaciers across Canada are rapidly retreating, engendering significant implications for glacier-fed hydrological systems, ranging from aquatic ecology and groundwater recharge to downstream economic activities and traditional cultural values. Despite a well-developed body of literature regarding glacio-hydrological systems and dynamics, there has been no systematic assessment of this research to date. In response, this study adopted a systematic review methodology to examine the state of existing peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological literature in Canada (1900-2021). We found that peer-reviewed glacio-hydrological research in Canada emerged in the early 1950s and has substantially grown over the last two decades, with almost all work being done by natural scientists using field-based approaches to examine physical hydrology, water quantity and resources, and water quality in western Canada. There is a declining trend in research related to glacio-hydrological hazards and a relative lack of research related to glacier ecohydrology, human vulnerability, and adaptation. The absence of such work constrains our ability to adapt to the consequences of climatic change and other anthropogenic stressors. In highlighting these gaps, this study aims to inform research needs and contribute to evidence-based policy formation that supports regionally appropriate plans, enhancing our ability to navigate the current and future challenges facing glacio-hydrologic systems in Canada, including the human and non-human systems that depend on them.
   Partout au Canada, les glaciers reculent rapidement, ce qui entraine des consequences importantes pour les systemes hydrologiques alimentes par les glaciers, allant de l'ecologie aquatique et de la recharge des eaux souterraines aux activites economiques en aval et aux valeurs culturelles traditionnelles. Malgre un corpus de litterature bien developpe concernant les systemes et les dynamiques glacio-hydrologiques, il n'existe pas d'evaluation systematique de cette recherche a ce jour. En reponse, cette etude a adopte une methodologie d'examen systematique pour examiner l'etat de la litterature glacio-hydrologique existante evaluee par des pairs au Canada (1900-2021). Nous avons constate que la recherche glacio-hydrologique evaluee par des pairs au Canada a vu le jour au debut des annees 1950 et s'est considerablement developpee au cours des deux dernieres decennies, la quasi-totalite des travaux etant effectues par des specialistes des sciences naturelles utilisant des approches basees sur le terrain pour examiner l'hydrologie physique, la quantite et qualite d'eau et les ressources en eaux dans l'ouest du Canada. Il existe une tendance a la baisse dans la recherche liee aux risques glacio-hydrologiques et un manque relatif de recherche liee a l'ecohydrologie des glaciers, a la vulnerabilite humaine et a l'adaptation. L'absence de tels travaux limite notre capacite a nous adapter aux consequences du changement climatique et d'autres facteurs de stress anthropiques. En mettant en evidence ces lacunes, cette etude vise a eclairer les besoins de recherche et a contribuer a l'elaboration de politiques fondees sur des donnees probantes qui soutiennent des plans appropries a l'echelle regionale, ameliorant ainsi notre capacite a relever les defis actuels et futurs auxquels sont confrontes les systemes glacio-hydrologiques du Canada, y compris les facteurs humains et non-hydrologiques, et les systemes humains qui en dependent.

AB  - Although virtual learning environments (VLEs) have long been forecasted to accelerate the educational revolution, their adoption by teachers and students has not always been as effective as is expected over the years. This challenges universities that extensively investigated educational technologies. Stakeholders are keen to understand the underlying factors and mechanisms that influence technology adoption. However, the extant contradictive and inconsistent research findings from individual country or region fail to address the problem. To provide a holistic view, we follow the PRISMA protocol and synthesize 145 empirical studies across 42 countries and regions from 2001 to 2020. Our main contribution lies in integrating the institutional theory and the elements of country, culture, and university with the decision to adopt VLEs. Specifically, we develop three individual themes and two institutional themes about the factor characteristics. Power distance associates with the institutional cognitive-cultural influence, and long- and short-term orientation affects VLE adoption through the institutional normative facilitation. Masculinity-femininity links to individual cognition, while uncertainty avoidance has a connection with individual digital capability in the VLE adoption processes. We suggest that cultural dimensions should be examined as explanatory variables in future research. Implications and research significance in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.

AB  - Despite the fact that some renewable energy (RE) technologies are already techno-economically viable, the high spatial dilution nature of their sources, together with aspects beyond the techno-economic ones (such as environmental, social, cultural, and other aspects), can become strong constraints and barriers when it comes to their integration into electric systems. Therefore, with the objective of determining whether studies on spatial energy planning (SEP) are addressing these issues, a systematic review has been carried out to address whether SEP studies are considering aspects beyond the techno-economic ones when integrating RE technologies and, if they are being considered, how they are addressed in their analyses and what criteria, factors, and indicators of the aspects that are employed. Apart from the revelation that the concept of SEP has been included within high-quality scientific literature for less than ten years, SEP seems to be an unexploited tool with the potential to provide significant insight into a planning process that could prevent conflicts when integrating RE technologies into electric systems. This would be useful for decision-makers and for accelerating a sustainable energy transition.

AB  - Urbanization affects the occurrence, abundance and distribution of pollinators worldwide. Although urban green spaces support many pollinators, global estimates of urban pollinator diversity are still lacking. Here, we present a global overview of urban pollinators, characterizing the most frequently recorded species and functional groups, as well as the types of urban green spaces where these pollinators were most frequently recorded. A systematic review of the literature revealed a total of 11,560 pollinator records in urban green areas. These comprised 3148 species from 255 cities in 46 countries, with more than half of the studies (similar to 67 %) carried out in non-tropical cities. Hymenoptera was the main pollinator group recorded, especially bees, followed by Lepidoptera and Diptera worldwide. However, birds were more commonly reported in tropical than non-tropical regions, highlighting their importance as pollinators in the tropics. The most frequently recorded species were social and generalist bees, including invasive and managed species. Hence, while some bees may be able to persist in urban areas, other groups may face challenges that need to be considered when planning urban pollinator conservation. Considering the urban habitat types where pollinators were sampled, university campuses and gardens were the most common types investigated in tropical and non-tropical regions, respectively. These results may reflect regional differences in urban landscape characteristics, as well as a research bias caused by greater investment in urban ecology research in non-tropical countries. Our review synthetizes the diversity of urban pollinators worldwide and highlights the gaps and challenges in promoting their conservation more inclusively.

AB  - Integrating resilience into governance policies has facilitated disaster prevention and recovery strategies, as urbanization and climate change have led to various environmental mishaps. This study aims to answer the following questions through a systematic review of the literature on resilient cities, disaster resilience, and the impact of resilience on urban structures, using the ISO 37123 technical standard and the sustainability tripod: (1) How has the landscape of research surrounding resilient cities evolved? (2) Which axis of the sustainability tripod receives the most focus in research on resilient cities? The findings suggest that research on resilient cities is focused on developing both practical and theoretical definitions for the term, with a particular emphasis on finding solutions to human influences such as urbanization and environmental disasters. It is noted that the definition of resilience remains ambiguous, and each group of researchers can interpret or find the meaning of resilience. More investment is needed to develop resilience, particularly in disaster prevention and recovery, highlighting the social and environmental axes of the sustainability tripod and encouraging the population's participation in public decisions.

AB  - The impacts of climate change-related events on mental health and emotional wellbeing have gained increased attention in recent years. However, research exploring how climate mitigation action, i.e., moving toward more sustainable lifestyles, interrelates with mental health is arguably a more hidden body of work. This research is scattered across fields and uses a variety of concepts to explore both the role that emotional and mental health management skills may play in enabling personal climate mitigation actions, as well as the ways in which accelerated transitions toward lower carbon emitting ways of life may impact on mental wellbeing at both an individual and societal level. Our systematic review therefore aims to bring together for the first time research which has been undertaken in the emerging area of mental health and climate mitigation action. To facilitate this exploration, systematic Web of Science searches were undertaken which: (1) identified 165 publications exploring climate change and mental health issues broadly, and (2) identified 26 publications relating climate mitigation actions with specific mental health impacts (anxiety, trauma, suicide, OCD). We find that mental health is primarily being seen as an outcome of climate change impacts, not a factor in our ability to work to avoid them. The limited work which does exist around mental health and climate mitigation action focusses on anxiety and trauma and spans the psychological, psychosocial, public health and wider social sciences. Anxiety and trauma-avoidance has been found to both stimulate and stifle action in different circumstances. One explanation may be the role organizations (and other social structures like family or gender identities) play in maintaining cultures which either support social defenses against mitigation action or provide emotionally-safe spaces for building climate commitment. Anticipating potential mental health impacts during policy planning-and putting in place appropriate support measures-will be vital to successfully meeting climate targets. We therefore conclude with implications for policy and practice, including the need to: build appropriate psychological support into behavior change interventions, work with groups who can provide each other with emotional peer support, and ensure health and social care professionals are given adequate training.

AB  - With high analytical capability, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides insights suitable to the context that add value to decision making and finds its applications in different sectors. Researchers envisage sustainable agriculture for meeting rising food demand of growing population with the use of AI. Using an algorithmic approach, this paper identifies key determinants influencing adoption of AI in agriculture through a systematic review of literature and a framework is proposed based on well-known theories of Information Systems. The identified factors were classified into five categories - individual characteristics, environmental factors, structural factors, technology factors and demographic factors. The authors indicate need for empowering facilitators for increasing adoption rate and highlight the importance of building trust among farmers for using new applications. The findings of this paper will enrich the understanding of researchers, AI solution developers and service-providers to customise the solution and devise communication strategies for increasing reachability to improve its adoption.

AB  - Global warming and the environmental problems arising from it are posing a serious threat to the peaceful co-existence of the human and the natural worlds. The drastic depletion of fossil fuels, in particular, has made it imperative that we find alternative ways of manufacturing that can support upcoming industries without causing further loss or damage to our natural resources. This critical situation has given rise to a pressing need for a cohesive and strategic research that can address the needs of industries while simultaneously ensuring the implementation of environmentally sustainable manufacturing methods. However, the adoption of environmentally sustainable concepts is a challenging task for industries and a thorough, comprehensive and insightful research is essential in order to support and facilitate this task. From the literature available, it can be assumed with certainty that industries are currently making substantial efforts to ensure that their manufacturing-related operations are as green and as sustainable as possible. The literature review contained in this paper endeavours to assess, from a global perspective, the various challenges that hinder these efforts while bearing in mind the positive trend in industrial operations. It may also be worth noting that there are not much research so far on green concept in sustainable manufacturing and this paper adds value to the existing research by focusing on this hitherto neglected area.

AB  - Urban agriculture is the practice of growing food inside the city limits. Due to the exponential amount of data generated by information and technology-based farm management systems, we need proper methods to represent the data. The branch of artificial intelligence known as "knowledge representation and reasoning" is devoted to the representation of information about the environment in a way where a computer system can utilise it to accomplish difficult problems. This research is an extensive survey of the knowledge representation techniques used in smart agriculture, and specifically in the urban agricultural domain. Relevant articles on the knowledge base are extracted from the retrieved set to study the fulfillment of the criteria of the system. Various interesting findings were observed after the review. Spatial-temporal characteristics were rarely approached. A generalised representation technique to include all domains in agriculture is another issue. Finally, proper validation technique is found to be missing in such an ontology.

AB  - The European seaweed sector transitions from harvesting wild stocks only to harvesting and farming seaweed. This transition comes with the need to rethink the role of the European sector on the global scale; insight is needed into the organization of, and innovation in, the global seaweed value chain. This article presents results from our study on value chains using Gereffi's conceptual framework. A systematic review of scientific publications published between 2010 and 2020 was executed for five markets: pharmaceuticals, bioplastics, biostimulants, alginate and cosmetics. It is concluded that innovation in the use of seaweed takes place across the globe and thus that a focus on high-value applications alone will not set the nascent European seaweed sector apart from established producing regions such as Asia. The studied global value chains are organised around strong lead firms that require suppliers to produce according to codified product characteristics. The European seaweed sector needs to increase the collaboration and develop joint efforts to develop safe and sustainable products that meet the demands of regulators, lead firms and consumers. Stronger coordination in the value chain will facilitate further business development, by stimulating collaboration and innovations.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic review of the research literature that applies quantitative techniques to inform incentive programs and policies promoting pro-environmental behavior and technology adoption among individual consumers. The paper points out that, while the number of active incentive programs is large, there is a dire need for scientific advances that could increase their impact in calculated ways. The expertise of the operations research and management science community, as well as industrial, systems, civil, and environmental engineering experience, appears to be particularly well suited to support such effort. The review covers the research work performed in three areas of practical importance: efficient energy consumption, waste management, and stormwater management. The types of analytical models and data analysis techniques developed to support policy-making in each area are summarized, highlighting the imbalance between the descriptive versus prescriptive contributions made to date.

AB  - Innovation plays an essential role in addressing the interlinked environmental, social, and economic challenges facing the agri-food sectors in the North Africa region. This systematic review analyses the state of research on innovation in North African agri-food sector and investigates whether sustainability is addressed in the research strand. The analysis shows an increasing interest in the research field, although many publications are authored by scholars based in institutions outside North Africa. Most of the selected documents deal with crops and the production stage of the food chain. The focus is generally on technical innovations while social, organizational, and marketing ones are overlooked. There are growing attempts to connect innovation to sustainability and sustainable development by moving towards the concept of 'sustainable innovation'. Factors hindering agri-food innovation relate to policy, research, institutional environment, extension, and human capital. The promotion of innovation in the North African agri-food sector is crucial to unlock the sector's potential and improve its competiveness, resilience, and sustainability.

AB  - Land-use changes, both in terms of land abandonment and intensification, have led to fragmentation and loss of traditional agricultural habitats. Extensive grazing is among the forms of land use that have undergone the greatest changes. This represents one of the main threats to biodiversity; consequently, a comprehensive overview about the impacts on the biodiversity of changes that are happening in pastoral activities is needed. Moreover, a clear picture of the most widely studied geographical areas, habitats, and taxonomic groups needs to be developed in order to understand the situation. In this framework, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the publications related to the impacts of pastoral activities on animal biodiversity in Europe. We analysed 223 articles by searching the ISI Web of Science platform and combining keywords related to "pastoral activities" and "biodiversity indicators", applying a vote count approach, i.e. simply dividing articles into categories depending on their results (non-significant ones, significant positive results, significant negative ones). Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis on 33 articles, selecting those focusing on Arthropods (the most studied taxa). To understand the main gaps in this scientific topic, we focused on:
   i) the identification of the geographical, environmental, and temporal structure of the studies;
   ii) the description of the main target groups used as bio-indicators; iii) the comparison of different management practices (overgrazing, traditional, agri-environment schemes - AESs), plus land abandonment, to determine which is the best for biodiversity conservation and to evaluate the effectiveness of AESs.
   There was a bias towards lowlands in comparison to uplands, as well as a lack of long-term studies. Plants were more sensitive than animals to grazing changes. Arthropods' orders are the taxa used most frequently as indicators, in comparison with vertebrates, especially birds. We identified a generalised negative impact of overgrazing in all the habitats and geographical areas, apparently except in mountainous shrubland. Conversely, land abandonment resulted in a negative influence on biodiversity only in the mountainous areas of southern Europe (underlining the important role of traditional activities), whereas short term abandonment had a beneficial role in central Europe, where overgrazing was more widespread. The meta-analysis suggested that arthropod richness was higher in short to mid-term abandoned pastures than under either extensive or intensive grazing systems.
   Finally, the effectiveness of AESs for conservation purposes was not confirmed by the vote count approach, whilst meta-analysis detected a positive effect for Arthropods of these same management practices when compared to overgrazing. We highlight a lack of data on AESs, especially when compared with traditional extensive grazing or abandonment. Our findings suggest that AES seems to effectively mimic traditional pastures, contrasting overgrazing, which is one of its main goal. Since AES have a strong potential in influencing sustainable management and promoting biodiversity conservation, the European Union should focus on the most effective and well targeted AES based on research, and further studies will be necessary to continuously assess their effect.

AB  - Epiphytes and their associated decomposing litter and arboreal soils (herein, epiphytic material, EM) are ubiquitous features of tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) and play important roles in ecosystem function. EM intercepts water and nutrients from the atmosphere and from intercepted host tree sources, and may contribute significant inputs of these resources to the forest floor. Despite the importance of EM in the TMCF, a systematic review of the ecosystem roles of EM has not been compiled before. We have synthesized the literature that documents functions of EM in undisturbed TMCFs and discuss how these roles may be affected by disturbances, including changes in climate and land use. The range of EM biomass and water storage in the TMCF varies greatly across sites, with different amounts associated with stand age and microclimate. EM is important as habitat and food for birds and mammals, with over 200 species of birds documented as using EM in the Neotropics. Given its sensitivity to moisture, projected shifts in cloud base heights or precipitation due to changes in climate will likely have a large impact on this community and changes in EM diversity or abundance may have cascading impacts on the ecosystem function of the TMCF.

AB  - Background Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees or other woody perennials with crops or livestock in production systems, is being widely promoted as a conservation and development tool to help meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social-ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well-studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence-based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives. Objectives The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub-groups of the population. Search Methods This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid-2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review. Selection Criteria We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well-being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade-grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before-after comparison. Data Collection and Analysis We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta-analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta-analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta-analysis were discussed narratively. Main Results We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi-experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low.
   Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta-analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g = 1.16 [-0.35, 2.67] (p = .13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I-2 = 98.99%, tau 2 = 2.94, Q(df = 4) = 370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta-analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g = 0.12 [-0.06, 0.30] (p = .20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I-2 = 75.29%, tau 2 = 0.04, Q(df = 6) = 19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub-groups, including differential impacts on small-holders versus large-holders, on woman-headed households versus male-headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small-holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design. Authors' Conclusions There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio-economic factors in determining suitable intervention design.
   Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi-experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time-periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices.

AB  - Background
   Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease often causing decreased quality of life, social withdrawal and unemployment. Studies examining the effect of pharmacological interventions demonstrated only minor effects, whereas non-pharmacological interventions as e.g. patient education programs have shown promising results.
   Objective
   We aim to systematically review the literature to determine the effect of patient education programs on fatigue in MS.
   Methods
   We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated patient education programs for MS-related fatigue. Interventions evaluating physical exercise and/or pharmacological treatments were not included. Meta-analyses were performed using the generic inverse variance method.
   Results
   The search identified 856 citations. After full-text screening we identified ten trials that met the inclusion criteria. Data of 1021 participants were analyzed. Meta-analyses showed significant positive effects on fatigue severity (weighted mean difference -0.43; 95% CI-0.74 to-0.11) and fatigue impact (-0.48;-0.82 to-0.15), but not for depression (-0.35 (95% CI-0.75 to 0.05; p = 0.08). Essentially, we categorized patient education programs into two types: firstly, interventions with a focus on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and secondly, interventions that teach patients ways of managing daily fatigue. CBT-based approaches seem to generate better results in reducing patient-reported fatigue severity. Analysing CBT studies only, the pooled weighted mean difference for fatigue severity was -0.60 (95% CI; -1.08 to -0.11) compared to non-CBT approaches (-0.20; 95% CI;-0.60 to -0.19). Furthermore, interventions employing an individual approach seem to reduce fatigue more effectively than group-based approaches (pooled weighted mean difference for fatigue severity in face-to-face studies was -0.80 (95% CI;-1.13 to -0.47) compared to group-based studies with -0,17 (95% CI; -0,39 to 0,05). Longest follow-up data were available for 12 months post-intervention.
   Conclusion
   Overall, included studies demonstrated that educational programs and especially CBTbased approaches have a positive effect on reducing fatigue. Since fatigue is thought to be a multidimensional symptom, it should be treated with a multidimensional approach targeting patients' behavior as well as their emotional and mental attitude towards fatigue. However, the clinical relevance of the treatment effects i.e. the relevance for patients' daily functioning remains unclear and long-term effects, i.e. sustainability of effects beyond 6 months, warrants further work. This review has been registered in the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews data base (Registration number: CRD42014014224).

AB  - Diverse perspectives and ideas among senior leaders (top management teams and boards of directors) might generate substantial value for organizations. In theory, such diversity could provide a foundation for creative insights, innovative strategies, and strong organizational performance. Unfortunately, empirical research on these and other possible outcomes has generated a complex array of confusing findings. Our systematic review, the first to consider all types of relevant studies, attempts to make sense of the complicated landscape. On the negative side of the coin, the review highlights unsolved theoretical puzzles, severely fragmented empirical studies, and methodological conundrums. As a result, it calls into question several widespread assumptions and practices. On the positive side of the coin, our work surfaces some important pockets of consistency in existing empirical findings, mostly driven by studies using direct measures of cognitive diversity among senior leaders rather than demographic proxies. Our recommendations for the future include dramatically increasing qualitative research to move beyond a powerful deductive straightjacket that seems to exist. We also recommend taking a finer-grained approach through a substantial narrowing of quantitative research in the near term to better capture and understand key concepts, measures, and boundary conditions.

AB  - Non-household carpools (where two or more commuters from different residences travel together in the same private vehicle) bring public benefits. To encourage and incentivise it, transport practitioners and researchers must understand its private motivations and deterrents. Existing studies often report conflicting results or non-generalisable findings. Thus, a quantitative systematic review of the literature body is needed. Using meta-analysis, this study synthesised 22 existing empirical studies (representing over 79,000 observations) to produce an integrated review of the carpooling literature. The meta-analysis determined 24 non-household carpooling factors, and their effect sizes. Factors such as number of employees (), partner matching programs (), female () and fixed work schedule () were found to have strong effects on carpooling while judgmental factors (such as the motivation to save costs) only exhibited small influence (). Based on the significant effects, the paper discussed prospects for improving carpooling uptake by developing: (i) target demographics, (ii) selling points for marketing, (iii) carpooling partner programs and (iv) multiple employer 'super-pools'. The results warrant caution due to the small amount of studies synthesised. Transport practitioners might plan carpooling policies based on the findings; and transportation researchers might use the list of factors to model carpooling behaviour.

AB  - Road freight transport is one of the sectors with the highest greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption in the logistics industry. In recent years, due to the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, several companies have considered reducing them in their daily logistics operations by means of better routing management. Green vehicle routing problems (GVRPs) constitute a growing problem direction within the interplay of vehicle routing problems and environmental sustainability that aims to provide effective routes while considering environmental concerns. These NP-hard problems are one of the most studied ones in green logistics, and due to their difficulty, there are many different heuristic and hybrid techniques to solve them under the need of having high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time. Given the role and importance of these methods, this review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of them while reviewing their defining strategies and components. In addition, we analyze characteristics and problem components related to how emissions are being considered. Lastly, we map and analyze the benchmarks proposed so far for the different GVRP variants considering emissions.

AB  - Background: Co-creation is an approach that aims to democratize research and bridge the gap between research and practice, but the potential fragmentation of knowledge about co-creation has hindered progress. A comprehensive database of published literature from multidisciplinary sources can address this fragmentation through the integration of diverse perspectives, identification and dissemination of best practices, and increase clarity about co-creation. However, two considerable challenges exist. First, there is uncertainty about co-creation terminology, making it difficult to identify relevant literature. Second, the exponential growth of scientific publications has led to an overwhelming amount of literature that surpasses the human capacity for a comprehensive review. These challenges hinder progress in co-creation research and underscore the need for a novel methodology to consolidate and investigate the literature.
   Objective: This study aimed to synthesize knowledge about co-creation across various fields through the development and application of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted selection process. The ultimate goal of this database was to provide stakeholders interested in co-creation with relevant literature.
   Methods: We created a novel methodology for establishing a curated database. To accommodate the variation in terminology, we used a broad definition of co-creation that encompassed the essence of existing definitions. To filter out irrelevant information, an AI-assisted selection process was used. In addition, we conducted bibliometric analyses and quality control procedures to assess content and accuracy. Overall, this approach allowed us to develop a robust and reliable database that serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders interested in co-creation.
   Results: The final version of the database included 13,501 papers, which are indexed in Zenodo and accessible in an open-access downloadable format. The quality assessment revealed that 20.3% (140/688) of the database likely contained irrelevant material, whereas the methodology captured 91% (58/64) of the relevant literature. Participatory and variations of the term co-creation were the most frequent terms in the title and abstracts of included literature. The predominant source journals included health sciences, sustainability, environmental sciences, medical research, and health services research.
   Conclusions: This study produced a high-quality, open-access database about co-creation. The study demonstrates that it is possible to perform a systematic review selection process on a fragmented concept using human-AI collaboration. Our unified concept of co-creation includes the co-approaches (co-creation, co-design, and co-production), forms of participatory research, and user involvement. Our analysis of authorship, citations, and source landscape highlights the potential lack of collaboration among co-creation researchers and underscores the need for future investigation into the different research methodologies. The database provides a resource for relevant literature and can support rapid literature reviews about co-creation. It also offers clarity about the current co-creation landscape and helps to address barriers that researchers may face when seeking evidence about co-creation.

AB  - Human-induced changes in river flow regimes are ubiquitous worldwide. Although numerous case studies have identified negative ecological impacts of changes in different aspects of flow regimes (e.g. magnitude, timing), there have been few attempts to systematically review this literature to derive general relationships regarding ecological responses to changes in flow regimes. Systematic literature reviews can inform science and management in ecologically complex systems not amenable to experimentation. However, such analysis of existing literature is often limited by inconsistent study design and data reporting. To attempt to overcome these difficulties, we used the recently developed Eco Evidence method and software to analyse 165 studies of ecological responses to changes in river flow regimes. Eco Evidence provides a rule set and standardised list of terms to assist reviewers to interpret consistently the results of disparate studies. The companion software assists with the synthesis of this information to reach transparent and repeatable conclusions regarding cause-effect hypotheses of ecological responses to environmental drivers. We compared our results to those of a recent, informal systematic review of the same studies, which is proving extremely influential. Stronger conclusions are reached when evidence is weighted, classified and combined according to the rules in Eco Evidence. Compared to the original review, we reached informative conclusions for a larger number of flow-response hypotheses, found that hypotheses for which the most evidence was available returned inconsistent results, addressed hypotheses at levels of conceptual resolution relevant to management and identified where insufficient evidence exists to reach a conclusion. Analyses conducted at several levels of conceptual resolution found strong support for many hypotheses regarding ecological impacts. We found a consistent sensitivity to changes in flow regime for both fish and riparian vegetation across a variety of performance metrics. While macroinvertebrate responses varied among performance metrics (e.g. abundance was negatively affected by increases or decreases in flows, diversity was only negatively affected by flow decreases, and assemblage structure was affected by neither), they were largely consistent within these metrics. We thus conclude that the Eco Evidence approach allowed us to extract more knowledge from the data set than was possible in the original review. Eco Evidence can improve synthesis of the burgeoning ecological literature and improve our general understanding in ecology. Amid widespread calls for evidence-based' environmental management, this powerful tool provides managers with a means of using research to help inform complex environmental decision-making.

AB  - Forests are among the most important ecosystems that provide various hydrological services including water production and protection because the vast majority of the water available on the earth comes from forested catchments. The forests provide quality and continuous water yield as well as protective services such as flood control, soil protection, landslide protection, avalanche protection, and prevention against rock falls, which are related to water. However, the quality and quantity of all the forest functions are influenced by forest ecosystem structure and composition such as forest type, tree species, age class distribution, biomass, leaf area, basal area, crown closure, and stand development stages. This study provides an assessment of hydrological services of forest ecosystems through the systematic review of relevant literature till 2018. It mainly focuses on water-forest relations and explains how forest ecosystem structure and composition affect water production, quality, and sustainability. Then, a general framework relating to the integration of hydrological services into forest management is concluded in the context of sustainable management of natural resources.

AB  - The study presents an overview of green marketing and the gap between attitude and actual purchase behaviour of consumers towards green products. A total of 232 studies have been analysed using a systematic review to develop a green purchase decision-making model. A thematic analysis helped in the identification of three major themes namely; personal factors affecting green purchase; green purchase; and green marketing mix. The concern for eco-environment, eco-labelling, past experiences and perceived usefulness have been identified as major influencers of green consumer behaviour. Lack of environmental knowledge, price, perceived associated risks, organizational image, trust, and willingness to pay has been identified as barriers, creating a gap between attitude and actual purchase behaviour of consumers towards green products. On the basis of analysis, a green purchase decision model has been proposed and also potential areas of future research have been suggested.

AB  - The structure and stability of grassland ecosystems have a significant impact on biodiversity, material cycling and productivity for ecosystem services. However, the issue of the structure and stability of grassland ecosystems has not been systematically reviewed. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, we used the systematic-review method and screened 133 papers to describe and analyze the frontiers of research into the structure and stability of grassland ecosystems. The research results showed that: (1) The number of articles about the structure and stability of grassland ecosystems is gradually increasing, and the research themes are becoming increasingly diverse. (2) There is a high degree of consistency between the study area and the spatial distribution of grassland. (3) Based on the changes in ecosystem patterns and their interrelationships with ecosystem processes, we reviewed the research progress and landmark results on the structure, stability, structure-stability relationship and their influencing factors of grassland ecosystems; among them, the study of structure is the main research focus (51.12%), followed by the study of the influencing factors of structure and stability (37.57%). (4) Key scientific questions on structural optimization, stability enhancement and harmonizing the relationship between structure and stability are explored. (5) Based on the background of karst desertification control (KDC) and its geographical characteristics, three insights are proposed to optimize the spatial allocation, enhance the stability of grassland for rocky desertification control and coordinate the regulation mechanism of grassland structure and stability. This study provided some references for grassland managers and relevant policy makers to optimize the structure and enhance the stability of grassland ecosystems. It also provided important insights to enhance the service capacity of grassland ecosystems in KDC.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a technologically innovative response to the challenges faced by agriculture due to climate change. Its implementation needs a change of mentality in the direction of an approach that takes into account how the increase in technologically induced productivity affects climate change. In the belief that the in-depth analysis conducted by scientific research plays a fundamental role, we explore the characteristics, actors, and pillars of CSA, examining both the scientific literature and financed projects. Specifically, through a systematic review of the literature we address both the application and barriers to implementation at a global level, and then we focus on a case study of the geographical distribution of CSA projects in Europe. Our results show a heterogeneous framework in which we can note discrepancies among countries. Finally, as conclusive remarks, we consider the type of policies that could be implemented to improve the diffusion of CSA in the near future.

AB  - Infrastructure plays a pivotal role in a nation's economic stability, security, and long-term sustainability. For decades, United States infrastructure has been rated as inadequate and the resources required for its restoration continue to grow. Despite the transformative potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) coupled with digital technologies in revolutionizing the building industry, its widespread adoption within infrastructure projects remains limited. This study explores the application of BIM and emerging technologies in transportation projects' lifecycle, identifies research gaps, and discusses the use of technology to address current infrastructure challenges. Employing a systematic review approach, this research synthesizes BIM application studies based on well-defined criteria. The synthesis of the literature underscores the comprehensive integration of BIM throughout the lifecycle of transportation assets, catalyzed by collaborative, information-driven processes. However, challenges pertaining to interoperability, role delineation, standards enforcement, and cost persist. This study advocates for a deeper exploration of the synergy between BIM, digital technologies, and infrastructure, envisioning an enriched transportation lifecycle in the future.

AB  - Background: Indigenous Peoples are impacted by industrial resource development that takes place on, or near, their communities. Existing literature on impacts of industrial resource development on Indigenous Peoples primarily focus on physical health outcomes and rarely focus on the mental health impacts. To understand the full range of longterm and anticipated health impacts of industrial resource development on Indigenous communities, mental health impacts must be examined. It is well-established that there is a connection between the environment and Indigenous wellbeing, across interrelated dimensions of mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.
   Methods: This paper identifies how the Community Advisory Team and a team of Indigenous and settler scholars will conduct the review. The literature search will use the OVID interface to search Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases. Non-indexed peer-reviewed journals related to Indigenous health or research will be scanned. Books and book chapters will be identified in the Scopus and PsycINFO databases. The grey literature search will also include Google and be limited to reports published by government, academic, and non-profit organizations. Reference lists of key publications will be checked for additional relevant publications, including theses, dissertations, reports, and other articles not retrieved in the online searches. Additional sources may be recommended by team members. Included documents will focus on Indigenous Peoples in North America, South America, Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, and Circumpolar regions, research that reports on mental health, and research that is based on land loss connected to dams, mines, agriculture, or petroleum development. Literature that meets the inclusion criteria will be screened at the title/abstract and full-text stages by two team members in Covidence. The included literature will be rated with a quality appraisal tool and information will be extracted by two team members; a consensus of information will be reached and be submitted for analysis.
   Discussion: The synthesized evidence from this review is relevant for land use policy, health impact assessments, economic development, mental health service planning, and communities engaging in development projects.

AB  - Along with habitat transformation, climate change has profound impacts on biodiversity and may alter ecosystem services on which human welfare depends. Many studies of the carbon cycle have focused on lowland tropical forests; however, upland forests have been less explored despite their pivotal role in carbon sequestration. Here, I synthesized the state of knowledge on the allocation of carbon in its different stocks (aboveground, belowground, and soil) as well as in its main fluxes (plant decomposition, respiration, and litterfall) in tropical upland ecosystems of the planet. In November 2020, a systematic review was carried out to identify references published from 2000 to 2020 through a combination of key terms in Google Scholar and Scopus databases, thus analysing bibliographic, geographical, methodological, and carbon cycling information of the global upland tropics (between 23.5 degrees N-23.5 degrees S). After analysing a total of 1967 references according to inclusion-exclusion criteria, 135 references published in the last 20 years were selected. Most of the studies were conducted in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest of South America. The main factors studied were elevation and forest type. Forest structure and soil variables were largely associated when studying carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Estimations of carbon stocks comprised three-fourths of the total studies, while the remaining fraction focused on carbon fluxes. Aboveground biomass and carbon in soils were highly investigated, while plant decomposition and respiration were the components that received the least attention. Even though in the last 20 years there was a slight increase in the number of studies on carbon cycle in tropical upland forests, I found bias associated with the biomes and ecoregions studied (especially in the Andes). Elevation was the main factor examined but other essential aspects such as the successional gradient, landscape management, diversity- productivity relationship, faunal and microbial effect, trophic cascades, and Gadgil effect require more attention. The inclusion of different litter species and origins (i.e. roots and stems) and theoretical frameworks including home-field advantage, substrate-matrix interaction, and phenology-substrate match may provide explanatory mechanisms to better understand litter decomposition over these forests. Despite respiration being a paramount link that is closely tied to above- and belowground compartment, this flux constitutes one of the important gaps to fulfil in future research. For a comprehensive understanding of the carbon cycle in upland forests, it is necessary to obtain information on its main fluxes and integrate them into climate change mitigation plans.

AB  - Considering the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 7, focused on "Affordable and Clean Energy", universities have the role of promoting sustainability through combining sustainable energy with the processes of knowledge transmission and research. Although sustainability at universities has been thoroughly investigated, there is a lack of comprehensiveness in identifying and categorising the university role in energy sustainability and efficiency. In this context, the aim of this paper is to perform a systematic review of the literature on this topic and relate the university role in sustainable development to its contribution to SDG 7. Using the databases ScienceDirect and Web of Science, the review resulted in an analysis of 545 articles from various perspectives, published in the last 10 years regarding energy efficiency and sustainability at universities. This enabled an improved understanding of how universities have been contributing to sustainable development in the energy context and the possibility of exploring scenarios and visions for future actions by educational institutions aiming to comply with SDG 7.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) have been urged to integrate sustainability across all their structural and organizational dimensions. A promising area of research and practice that can help to deliver this is organizational change management for sustainability. While this field has received increasing attention over the past decade, a comprehensive assessment is still lacking. Therefore, a systematic quantitative review was carried out to summarize and synthesize the academic literature on organizational change management approaches that aim to holistically embed sustainability in HEIs. Furthermore, this review aims to illustrate what change factors have been observed and how they have been analyzed, and from this highlight implications for practice and pathways for future research. The literature reviewed puts strong emphasis on change processes and human factors, as well as elements of the institutional framework, such as vision and strategy. The findings highlight the value of strategic and reflective actions, the importance of understanding and actively shaping change processes, and that change towards sustainability requires broad stakeholder input and commitment. This review serves as an important reference point for future research and practice.

AB  - A systematic review of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records of cannabis (fibres, pollen, achenes and imprints of achenes) reveals its complex history in Eurasia. A multiregional origin of human use of the plant is proposed, considering the more or less contemporaneous appearance of cannabis records in two distal parts (Europe and East Asia) of the continent. A marked increase in cannabis achene records from East Asia between ca. 5,000 and 4,000 cal bp might be associated with the establishment of a trans-Eurasian exchange/migration network through the steppe zone, influenced by the more intensive exploitation of cannabis achenes popular in Eastern Europe pastoralist communities. The role of the Hexi Corridor region as a hub for an East Asian spread of domesticated plants, animals and cultural elements originally from Southwest Asia and Europe is highlighted. More systematic, interdisciplinary and well-dated data, especially from South Russia and Central Asia, are necessary to address the unresolved issues in understanding the complex history of human cannabis utilisation.

AB  - This study presents an advanced review of policy and governance research in the context of smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI). With cities playing a crucial role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, it is vital to understand the opportunities and challenges that arise from the applications of smart technologies and AI in promoting urban sustainability. Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method based on a three-layer Bayesian algorithm model, we conducted a systematic review of approximately 3700 papers from Scopus. Our analysis revealed prominent topics such as "service transformation," "community participation," and "sustainable development goals." We also identified emerging concerns, including "open user data," "ethics and risk management," and "data privacy management." These findings provide valuable insights into the current progress and frontiers of policy and governance research in the field, informing future research directions and decision-making processes.

AB  - The goal of this review is to perform a critical analysis of the instruments used to assess executive functions (EFs) in preschool and school-age children in Brazil. We identified 37 assessment measures through a systematic review. Some performance-based tests for assessing working memory and inhibition were identified. However, there is a lack of rating measures and instruments to assess flexibility and planning in clinical practice. We observed regional differences in the performance of EFs measures. One possible explanation may be the use of normative samples from more highly-developed regions to characterize performance in less-developed regions. However, there may be alternative explanations, such as variations in the exposure to testing and the adequacy of test materials in different regions. Joint efforts among research groups should be encouraged in order to obtain normative references that are more representative of the socio-cultural diversity of the country. This improvement is essential to better understand the typical and atypical development of EFs and how the peculiarities of each country's context and culture can impact its trajectory.

AB  - Wild edible plants are extensively used worldwide to supplement food, nu-trition and medicine. To find out the present diversity status and utility pat-terns of wild edible plants (WEPs) in the biodiversity-rich Indian Eastern Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh, for the purpose of plant identifica-tion and conservation of potential species, a systematic review of publica-tions was made. A total of 662 species belonging to 340 genera and 124 fam-ilies used mostly in the form of vegetables, fruits, medicines, spices and condiments have been reported. These comprise 24 species of Pterido-phytes, 6 species of Gymnosperms and 632 species of Angiosperms. When the Angiosperms are put under APG IV classification, Eudicots dominate with 72.65%. Asteraceae represented as the dominant taxa with 36 species followed by Urticaceae, Rosaceae, Moraceae and Lamiaceae with more than 20 species in each. Based on the RFC values as well as other inputs, 50 high-ly used and preferred wild edible species having market potentiality are identified that can be included in various management practices.

AB  - There is a growing interest in decentralized wastewater treatment systems, especially in regions with water scarcity problems or water management issues. This study aims to determine whether the perceived advantages and disadvantages (leading to acceptance) of decentralized wastewater plants in such regions are the same in regions where the population is not aware of these water issues. Firstly, this study systematically reviews previous findings on public perceptions of the acceptance of decentralized wastewater treatment systems. Then, the study details the results of a focus group study to determine whether the elements identified in the literature are also relevant in a region where people are unaware of water problems. The results show that a lack of awareness of water issues seems to be a critical factor influencing acceptance. Reframing the usefulness of these systems by focusing on other aspects, such as environmental sustainability, is key.

AB  - With the outset of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0), every sector is escalating to get enrichment out of it, whether they are research- or industry-oriented. The Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry lags a bit in adopting it because of its multi-faceted dependencies and unique nature of work. Despite this, a trend has been seen recently to hone the IR 4.0 multitudes in the AEC industry. The upsurge has been seen in the usage of Immersive Technologies (ImTs) as one of the disruptive techniques. This paper studies the literature based on ImTs, which are Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) integrating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the AEC sector. A total number of 444 articles were selected from Scopus following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol of reviewing the literature. Among the selected database, 64 papers are identified as the result of following the protocol, and the articles are divided into eight domains relevant to the AEC industry, namely client/stakeholder, design exploration, design analysis, construction planning, construction monitoring, construction health/safety, facility/management, and education/training. This study adopts both a scientometric analysis for bibliometrics visualization and a critical review using Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analysis for finding gaps and state of play. The novelty of this paper lies in the analysis techniques used in the literature to provide an insight into the literature, and it provides directions for the future with an emphasis on developing sustainable development goals (SDGs). In addition, research directions for the future growth on the adoption of ImTs are identified and presented based on categorization in immersive devices, graphical/non-graphical data and, responsive/integrative processes. In addition, five subcategories for each direction are listed, citing the limitations and future/needs. This study presents the roadmap for the successful adoption of ImTs for industry practitioners and stakeholders in the AEC industry for various domains. The paper shows that there are studies on ImTs with or without BIM; however, future studies should focus on the usage of ImTs in various sectors such as modular integrated construction (MiC) or emerging needs such as SDGs.

AB  - With booming of the automobile industry, China has become the country with increasing car ownership all over the world. However, the end-of-life vehicle (ELV) recycling industry is at infancy, and there is little systematic review on ELV recycling management, as well as low adoption amongst domestic automobile industry. This study presents a literature review and an interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach is employed to identify the drivers towards Chinese ELV recycling business from government, recycling organizations and consumer's perspectives, so as to improve the sustainability of automobile supply chain by providing some strategic insights. The results derived from the ISM analysis manifest that regulations on auto-factory, disassembly technique, and value mining of recycling business are the essential ingredients. It is most effective and efficient to promote ELV recycling business by improving these attributes, also the driving and dependence power analysis are deemed to provide guidance on performance improvement of ELV recycling in the Chinese market.

AB  - The Paris Agreement put adaptation prominently on the global climate action agenda. Despite a surge in research and praxis-based knowledge on adaptation, a critical policy roadblock is synthesizing and assessing this burgeoning evidence. We develop an approach to assess the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in a robust and transparent manner, providing direction for global climate policy and identifying knowledge gaps to further future climate research. The approach, which was tested in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees C (SR1.5) to assess 23 adaptation options, is underpinned by a systematic review of recent literature, expert elicitation, and iterative peer review. It responds to the challenge of limited agreement on adaptation indicators, lack of fine-scale adaptation data, and challenges of assessing synergies and trade-offs with mitigation. The findings offer methodological insights into how future assessments such as the IPCC Assessment Report (AR) six and regional, national, and sectoral assessment exercises could assess adaptation feasibility and synthesize the growing body of knowledge on climate change adaptation.

AB  - This paper offers a systematic review of the literature of the last 15 years, which applies economic analysis and theories to the issue of combustion of solid waste. Waste incineration has attracted the interest of economists in the first place concerning the comparative assessment of waste management options, with particular reference to external costs and benefits. A second important field of applied economic research concerns the market failures associated with the provision of thermal treatment of waste, that justify some deviation from the standard competitive market model. Our analysis discusses the most robust achievements and the more controversial areas. All in all, the economic perspective seems to confirm the desirability of assigning a prominent role to thermal treatments in an integrated waste management strategy. Probably the most interesting original contribution it has to offer concerns the refusal of categorical assumptions and too rigid priority ladders, emphasizing instead the need to consider site-specific circumstances that may favor one or another solution.

AB  - The conflict that Venezuela is going through has led some of its inhabitants to decide to migrate out of the country, of which a significant portion due to its geographical proximity has been established in Colombia, which implies a series of challenges for both the citizens and the citizens. governmental estates (as it was for more than three decades and until a few years ago for the neighboring country). This process of high immigration involves activating planning mechanisms to face the demands of attention in different areas. This article addresses two priority fields in the living conditions of the inhabitants of any territory, such as health and education. In this way, in this article a balance and analysis of public policy is made regarding the integration of Venezuelan immigrants in Colombia, through a systematic review of the policies and regulations existing in the country in contrast with the indicators of the Migrant Integration Policy (MIPEX, 2015). Although the migratory phenomenon is recent, the analysis recognizes that some instances of Colombia have tried to implement an effective public policy, which contributes to an adequate integration of the Venezuelan immigrant population.

AB  - Many developing countries are facing a silent increase in deficiency of micronutrients in forage crops that results in decreased levels of essential nutrients in animals. Micronutrients are essential not only for basic metabolic processes of forage crops but also for sustaining animal health. Forage productivity and quality are severely affected by soil micronutrients deficiencies, especially zinc and copper. This review summarizes the literature highlighting the significance of different methodologies used to increase the biomass and quality of forage so as to enhance the micronutrient content of the forage crops through biofortification. Biofortification is a promising and sustainable agriculture-based strategy to reduce micronutrient deficiency in crops. The experiments and trials conducted at different locations of the world showed that copper and zinc concentrations in animal fodders can be enhanced through the process of foliar application. Additionally, agronomic biofortification showed more promising results, and thus is an outstanding, fast, and cost-effective technique for the immediate enrichment of forage in order to overcome malnutrition in animals.

AB  - The present work is a selection of empirical studies focusing on the characteristics and attitudes of Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) consumers. Using a systematic literature review approach (PRISMA), we identified five different aspects of the SFSC within the publications: producer participation, swot, state intervention, attitude and "other". Based on the findings of studies from the academic literature, the results are quite mixed. Though the number of SFSC-related empirical studies has risen in recent years, there is a lack of SFSC-related data, even in the European Union (EU), where a sustainable agriculture and food system must play a crucial role in the implementation of the Green Deal. Overall, it is hard to name those features that, without any doubt, affect the willingness of consumers to purchase from an SFSC. The studies mostly remarked on age and education; however, even these findings cannot be generalized. Therefore, some consumers of non-global food supply chains could be characterized very well, but these observations could differ in diverse cases because of local factors.

AB  - Background: Unhealthy lifestyles are a major factor in the development and exacerbation of many chronic diseases. Improving lifestyles though immersive residential experiences that promote healthy behaviours is a focus of the health retreat industry. This systematic review aims to identify and explore published studies on the health, wellbeing and economic impact of retreat experiences.
   Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases were searched for residential retreat studies in English published prior to February 2017. Studies were included if they were written in English, involved an intervention program in a residential setting of one or more nights, and included before-and-after data related to the health of participants. Studies that did not meet the above criteria or contained only descriptive data from interviews or case studies were excluded.
   Results: A total of 23 studies including eight randomised controlled trials, six non-randomised controlled trials and nine longitudinal cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 2592 participants from diverse geographical and demographic populations and a great heterogeneity of outcome measures, with seven studies examining objective outcomes such as blood pressure or biological makers of disease, and 16 studies examining subjective outcomes that mostly involved self-reported questionnaires on psychological and spiritual measures. All studies reported post-retreat health benefits ranging from immediately after to five-years post-retreat. Study populations varied widely and most studies had small sample sizes, poorly described methodology and little follow-up data, and no studies reported on health economic outcomes or adverse effects, making it difficult to make definite conclusions about specific conditions, safety or return on investment.
   Conclusions: Health retreat experiences appear to have health benefits that include benefits for people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, various cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart conditions and mental health. Future research with larger numbers of subjects and longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the health impact of different retreat experiences and the clinical populations most likely to benefit. Further studies are also needed to determine the economic benefits of retreat experiences for individuals, as well as for businesses, health insurers and policy makers.

AB  - Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) remains an Achilles heel in the licensing of mining projects on indigenous lands globally, but especially in the European North. Yet, rather than legislating on indigenous rights and CEA failures, governments tend to rely on companies to mitigate cumulative impacts through new corporate social responsibility actions. This paper considers if these voluntary actions improve companies' CEA performance and so provide grounds for indigenous communities and decision makers to trust the industry more. Findings are presented from a systematic review of corporate impact assessments for 56 mining concession permit applications on Sami lands in Sweden. We show how companies that adopt additional voluntary measures provide somewhat richer assessments. Overall, however, the performance remains poor also for 'frontrunners', with persistent lack of clarity on methods and limited analysis of consequences, social and cultural impacts and interactions with other (past, present or future) projects. We conclude that progress in voluntary actions in regard to assessing cumulative impacts has only led to cosmetic improvements in CEA performance. We therefore argue for stronger regulatory role of government and recognition of the right of indigenous communities to lead or co-manage impact assessments on their own lands.

AB  - Medicinal plants are used by local populations to treat numerous diseases, and many species are used as raw materials for the manufacture of medicines sold by the pharmaceutical industry. However, the intensive collection of these resources poses great challenges related to their conservation. Through a systematic review, we gathered information on the versatility of medicinal trees from seasonal dry forests (Caatinga) in order to create a conservation priority index (CPI) for these species. We found that demand by the pharmaceutical industry is a factor that must be taken into account when establishing conservation priorities for medicinal plants. We found that endemism was not a determining factor in the identification of priority species for conservation. The effects of extractivism on the demographics of Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. Ex DC.) Mattos, Anacardium occidentale L., and Copaifera langsdolffii Desf. populations require urgent assessment, because these species are in high demand by local communities and the pharmaceutical industry. Ecological studies may reveal strategies that should be incorporated into their management plans, which can include an increase in time between collection intervals, the production of plant nurseries, the implementation of reforestation programs, and cryopreservation, in addition to the involvement of the local community in monitoring programs. Other indicators such as the importance of species for the maintenance of ecosystem services, productivity chains, and the elaboration of public policies can be included as conservation strategies for these species.

AB  - Destination social responsibility (DSR) is a contemporary construct related to social responsibility efforts at the level of destinations rather than corporations. While DSR has become a salient topic for destinations, research approaches are still fragmented. This work discusses existing conceptualisations, followed by a systematic review. Studies have supported positive outcomes of DSR, which can be favourable towards destinations at large. Although stakeholder theory is deemed foundational in conceptualizing DSR, findings reveal the construct has been studied from the perspective of tourists or residents, whereas other stakeholders are still absent from studies. The topic is biased towards quantitative methods and settings, and a comprehensive measurement instrument and definition of DSR are called for. This review aims to outline the contribution and progress of DSR in the context of responsible tourism, propose a unifying definition of DSR, and offer avenues for future research.

AB  - Pipelines are vital for transporting oil and gas, but leaks can have serious consequences such as fires, injuries, pollution, and property damage. Therefore, preserving pipeline integrity is crucial for a safe and sustainable energy supply. The rapid progress of machine learning (ML) technologies provides an advantageous opportunity to develop predictive models that can effectively tackle these challenges. This review article mainly focuses on the novelty of using machine and deep learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs) and hybrid machine learning (HML) algorithms, for predicting different pipeline failures in the oil and gas industry. In contrast to existing noncomprehensive reviews on pipeline defects, this article explicitly addresses the application of ML techniques, parameters, and data reliability for this purpose. The article surveys research in this specific area, offering a coherent discussion and identifying the motivations and challenges associated with using ML for predicting different types of defects in pipelines. This review also includes a bibliometric analysis of the literature, highlighting common ML techniques, investigated failures, and experimental tests. It also provides in-depth details, summarized in tables, on different failure types, commonly used ML algorithms, and data resources, with critical discussions. Based on a comprehensive review aforementioned, it was found that ML approaches, specifically ANNs and SVMs, can accurately predict oil and gas pipeline failures compared to conventional methods. However, it is highly recommended to combine multiple ML algorithms to enhance accuracy and prediction time further. Comparing ML predictive models based on field, experimental, and simulation data for various pipeline failures can establish reliable and cost-effective monitoring systems for the entire pipeline network. This systematic review is expected to aid in understanding the existing research gaps and provide options for other researchers interested in predicting oil and gas pipeline failures.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of studies on CPD published between 1985 and 2018. Design/methodology/approach Before identifying common CPD, research trends were examined in terms of the number of publications in selected journals, as well as the contributions made by countries, institutions and researchers. Findings The findings reveal that researchers from developing countries have contributed the most to identifying the causes of CPD. A total of 149 causes of CPD were identified in a thorough review of 97 selected studies. Weather/climate conditions, poor communication, lack of coordination and conflicts between stakeholders, ineffective or improper planning, material shortages, financial problems, payment delays, equipment/plant shortage, lack of experience/qualification/competence among project stakeholders, labour shortages and poor site management were identified as the ten most common CPDs. Originality/value Being the first study of its type, this study provides insight into the research output related to this area and identifies a common set of CPDs, which may provide a better understanding of the key areas requiring attention where steps should be taken to minimise or control factors causing delays in construction projects.

AB  - Studies in the area of psychological empowerment have been on the rise since early 1990s. Given the large amount of information available, the researchers aim to consolidate findings, in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of the concept and its relation to job satisfaction of employees in organizations. The researchers have identified 50 studies, set in varied cultural and organizational settings. The data from these studies form the basis of the analysis in this paper. A meta-analysis of the findings of the chosen studies was conducted. This is followed by a systematic review of literature, to identify a few probable intervening variables that modify the relationship. The findings of the analysis suggest that the direct relation between psychological empowerment and job satisfaction is positive, strong and statistically significant. The study supports the validity of one of the earliest models explaining the relation. The paper establishes that the direct relation between psychological empowerment and job satisfaction is strong, positive and significant. The variations in the strength of the relationship is due to the presence of certain intervening variables like culture, age, educational qualification and experience.

AB  - One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats, and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference, including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial dataset, which included 70% of the studies, revealed that diversity in PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts; e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where the frequency of drying events increases.

AB  - Investigations within the Collaborative Research Centre 806 "Our Way to Europe: Culture-Environment Interaction and Human Mobility in the Late Quaternary" of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft led to the discovery of new sites of the Aurignacian and Magdalenian in North Rhine-Westphalia. The investigations were conducted in close cooperation with the Rhenish and Westphalian cultural heritage management as well as with numerous local history researchers. After summarising the current state of research in the region, the newly discovered sites are discussed in detail and interpreted in the context of the Aurignacian and Magdalenian settlement pattern in the area under investigation. Eventually, a systematic review of private archaeological collections almost doubled the number of known Upper Palaeolithic sites in North Rhine-Westphalia within three years. With regard to the Aurignacian and Magdalenian, the potential to discover new sites seems comparably large for the former, whereas for the latter the overall picture only changed in a minor way.

AB  - Coral reef fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people but have been severely and negatively affected by anthropogenic activities. We conducted a systematic review of published data on the biomass of coral reef fishes to explore how the condition of reef fisheries is related to the density of local human populations, proximity of the reef to markets, and key environmental variables (including broad geomorphologic reef type, reef area, and net productivity). When only population density and environmental covariates were considered, high variability in fisheries conditions at low human population densities resulted in relatively weak explanatory models. The presence or absence of human settlements, habitat type, and distance to fish markets provided a much stronger explanatory model for the condition of reef fisheries. Fish biomass remained relatively low within 14 km of markets, then biomass increased exponentially as distance from reefs to markets increased. Our results suggest the need for an increased science and policy focus on markets as both a key driver of the condition of reef fisheries and a potential source of solutions.

AB  - The development of health and healthcare systems in South-East Asia has influenced the practice of community pharmacy. Over the years, community pharmacy in the region has striven to expand services beyond dispensing to encompass more involvement in public health issues. Searches were conducted in Scopus, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for articles published between January 2000 and December 2014, with 21 studies in five countries meeting the inclusion criteria. The findings showed increasing interest in research into the delivery of pharmacy services and public health initiatives. Overall, the review found that provision of some health services in pharmacies was common; however, most public health initiatives appeared to be poorly implemented, had limited evidence and were not demonstrated to be sustainable across the sector. This indicates that the practice of community pharmacy in the region has not significantly changed over the past 14years with respect to the scope and quality of pharmacy services provided, and fundamental policy changes are necessary to improve this situation.

AB  - In this review paper, we critically examine the evidence base relating to engagement within the public sector given a wide range of public services have faced acute human resource challenges over recent years. Our review of 188 empirical studies reveals that much of the evidence focuses attention on individual and job level factors, such that specific public sector contextual contingencies have rarely been considered. Through identifying significant ?context gaps?, we present a future research agenda addressing the following key areas: i) clarifying the relationship between engagement and public service motivation, ii) further contextualizing general engagement models, iii) exploring cultural, socio-political, and institutional factors in more depth, iv) encouraging a more critical perspective on engagement, v) understanding the variation in the experience of engagement across different public services/delivery models, and vi) connecting more strongly with practical concerns and initiatives within public organizations. In presenting this agenda, we highlight how engagement and HRM scholars can more strongly embed their research within a sectoral context.

AB  - Over the past several decades, concern about loss of forest-based ecosystem services has caused all fifty states to adopt programs to lower property taxes on enrolled private forestland. Although there has been a moderate amount of research on the effectiveness of these preferential forest property tax programs (PFPTPs), most studies only assess individual states, explore perceptions without an empirical basis, or present seemingly contradictory findings. This manuscript presents a systematic review of literature to determine the strength of evidence sup-porting PFPTPs' effectiveness at retaining and also promoting active management of private forests. There is moderate evidence that PFPTPs reduce forest land-use change, parcelization, or sales, although the effect apparently is relatively weak. There is very little evidence that PFPTPs encourage more active forest manage-ment. To design a PFPTP that does more to retain forests, studies indicate that a PFPTP may need fewer re-quirements and rules, whereas to encourage active management a PFPTP may need more. Thus, greater clarity of policy goals will help determine which approach is merited.

AB  - Due to the current pressure of rural modernization and industrialization, rural areas are facing social and environmental challenges such as a lack of cultural identity, low democratic participation, and the destruction of landscape ecology, especially in China, a large and representative developing country. The nature-based solutions (NbS) approach states that achieving the multiple benefits of nature for health and well-being requires wider stakeholder collaboration and integration of nature into the policies. Although many scholars have argued that NbS have a significant positive contribution to sustainability in rural areas, there is still a lack of clear pathways for NbS to guide farmer participation and address environmental issues. This paper first summarizes the theoretical research and practical experience of stakeholder participation for NbS through a systematic review. The literature analysis is mainly conducted from five perspectives: policies, benefits, challenges, methods, and frameworks. Combined with the "farmers as the main body" principle of China's rural revitalization strategy, this study proposes to (1) stimulate farmers' awareness of environmental protection; (2) enhance farmers' participation and sense of ownership; (3) enhance farmers' ability to take action to improve the ecological environment; and (4) integrate eco-design into their lives, make environmental protection education deeply rooted in people's hearts, and cultivate green farmers.

AB  - We performed a systematic review of the evidence supporting various treatments for envenomation by jellyfish (cnidarian) and related organisms in North America and Hawaii. Our review produced 19 pertinent primary articles. Current research demonstrates variable response to treatment, often with conflicting results according to species studied, which contributes to considerable confusion about what treatment is warranted and efficacious. Our review suggests that vinegar causes pain exacerbation or nematocyst discharge in the majority of species. Hot water and topical lidocaine appear more widely beneficial in improving pain symptoms and are preferentially recommended. Unfortunately, they may be difficult to obtain at the site of envenomation, such as the beach or diving sites. In these instances, removing the nematocysts and washing the area with saltwater may be considered. If the envenomation is thought to be due to the bluebottle (Physalia), vinegar may be beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with diverse reproductive and metabolic features. It is underpinned by insulin resistance that is exacerbated by obesity. Lifestyle modification is the first line treatment in PCOS, but it is associated with lowadherence and sustainability. In small studies, metformin improves outcomes such as hyperinsulinaemia, ovulation and menstrual cyclicity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effect of lifestyle modification + metformin with lifestyle modification +/- placebo, and of metformin alone with lifestyle modification +/- placebo in PCOS on anthropometric, metabolic, reproductive and psychological outcomes.
   METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Clinical Trials registry and ANZCTR were searched for RCTs conducted on humans and published in English up to August 2014. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria (inclusive of National Institutes of Health criteria) at any age and with any BMI. Interventions of interest included lifestyle + metformin (with any dose and any duration) or metformin alone compared with lifestyle +/- placebo.
   RESULTS: Of 2372 identified studies, 12 RCTs were included for analysis comprising 608 women with PCOS. Lifestyle + metformin were associated with lower BMI (mean difference (MD) -0.73 kg/m(2), 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.14, -0.32, P = 0.0005) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (MD -92.49 cm(2), 95% CI -164.14, -20.84, P = 0.01) and increased number of menstrual cycles (MD 1.06, 95% CI 0.30, 1.82, P = 0.006) after 6 months compared with lifestyle +/- placebo. There were no differences in other anthropometric, metabolic (surrogate markers of insulin resistance, fasting and area under the curve glucose, lipids and blood pressure), reproductive (clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism), and psychological (quality of life) outcomes after 6 months between lifestyle + metformin compared with lifestyle +/- placebo. With metformin alone compared with lifestyle +/- placebo, weight and BMI were similar after 6 months, but testosterone was lower with metformin.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle + metformin is associated with lower BMI and subcutaneous adipose tissue and improved menstruation in women with PCOS compared with lifestyle +/- placebo over 6 months. Metformin alone compared with lifestyle showed similar BMI at 6 months. These results suggest the combination of lifestyle with metformin has a role to play in weight management: a key concern for women with PCOS. Existing study limitations include small sample sizes, short durations and risk of bias. With international guidelines now acknowledging that lifestyle and pharmacotherapy are required for weight loss and maintenance in obesity, future studies of appropriate size and duration are vital to clarify the role of metformin in PCOS management.

AB  - We develop and apply a systematic literature review methodology to identify and characterize the ways in which the peer-reviewed literature depicts how climate change adaptation is occurring in Australia. We reviewed the peer-reviewed, English-language literature between January 2005 and January 2018 for examples of documented human adaptation initiatives in Australia. Our results challenge previous assumptions that adaptation actions are not happening in Australia and describes adaptation processes that are underway. For the most part, actions can be described as preliminary or groundwork, with a particular focus on documenting stakeholder perspectives on climate change and attitudes towards adaptation, and modelling or scenario planning in the coastal zone, agriculture, and health sectors. Where concrete adaptations are reported, they are usually in the agricultural sector and are most common in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia's food basket. The findings of the review advance our understanding of adaptation to climate change as a process and the need to consider different stages in the process when tracking adaptation.

AB  - Although the extractive industry has contributed to the socio-economic development of many African countries, it has also led to incidences of human rights violations in many rural communities. However, the use of an evidence-based approach to search, locate, explore and synthesize the literature systematically in order to understand the nature and pattern of human rights violations within the extractive industry remains limited. Consequently, this study employs the systematic review method to determine the nature and drivers of human rights abuses within the extractive industry in Africa. Of the 791 articles retrieved from the search of the databases, 58 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in evidence synthesis. Based on the thematic analysis conducted on the articles that met the inclusion criteria, we find that human rights abuses tend to be associated with the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights, tensions over land ownership, the loss of livelihood, and community marginalization. We conclude the study with some policy implications and suggest avenues for future research.

AB  - In recent years, the demand for natural resources has increased worldwide. Given this scenario, to assess sustainability in a process, some tools were developed. Emergy Analysis is an alternative tool, which presents in its concept the list of all the energy needed for a system to produce a product/service, based on the energy consumed from its resources. Thus, a systematic literature review on Emergy Analysis in the construction industry is carried out through an analysis of articles published between 2000 and 2019. Data and information are compiled and presented, considering topics such as the number of papers published, the research institutions that investigate this issue, and the baseline adopted in previous studies. Besides, it was possible to identify that the planning and construction stages of sustainable urban projects adopt EmA and the characteristics of the main mathematical models used in this tool since due to the complexity and difficulty of interpretation of the data, it is necessary to address the assumptions of the models used, to calculate indicators of sustainability.

AB  - Finding the means to address growing environmental and social problems requires new collaborative approaches to planning that consider global resource constraints and an uncertain future. This paper presents a review of 622 articles on organizational planning approaches for achieving a sustainable future, and organizes this literature into a taxonomy of four planning approaches (predictive, adaptive, visionary, and transformational planning) and their associated planning tools or methodologies. While the most prominent theme among the reviewed literature is that transformational change is necessary to address the sustainability challenges of the future, this review identifies a lack of planning approaches that: (1) connect planning to ecological limits; (2) provide guidance for tackling the sustainability challenges in developing countries; and (3) offer guidance to private sector organizations about how to engage in broader planning debates on societal levels. From these findings, a future research agenda is proposed that examines how organizations can plan for a sustainable future, establish a fit between planning approaches, tools and sustainability challenges, adapt governance and organizational structures for transformative change, and design for and facilitate future change.

AB  - Aquaculture, especially of non-native species and translocated domestic species, is a greatly encouraged way of relieving the conflicts between food and economic demand and resource depletion. We herein summarized the introduction history of non-native fish for aquacultural use in China, including 105 species introduced from abroad and 61 species translocated domestically across river basins, which has brought great economic benefits but high ecological risks. Of these, one-fourth have successfully established wild populations in natural waters and 15% have successfully invaded. We presented specific examples of seven aquaculture species/taxa and three aquarium species/taxa to explain their outcomes. The notable economic benefits, complex species composition and strain selection of tilapias, carps and sturgeons may together facilitate their invasion, and result in fish diversity decline, genetic pollution, and loss of ecosystem service. We specifically reviewed invasion cases in lakes and reservoirs and found that lakes in western China and reservoirs made by major hydroprojects are hotspots for non-native species, and this has led to the disappearance of endemic species and changes to the original faunal composition. The escaped non-native fish introduced via aquaculture has changed the original fish biogeography, resulting in the loss of assemblage uniqueness and causing faunal homogeneity. China has achieved significant progress in completing the Aichi Targets by improving the legal system and strengthening conservational actions on controlling non-native species. Further actions, especially on risk assessment and management of non-native species are expected for a healthy outlook for the aquaculture industry of China.

AB  - Background: In Pacific Island countries and territories, the burden of road traffic injuries and their attendant risks are considered significant but are poorly quantified. As with other low and middle-income countries, understanding the epidemiology of road traffic injuries in Pacific countries is critical to informing sustainable research and policy initiatives aimed at reducing this burden.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review and critical appraisal of the relevant epidemiological literature between January 1980 and December 2010, using key search strings for incidence and aetiological studies focusing on RTIs in less resourced Pacific countries.
   Results: Nineteen studies were identified. The majority were descriptive and were unable to provide population-based estimates of the burden of road crash injury, or reliable information on risk factors using well-designed aetiological research methods. All studies were published more than 10 years ago, and all but three reported on data from Papua New Guinea, thereby limiting the generalisability of findings to the current status in the region. Studies undertaken in Papua New Guinea suggested that RTIs were more frequent among young males, with head injuries the most common cause of death or hospital admission. Two thirds of fatalities occurred at the crash site or soon after admission. Most road crash victims were passengers or pedestrians. Factors postulated to influence the risk of RTIs were travel in open-back utility vehicles, utility vehicle overcrowding, and alcohol.
   Conclusions: This review suggests that, despite increasing awareness of the importance of addressing road safety among stakeholders in less resourced Pacific Island countries, road traffic injuries have not been a research priority with little relevant current evidence from the region to inform policy. Robust epidemiological research that can assess the magnitude and key determinants of road traffic injuries in these settings is essential to determine context-specific road safety initiatives that are relevant and affordable. Greater attention to harnessing routinely collected data (e. g., hospital information systems and police crash statistics) to inform policy is also required.

AB  - The application of data analytics in urban governance is crucial in addressing municipal issues. However, there are limited sources to review and discuss research related to urban observatories, which is one of the monitoring systems implemented in an urban area. This study aims to review existing urban observatory systems around the world to understand the pattern of data analytic themes, the analysis involved and types of the data. A total of 30 urban observatories were used as secondary data as an inductive analysis of thematic content using NVIVO 12 Plus. Environmental, economic, social, physical, and global agenda are the five key data analytic themes. The finding of the study is that environmental and social data analytics were the most commonly used themes in the 30 UOs surveyed. Also, the UO system developers focused on GIS (Geographic Information System) data relating to the physical environment and land cover. While efforts are being made to improve spatial data, in advanced analysis, however, data modelling and prediction/forecasts are still lacking. In conclusion, examining existing urban observatory systems are critical to the Malaysia Urban Observatory's development. Later, MUO will assist Malaysia in tracking the trajectory of urban development and well-being of its citizens.

AB  - Through a critical review and systematic analysis of pavement life cycle assessment (LCA) studies published over the past two decades, this study shows that the available information regarding the environmental impacts of pavement infrastructure is not sufficient to determine what pavement type is more environmentally sustainable. Limitations and uncertainties related to data, system boundary and functional unit definitions, consideration of use and maintenance phase impacts, are identified as the main reasons for inconsistency of reported results in pavement LCA studies. The study outcomes also highlight the need for advancement of knowledge pertaining to: (1) utilization of performance-adjusted functional units, (2) accurate estimation of use, maintenance, and end-of-life impacts, (3) incorporation of the dynamic and uncertain nature of pavement condition performance in impact assessment; (4) development of region-specific inventory data for impact estimation; and (5) consideration of a standard set of impact categories for comparison of environmental performance of different pavement types. Advancing the knowledge in these areas is critical in providing consistent and reliable results to inform decision making toward more sustainable roadway infrastructure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere is the first global goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sus-tainable Development. Poverty eradication is a long-term process that faces many uncertainties and complex interactions with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to better understand poverty and contribute to addressing poverty and sustainability, this paper aims to conduct a systematic review of model -based poverty scenario analyses in the context of the SDGs. We first review 144 studies in terms of biblio-metrics (i.e., publication types, research topics for poverty, research objects, research scales and geographic locations) and the characteristics and scope of the models and analyses (i.e., model types, purposes, states, temporal and spatial range, sectors considered, poverty and other SDGs indicators). Second, we discuss the pros and cons of different types of models and identify seven representative models. We also discuss the synergies and trade-offs between poverty and other SDGs. Finally, we identify four potential research gaps in model-based poverty scenario analysis and provide suggestions for future research. The review shows that poverty scenario analysis was carried out mainly from a single perspective, such as economic, ecological, and agricultural. Few studies used effective models to analyze poverty in an integrated analysis of interactions between multiple sectors. Comprehensive multi-sector models are needed for global and regional poverty scenario analysis over the medium-and long-term to enhance the understanding of combined effects, synergies, and trade-offs between poverty and other SDGs.

AB  - Better water supply, sanitation and hygiene systems are among the sustainable development goals which need to be achieved by 2030. However, it is challenging for developing countries especially sub-Saharan Africa to achieve sustainable sanitation and hygiene. Thus, a systematic review has been conducted to provide a deep discussion of the current and previous works on challenges facing sanitation and hygiene sector in SSA countries. The results indicate that lack of financial resources, rapid population increase, socioeconomic disparities among the urban inhabitants, topography, lack of skilled, and experienced personnel, inadequate policies and strategies, and people's behaviours and attitudes were identified as the main constraints to sustainable sanitation and hygiene in SSA. Moreover, it recommended that SSA countries can achieve sustainable sanitation and hygiene if there are political commitments, an increase of education and awareness on sanitation to the community, and cooperation among the government, non-government organisations, civil societies, and communities in addressing the issues of sanitation. These efforts will lead to enhanced and improved sanitation and hygiene services in the SSA region.

Heifers experiencing calfhood BRD also had an average daily gain reduced by 0.067 kg/d (95% confidence interval: -0.099 to -0.034) and they produced 121.2 kg (95% confidence interval: -184.9 to -57.5) less milk during their first lactation. Other health and performance outcomes, such as age at first calving and odds of not finishing the first lactation, were also investigated but not summarized using a meta-analysis approach. Pooled estimates obtained in the present study may provide more accurate estimates of the overall economic losses associated with calfhood BRD in dairy cattle. Key words: bovine respiratory disease, heifers,
   Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most common calfhood diseases in dairy cattle. Unfortunately, published data on the short-and long-term effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance are scarce and, when available, often conflicting and uncertain. The objective of this study was therefore to review the scientific literature on the effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance of dairy cattle and summarize the research findings using a meta-analysis approach. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and CAB Abstract databases were screened for relevant studies that were published in English (until February 3, 2020). Only studies reporting naturally occurring BRD cases from birth to 12 mo of age in dairy calves in Europe and North America were considered eligible. Both observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Random-effect meta-analysis models were used to quantify the effect of BRD on outcomes for which at least 5 studies reported a numeric estimation of the effect of BRD. From an initial pool of 525 references, 27 full-text articles with original data were included in the manuscript. Meta analysis models were prepared for 4 outcomes: odds of mortality (n = 7 studies), odds of herd removal before first calving (n = 5 studies), average daily gain (n = 10 studies), and milk production during first lactation (n = 5 studies). In these models, heifers diagnosed with BRD during calfhood had 2.85 times higher odds of dying (95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 6.69) and 2.30 times higher odds of herd removal (i.e., dead, culled, or sold) before the first calving (95% confidence inter val: 1.75 to 3.03) compared with heifers not diagnosed with this condition. Heifers experiencing calfhood BRD also had an average daily gain reduced by 0.067 kg/d (95% confidence interval: -0.099 to -0.034) and they produced 121.2 kg (95% confidence interval: -184.9 to -57.5) less milk during their first lactation. Other health and performance outcomes, such as age at first calving and odds of not finishing the first lactation, were also investigated but not summarized using a meta-analysis approach.

AB  - Self-directed disability support policies aim to encourage greater choice and control for service users in terms of the health and social care they receive. The proliferation of self-directed disability support policies throughout the developed world has resulted in a growing amount of research exploring the outcomes for service users, and their families and carers. Our understanding of the issues faced by people with disabilities, particularly how they make health and social care decisions and the key areas that determine their engagement with service providers within a self-directed environment is limited. A synthesis of research is timely and can provide knowledge for service users and health and social care support providers to ensure their successful participation. A systematic review guided by the PRISMA approach explored (i) the key areas determining service users' engagement with self-directed disability services and supports, and (ii) how service users make informed decisions about providers. In October 2014 and April 2016, three databases - MEDLINE, CINAHL and Web of Science - were searched for research and review articles. Eighteen sources met the search criteria. Findings were mapped into either: key areas determining service user engagement, or service users' informed decision-making. Findings concerning key areas determining engagement fell into three themes - personal responsibility for budgeting, personalised approaches, and a cultural shift in practice and delivery among service providers. Findings about decision-making yielded two themes - supporting informed decision-making and inhibiting informed decision-making. Literature suggests that self-directed models of care may provide service users with increased control over the services that they receive. Increased control for some service users and their families requires independent external decision-making support, particularly around the domains of budgeting, planning and hiring. Future research must continue to investigate the perspectives of service users pertaining to their engagement, as their participation is central to the effectiveness of the approach.

AB  - There is an urgent need to match food production with increasing world population through identification of sustainable land management strategies. However, the struggle to achieve food security should be carried out keeping in mind the soil where the crops are grown and the environment in which the living things survive, especially under rainfed agricultural system. Rainfed agricultural ecosystem is extremely fragile, improving soil fertility and reducing greenhouse gas emission are key factors for developing sustainable agriculture. Moreover, society increasingly expects agriculture to be more sustainable, by decreasing irrigation and mineral fertilizer inputs. Increasing food production sustainably through efficient use of resources will strongly contribute to food security, sustainable agriculture development, and increased climate change resilience. This paper addresses the effects of carbon smart technologies on greenhouse gas emission, soil quality and crop productivity in rainfed agro ecological environment. This paper hypothesized that application of carbon smart technologies could improve soil physical and chemical properties to enhance GHG mitigation and crop production. Carbon smart technologies highlighted in this paper include minimum tillage, crop residue retention, agroforestry, biofuels, integrated nutrient management and land use management systems. This paper review and discusses the work done on carbon smart technologies in different agro-ecological regions so as to understand its impact from the perspectives of the soil, the crop and the environment. The impact of conservation agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions and the underlying mechanism in different agroecological environments have been discussed. A detailed case study and tremendous advancements on the strength of integration of trees and shrub as carbon smart technologies in improving soil and crop productivity is highlighted immensely. The paper concludes with recommendations for encouraging and improving adoption by smallholder farmers to ensure more efficient and sustainable food system. This systematic review will primarily contribute to the achievement of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG5 (Gender equality) and SDG13 (Climate action).

AB  - Over the last decade, the potential of nature-based solutions (NBS) has been recognized to support climate change adaptation, by promoting sustainable urban planning. Nevertheless, a wider uptake of such solutions in urban areas faces different challenges and barriers. A comprehensive mapping of available NBS impact assessment methods could help to accelerate this process. There is, however, a lack of comprehensive systematization of economic analysis. This research aims to provide an overview of NBS impact evaluations by assessing how the scientific literature integrates such economic analysis into urban planning adaptation. A systematic review approach has been used to discuss the role of NBS in climate change adaptation. This review presents two main stages. Firstly, it identifies the biophysical-economic assessment of NBS adaptation measures to reduce urban flood extremes in coastal cities. Secondly, the NBS approaches were categorized based on the biophysical benefits (in terms of flood-risk reduction) related to each specific solution and the subsequent economic evaluation of such implementations. This research review revealed a low-level gap of integration between climate change issues and NBS analysis (i.e., it is commonly used as background condition). Most publications provide NBS biophysical impacts assessment, without combining these results with economic evaluation of the flood damages to finally achieve the avoided cost due to the implementation of such solutions. This work shows the growing interest on further research to develop spatially integrated environmental-economic assessment of NBS implementation, by highlighting the needs and opportunities of a trans-disciplinary approach to support policy-making in the framework of urban climate change adaptation.

AB  - Climate change is adversely affecting coffee production, impacting both yields and quality. Coffee production is dominated by the cultivation of Arabica and Robusta coffee, species that represent 99% of production, but both will be affected by climate change. Sustainable management practices that can enhance the resilience of production and livelihoods to climate change are urgently needed as production supports the livelihoods of over 25 million people globally, the majority of whom are smallholder farmers located in the coffee belt spanning the tropics. These communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. We conducted a systematic review, identifying 80 studies that describe the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on coffee agroecosystems, or that identify agroecological practices with the potential to enhance climate resilience. Adverse environmental impacts include a reduction in area suitable for production, lower yields, increased intensity and frequency of extreme climate events, and greater incidence of pests and diseases. Potential environmental solutions include altitudinal shifts, new, resilient cultivars, altering agrochemical inputs, and agroforestry. However, financial, environmental and technical constraints limit the availability of many of these approaches to farmers, particularly smallholder producers. There is therefore an urgent need to address these barriers through policy and market mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement to continue meeting the growing demand for coffee.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food allergy remains a common problem and a lifelong condition for many children. In recent years, food allergy management has increasingly involved conversations about food oral immunotherapy (OIT). Although ethical considerations of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice implicitly inform these conversations, applying these principles can be complex, particularly in young children. Families of young children assume a role of surrogate decision-maker and must balance immediate risks with the hope of longer-term benefits. OBJECTIVE: To explore implementation of OIT in children through an ethical lens.METHODS: To evaluate OIT through an ethical lens, we conducted a literature search to explore currently published frameworks in this area. RESULTS: Evaluation of the harm principle, the basic interest principle, and the best interest principle of parental decision-making can be informative. Shared decision-making continues to be central to the process of engaging with patientefamily units to individualize the best care, at the right time, and minimize decisional discord. Although OIT is well-positioned to promote health and well-being, challenges to equity, sustainability, and organizational support must be considered to improve access for appropriate patients.

AB  - Energy efficiency has been the subject of discussion throughout the world, not only for optimization of process costs, but also by some crises identified in the energy matrix. On this context, a research agenda for energy efficiency can take assist effect in finding solutions to reduce energy consumption (or smart consumption) in industrial environments. Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to create a research agenda for energy efficiency in industrial environments, using, for this, systematic review of the literature as a fundamental methodology in the search for material that could enhance our understanding of the subject under study, identifying relevant texts to it. Once selected a portfolio of reading, it was possible to outline a statistical look around the literature, proposing indicators for analysis, as authors, countries, institutions, journals, keywords and topics and the development of the research agenda with major authors, themes and magazines. A research agenda on energy efficiency can be the start point for the studies of management practices focused on efficient use of energy. In this study, however, was limited to work only eitgh databases, given the importance in the engineering area.

AB  - Today cities face the increasing negative consequences of the unsustainable course society is set on. Climate change, biodiversity loss and increasing spatial segregation are testament to this. The effects of these issues often exceed the coping capacity of individual urban housing developers. Thus, an antidote to the current neoliberal trend must be found in collaborations such as public-private partnerships (PPP). Here the shortcomings and limitations of PPP and its potential ability to solve the problem of unsustainable urban development are investigated. Using the Doughnut Economics (DE) model as a general guide, a systematic literature review is conducted. The results reveal evidence that PPPs are unjust and exclude local actors from collaborations. Hence, resident participation and inclusion is considered the best strategy for PPP to evolve as a future guarantor of the sustainable city. First, however, major differences in the character of issues that connect the global model of sustainability to the harsh reality of the local context need to be addressed. This gap concerns the city's social foundation and ecological ceiling. The DE model applied herein is an excellent tool to test the scope and depth of local collaborations such as PPPs and reflect on international treaties such as SDGs.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the cur-rent pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accu-mulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projec-tions.In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthe-sis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluat-ing current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications.Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers.The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.(c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background It is essential to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions to women affected by armed conflict, but there is a lack of evidence on effective approaches to delivering such interventions in conflict settings. This review synthesised the available literature on SRH intervention delivery in conflict settings to inform potential priorities for further research and additional guidance development. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and SRH. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing an SRH intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was undertaken. Results 110 publications met our eligibility criteria. Most focused on sub-Saharan Africa and displaced populations based in camps. Reported interventions targeted family planning, HIV/STIs, gender-based violence and general SRH. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics by doctors and nurses. Delivery barriers included security, population movement and lack of skilled health staff. Multistakeholder collaboration, community engagement and use of community and outreach workers were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. Discussion There is limited relevant literature on adolescents or out-of-camp populations and few publications reported on the use of existing guidance such as the Minimal Initial Services Package. More interventions for gender-based violence were reported in the grey than the indexed literature, suggesting limited formal research in this area. Engaging affected communities and using community-based sites and personnel are important, but more research is needed on how best to reach underserved populations and to implement community-based approaches.

AB  - Oceans and coasts provide important ecosystem, livelihood, and cultural values to humans and the planet but face current and future compounding threats from anthropogenic activities associated with expanding pop-ulations and their use of and reliance on these environments. To respond to and mitigate these threats, there is a need to first systematically understand and categorise them. This paper reviewed 226 articles from the period 2010-2020 on threats to Australia's oceans and coasts, resulting in the identification of a total of 307 threats. Threats were grouped into three broad categories - threats from use and extraction; environmental and human -induced threats; and policy and socio-political threats -then ranked by frequency. The most common 'threats from use and extraction' were recreational activities, non-point source pollution, and urban development; the most common 'environmental and human-induced threat' was increased temperatures; and the most common 'policy and socio-political threat' was policy gaps and failures (e.g., a lack of coastal climate adaptation policies). The identification of threats across all three categories increased over time; however, the identification of 'threats from use and extraction' increased most rapidly over the last four years (2017-2020). Threats were most often described for their impacts on environmental values (68%), followed by economic (14%), socio-cultural (12%), and Indigenous (6%) values. Only 45 of the 226 papers (20%) discussed multiple threats. The threats facing Australia's oceans and coasts are rising, cumulative, and multi-faceted, and the inherent tensions between varied uses, along with intensification of uses that derive short-term anthropogenic benefit, will continue to degrade the ecological sustainability of ocean and coastal systems if actions are not taken.

AB  - The combined effects of natural, anthropogenic, and socioeconomic factors have resulted in significant transformations of land use and landscape pattern in global mountains over the past two centuries, but related studies typically focus on local and regional scales, and analyses on global scale are lacking. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review of land use and landscape patterns evolution in mountains by selecting relevant case studies to investigate the characteristics and trends at the global scale. The results show that (1) land use change in mountains is different from the global general trend, and there is a bidirectional variation relationship between forest land and agricultural land in global mountains. (2) Land use in mountains roughly experiences the natural period, agricultural expansion period, transition period, and polarization period. The corresponding landscape pattern evolution is reflected in natural mountain landscape, traditional mountain landscape, transitional mountain landscape and modern mountain landscape. (3) Due to disparities in socioeconomic development, different mountain regions are in different stages of land use and landscape pattern evolution at the same time. (4) There are two opposite trends in recent decades of land use and landscape pattern transformation in global mountains. On the positive trend, land use is polarized, and the landscape pattern has distinct heterogeneity in vertical space. On the reverse trend, the mountain landscape pattern is represented by the traditional mountain landscape of the agricultural expansion period. Overall, the results reveal the uniqueness of land use and landscape pattern transformation in global mountains, which has enlightenment for the global sustainable land use.

AB  - Floodplains provide ecosystem services (ES). Their evaluation is complex and integrative assessment remains challenging for sciences and practices. Studies have been published in the last two decades reporting ES monetary values of floodplains. Since ES are site-specific, we focus on those studies regarding the Europe's second largest river basin, namely the Danube River Basin (DRB). By analyzing these studies, we aim to answer the questions: "Do the significant predictor variables differ from previous meta-analyses?" and "Does the spatial database improve the meta analysis?" In this context, we conducted a systematic review on Scopus and Web of Science combining the four themes "value", "ES", "floodplain", and "location". We conducted a meta-analysis of the Danube floodplains' ES values with different sub-groups based on the ES classes (provisioning, regulating, and cultural) and implemented model selection based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. We selected 251 entries from 25 studies to set up with a PostgreSQL spatial database, which provides limitless possibilities to enrich the information on the study areas. We observed that the most important variables to describe ES values of DRB floodplains depend on the ES class, but in general the area proportions of water bodies and riparian landscapes are important, together with the valuation method and the chemical or ecological status of the corresponding river section. Finally, we provided two versions of unconditional benefit-transfer functions to evaluate provisioning, regulating, and cultural ES. This paper complements previously conducted meta-analyses to recognize significant characteristics to value ES and it is a valid basis to help determine the ES value of Danube floodplains.

AB  - Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are often considered major improvements in the capability of certain areas in sustainability accounting research. As such, it is argued that blockchains could be used for validation, data management, transactions settlements and objective measurement for corporate sustainability indicators, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions during production processes. Following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in data collection and database formation, the current work provides an analysis of the existing literature consisting of 59 contributions on blockchain applications in sustainability accounting. Several analysis steps containing bibliometric analyses were performed and presented, including novel coding of methodologies and industrial applications. Additionally, text mining analysis of the meta-data of contributions was conducted for the purpose of topic generation and retrieval of comparative insights. Results provide insights into the mapping of baseline technologies, regulatory environment, and practical factors outlined by previous contributions that influence the applications of blockchains for this cause. Future research areas include blockchains paired with other future-proof technologies, such as digital accounting tools (e.g. XBRL) or hardware IoT technologies in smart factories, to aid in the development of new pipelines of measurable and traceable sustainability information.

AB  - Tropical peatlands in Indonesia have attracted international and domestic attention and concern in recent decades. Indonesian peatlands provide globally significant climate regulation and biodiversity provisioning ecosystem services and are central to the lives of local communities, yet they have undergone significant degradation via drainage and fire. There is a growing call for scientific knowledge of the social, environmental and practice dimensions of peatland restoration in Indonesia. This Special Volume of Mires and Peat is a collaborative effort by an Indonesian and Australian team of biophysical and social scientists to showcase primary research and systematic reviews that engage with the complexity of tropical peatland fire, conservation and restoration in Indonesia. We explore lives above ground (people and plants) and below ground (microbes, plants and the dynamic peat itself) and identify the following four themes that cut across the individual articles: 1) Livelihoods and land use; 2) Community engagement; 3) Bringing together multiple knowledges; and 4) Carbon; and draw out globally applicable lessons. We suggest that these themes highlight future directions for research which engage with the complexity of tropical peatland restoration in Indonesia, while centring the voices of local communities to support equity and sustainability in the transition to rewet peatlands.

AB  - Historic gardens are important parts of humanity's built heritage within the designed landscape, providing many environmental, economic and socio-cultural benefits. Management is a key part of their conservation, perhaps the most difficult because it is costly, must be continual, and requires a skilled workforce. This systematic review looks at the literature addressing historic garden management, with special attention regarding the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. Academic studies on this subject come from many different disciplines, making it both stimulating and fragmented. It is now time to consolidate these interdisciplinary efforts into a clear vision, including a framework of key themes and research methods so as to better coordinate efforts and make the information and innovation generated more accessible to the garden managers "in the trenches". With this aim, reviewed studies are classified according to 10 criteria: supply or demand orientation; management phase involved; primary sustainability processes addressed; geographic criteria; number of sites covered; policy documents referred to; kind of data collected; study methods employed; possibility of bias specifically regarding historic gardens; garden use. An analysis of these criteria shows that historic garden management literature focuses on describing the gardens themselves, with few studies interested in the people supporting them. Future research should follow recent policy documents' lead and pay more attention to community value and involvement.

AB  - Gully erosion is a formidable land degradation process globally. It is omnipresent across India, wherein two of the largest badlands regions in the world also exist. However, despite being affected by widespread gullying, gully erosion research in India has been rather limited, with key aspects of gully formation, morphologies and dynamics remaining unknown. Through this comprehensive systematic review, we synthesise previous studies on gully erosion in India and in turn highlight pivotal knowledge gaps. The review starts with a discussion of the causal factors of gullying in India, which underlines how gully initiation in several regions was an aftermath of deforestation and overgrazing. Contrastingly, the badlands of Central and Western India have mainly developed in response to natural triggers like neotectonics and Holocene climate change. The section on mapping highlights how mapping methodologies have not only been dictated by the availability of imagery and/or means of data processing, but also the mapping purpose-that is, individual gully channels or entire badlands. Although a few studies applying concepts of fractal geometry to characterise badlands' geomorphology are innovative and unique, the most striking research gaps we have identified also pertain to understanding and quantification of gully geomorphology and erosion dynamics in different regions of India. Our review reveals that gullies of peninsular India have been the least studied, followed by those of the Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan region. Although the literature provides interesting examples of linkages between badlands development and the wider geomorphic evolution of the landscape, better chronological understanding is required to disentangle the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic drivers of landscape change in India's badlands. Large-scale mapping of gully characteristics, quantification of gully morphologies, gully erosion rates and its share in catchment sediment budget across various physiographic regions or river basins of the country also constitute important areas for future research.

AB  - Despite the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by lotic ecosystems, they are strongly affected by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, biological monitoring and assessment strategies are crucial in helping maintain these ecosystems and developing mitigation policies. We provide a global overview of the use of benthic diatoms as bioindicators in lotic environments, by analyzing 764 articles published in the past 20 years. We analyzed the influence of substrate type on samplings, which species have been highlighted as indicators and for which type of impacts, which anthropogenic impacts have been most commonly evaluated, and which metrics have been commonly used in studies using diatoms to assess and monitor the quality of lotic environments. We found that the most studied anthropogenic impact is artificial eutrophication and that some species, especially Nitzschia palea, have been thoroughly mentioned as indicators of this impact. Indicator species related to other types of impact are less common, demonstrating the need for studies on this issue. Moreover, we verified that traditional taxonomic metrics, such as diversity and diatom indices, have been widely used. Some alternative metrics have been used recently, such as those based on teratological valves, lipid bodies, valve size, and DNA metabarcoding. The number of biomonitoring and assessment studies based on diatoms has increased considerably in the past 20 years. Nonetheless, the demand for natural resources and consequently the degradation of lotic ecosystems have accelerated significantly. Thus, the development of low-cost and time-efficient biological assessment and monitoring strategies is essential for evaluating the health of lotic environments.

AB  - The densely populated ecologically sensitive mountain region of the Himalayas under Asian developing country India, popularly regarded as Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), attracts millions of tourists and provides multiple ecosystem services. Yet, the progress and contribution of IHR in mountain-tourism remains relatively unknown due to a lack of integrated approaches. To understand the status and development of IHR-tourism and research and how they are interconnected, we employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract relevant studies. Integration of quantitative and qualitative analyses successfully presented in-depth profiling of topical, thematic, methodological and bibliometric trends from 105 past studies. The findings show that uneven, centralized and unrestricted tourism development has already interrupted the human environmental balance in Western-IHR. Spatiotemporal research development reveals similar biases towards the Western-counterpart (81% studies; 51% in Uttarakhand). In comparison, similar possibilities of tourism-induced threats in the potential Eastern-counterpart remain completely unattended. Surprisingly, contemporary issues such as climate-change and water crisis are rarely linked with human induced issues of increasing population pressure. In addition, lack of multidisciplinary, impactful and advanced research practices restricts the exposure of the latest discoveries and facts on IHR-tourism. The contributions and shares of IHR in Asian tourism and the research domain are gradually falling behind similar mountain regions. Therefore, this SLR-investigation has raised important questions digging into existing research-gaps, highlighted the theoretical and managerial implications and directs the future pathways concerning the present state of relative underdevelopment in IHR. These finding also interconnect and contribute to multiple disciplines and international collaborations concerned with the sustainability of mountain-tourism.

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Although it might adversely impact all of the world in varying magnitudes, tropical biodiversity is expected to be impacted the most. Central and South America (CSA) is among the most biodiverse regions in the world, housing several important areas for conservation due to high levels of diversity and endemism. Thus, because of its disproportionate tropical biodiversity, CSA might be severely vulnerable to climate change in the future. We performed a systematic review to assess how risk projections varied for different aspects of biodiversity in CSA, and the potential benefits of limiting climate change. We evaluated 71 scientific papers, amounting to > 3000 risk projections in the priority areas for conservation in CSA. CSA houses some of the most studied richspots in the world, with a strong bias towards the Atlantic Forest, Mesoamerica and Cerrado hotspots. Our results indicate that up to 85% of risk projections predict negative impacts, with 26% of projections predicting species extinctions. While high emissions scenarios indicate severe adverse impacts for biodiversity in CSA, noteworthy risk reduction arose from mitigation. Considering a climate change mitigation scenario in line with the Paris Agreement, risks for the region could be substantially reduced by over 80%. However, for endemic species, which are predicted to be the most impacted by climate change in CSA, mitigation alone will not suffice to minimize climatic risks. This highlights the urgent need of adaptation measures to increase the resilience of natural systems in the CSA to climate change.

AB  - Urban forests provide direct and indirect benefits to human well-being that are increasingly captured in residential property values. Remote Sensing (RS) can be used to measure a wide range of forest and vegetation parameters that allows for a more detailed and better understanding of their specific influences on housing prices. Herein, through a systematic literature review approach, we reviewed 89 papers (from 2010 to 2022) from 21 different countries that used RS data to quantify vegetation indices, forest , tree parameters of urban forests and estimated their influence on residential property values. The main aim of this study was to understand and provide insights into how urban forests influence residential property values based on RS studies. Although more studies were conducted in developed (n = 55, 61.7%) than developing countries (n = 34, 38.3%), the results indicated for the most part that increasing tree canopy cover on property and neighborhood level, forest size, type, greenness , proximity to urban forests increased housing prices. RS studies benefited from spatially explicit repetitive data that offer superior efficiency to quantify vegetation, forest, and tree parameters of urban forests over large areas and longer periods compared to studies that used field inventory data. Through this work, we identify and underscore that urban forest benefits outweigh management costs and have a mostly positive influence on housing prices. Thus, we encourage further discussions about prioritizing reforestation and conservation of urban forests during the urban planning of cities and suburbs, which could support UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urban policy reforms.

AB  - Opportunities exist for adoption of precision agriculture technologies in all parts of the world. The form of precision agriculture may vary from region to region depending on technologies available, knowledge levels and mindsets. The current review examined research articles in the English language on precision agriculture practices for increased productivity among smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 7715 articles were retrieved and after screening 128 were reviewed. The results indicate that a number of precision agriculture technologies have been tested under SSA conditions and show promising results. The most promising precision agriculture technologies identified were the use of soil and plant sensors for nutrient and water management, as well as use of satellite imagery, GIS and crop-soil simulation models for site-specific management. These technologies have been shown to be crucial in attainment of appropriate management strategies in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of resource use in SSA. These technologies are important in supporting sustainable agricultural development. Most of these technologies are, however, at the experimental stage, with only South Africa having applied them mainly in large-scale commercial farms. It is concluded that increased precision in input and management practices among SSA smallholder farmers can significantly improve productivity even without extra use of inputs.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to research, identify and discuss the benefits and overall role of big data and artificial intelligence (BDAI) in the tourism sector, as this is depicted in recent literature.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic literature review was conducted under the McKinsey's Global Institute (Talwar and Koury, 2017) methodological perspective that identifies the four ways (i.e. project, produce, promote and provide) in which BDAI creates value. The authors enhanced this analysis methodology by depicting relevant challenges as well.
   Findings
   The findings imply that BDAI create value for the tourism sector through appropriately identified disseminations. The benefits of adopting BDAI strategies include increased efficiency, productivity and profitability for tourism suppliers combined with an extremely rich and personalized experience for travellers. The authors conclude that challenges can be bypassed by adopting a BDAI strategy. Such an adoption will stand critical for the competitiveness and resilience of existing established and new players in the tourism sector.
   Originality/value
   Besides identifying the benefits that BDAI brings in the tourism sector, the research proposes a guidebook to overcome challenges when introducing such new technologies. The exploration of the BDAI literature brings important implication for managers, academicians and consumers. This is the first systematic review in an area and contributes to the broader e-commerce marketing, retailing and e-tourism research.

AB  - Purpose As global concerns for sustainability have gained traction in all sectors of every economy including agribusiness, the need to investigate the critical barriers that could hamper this novelty has also risen. In that regard, this study presents a comprehensive overview of the dominant barriers encountered by agribusinesses to ensure long-term success through the lenses of a literature review. Design/methodology/approach The study used a systematic literature review (SLR) of 43 relevant articles. The study applies content analysis to identify and analyze the selected articles. The conceptual framework underlines the three principal barriers to sustainable agribusinesses. Findings The results from the SLR demonstrates that inadequate financial support, excessive post-harvest loss, gender inequality, non-climate-smart policies and weak institutional controls constitute the major challenges to the sustainability of agribusinesses. Research limitations/implications The study is limited in scope to barriers to the sustainability of agribusiness only not the broad spectrum of the concept of agriculture. Originality/value This study's uniqueness is twofold. First, it provides a checklist for practice with the goal of addressing problems that hamper the sustainability of agribusinesses. Second, the findings and research gaps in this study are important to support future studies.

AB  - One of the major environmental challenges faced by the aviation industry is the sustainable management of solid waste at airports. Rising passenger volumes and expansion of airport activities have considerably increased the types and quantities of waste generated at airports. With many regional and national governments emphasizing on waste diversion from landfills, numerous airports are gradually transitioning to sustainable alternatives. Despite being a pressing issue, there is limited literature on waste management initiatives and their efficiency at airports. This has become more vital since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has had a significant impact on the generation and management of wastes, especially at airports. This article conducts a systematic review of the various aspects of airport waste management, viz. the types and sources of wastes generated, the management practices adopted for the different waste streams, and the associated challenges. The waste generation trends and management models at different airports have been explored to develop a knowledge base for decision-makers and policy analysts. The article also identifies potential challenges lying ahead for the aviation industry with respect to waste management post-COVID-19.

AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, the silvopastoral system has always been part of the regional economy. Silvopastoral areas contribute significantly to the development of the ecological and socio-economic factors of territorial sustainability. However, little attention has been paid to reviewing the importance, historical evolution, socio-economic conditions, and climate change impact of the southern Mediterranean region of northern Morocco. This review casts light on research on the silvopastoral systems in Morocco with a focus on the Mediterranean side. Sixty-nine peer-reviewed publications were selected for this systematic review. The findings revealed that silvopastoral areas play a very important role in animal feeding in Morocco. Animals are managed traditionally on these woodlands where they graze throughout the year. The silvopastoral system has undergone several changes over recent decades. These changes have had a direct impact on ecosystems, causing a decline in biodiversity, forest degradation, and an increase in land use at the expense of silvopastoral areas, mainly in the Mediterranean region of northern Morocco. Consequently, the sustainability of the silvopastoral systems would undoubtedly be negatively affected. The review finishes with some crucial strategies and propositions that could be encouraged to support sustainable management actions of silvopastoral resources. In the conclusion, we outline the need to assess the realistic socio-economic and ecological benefits of silvopastoral systems to promote their sustainable development.y

AB  - The energy sector plays a crucial role in addressing the global challenges of achieving sustainability by using renewable energy sources as well as by increasing energy efficiency and conservation while gaining energy security and safety. Choosing an appropriate research method to investigate the energy sector's management has become more complex, involving multiple factors such as technical, environmental, social, political and economic. Additionally, considering the important role of energy in modern society, it is imperative to study the current methods used in examining the energy sector and to create an appropriate theory of the managing energy sector enterprises in the future. The main purpose of this review paper is to explore which research methods and approaches are utilized by researchers studying the issues of the managing energy sector enterprises. This article presents a systematic review based on a qualitative synthesis of the accessible publications from the Scopus database. In this review, which also adhered to strict search and filter criteria, a total of 77 articles were selected and synthesized. The selected papers met the inclusion criteria and a bibliometric visualization approach was applied using MAXQDA2020 software. The present paper reveals existing research trends in utilizing various research approaches in the energy sector from the perspective of management sciences in the last ten years and also provides future research avenues in the discussed area of knowledge.

AB  - Purpose There is a significant dearth of theoretical and practical knowledge with respect to the design and planning stages of post-conflict housing reconstruction projects. This research presents the development of a conceptual framework towards improving the design and planning processes of post-conflict housing reconstruction projects. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature on post-conflict housing reconstruction in developing countries, incorporating the themes of collaboration and stakeholder engagement, is presented. A synthesis of this literature is used to inform the development of a conceptual framework that seeks to address the limitations of current housing reconstruction models in post-conflict environments by establishing collaborative approaches at the initial stages of design, as well as the tasks required to achieve efficient results through the aid of relief organisations (NGOs). Findings While the review essentially identifies the fundamental issues and inadequacies of the current housing reconstruction models, the proposed framework aims to enable the implementation of better and efficient collaborative design and planning strategies and practices in post-conflict housing reconstruction. Originality/value The conceptual framework aims to promote more effective collaboration through the design of post-conflict housing reconstruction projects by strengthening communication and coordination between the key stakeholders. Furthermore, the research highlights several gaps in the extant literature, signposting new directions for future research in the area of stakeholder engagement during the design and planning post-conflict housing.

AB  - To leverage agriculture's potential to better benefit both people and nature, policymakers need clear messages about which farming practices positively impact biodiversity and yields, and when trade-offs arise. Existing reviews analyse effects of dif-ferent agricultural practices on either biodiversity or yield, without considering interactions. Here, we applied multinomial and quantile regression models to synthesize global evidence of synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and yield, using 764 paired observations (from 43 studies across 18 countries) comparing diversified and simplified farming systems. Results show that farmland diversification led to win-win outcomes for biodiversity and yield in 23% of cases, while a win for biodiversity coupled with a loss in yield was the most likely outcome (28% of cases). Yield and biodiversity responses were negatively cor-related, meaning that diversifying farming systems solely in pursuit of production goals is unlikely to lead to markedly better outcomes for biodiversity, or vice-versa. Yet certain situations made win-win significantly more likely, including when crop and animal production, or multiple diversification practices (e.g., intercropping and cover crops), were combined, when no agrochemicals were applied, when diversification occurred in temperate climates, and when diversification enhanced below -ground taxa. Win-win was also more likely than lose-lose when biodiversity was measured as richness or richness-evenness, but not abundance, suggesting that in certain contexts diversified farming can effectively enhance species diversity while increasing agricultural yields. Overall, crop commodity group and bioclimatic location were amongst the most important con-textual factors influencing the likelihood of a synergy or trade-off between biodiversity and yield, and diversification that accounts for these is less likely to lead to unexpected outcomes. Our novel method and up-to-date review show that farmland diversification frequently leads to better outcomes for biodiversity and/or agricultural production when compared to monocul-tures and farmland stripped of natural vegetation, opening a pathway to more sustainable agricultural production.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Mountains are home to a considerable share of the human population. Around a billion people live in mountainous areas, which harbor rich natural and sociocultural diversity. Today, many people living in mountainous areas worldwide face fundamental changes to their cultural and economic living conditions. At the same time, mountain communities have defied harsh environments in the past by adapting to changing natural conditions and showing remarkable levels of resilience. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of English-language scientific literature on resilience-related topics in mountain areas based on a systematic review of the Scopus((R)) literature database. We propose a structured starting point for science-practice interactions and concrete action-based activities to support livelihoods and strengthen resilience in mountain areas. We suggest that existing knowledge gaps can be addressed by relying on local knowledge and cocreating solutions with communities. In this way, we can build innovative capacity and actively buffer against the impact of crises while supporting deliberate transformation toward sustainability and regeneration to further enhance resilience.

AB  - This review examines supply chain risk publications across nine prestigious management, operations, and supply chain journals with respect to exploring trends and emerging topics. Using a refined set of keywords, we extract and filter the most relevant supply chain risk management (SCRM) articles from Scopus between 2001 and 2019. Unlike previous reviews of the SCRM literature, our methodology utilizes both bibliometric and cocitation analyses of publications in selective management and operations and supply chain management journals. In addition to analyzing the current state of the SCRM literature via bibliometric analysis, we delve deeply into the clusters of literature informing SCRM studies through a cocitation analysis. By conducting a text analysis on these clusters, we identify the main themes and provide insights regarding article relevance, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies for each cluster. In addition, we categorize the themes within each cluster into three main groups of matured, developing, and emerging. Based on the identified categories, we provide detailed discussions on the promising avenues for research and practice in three main areas of sustainable SCRM, behavioral SCRM, and nascent methodologies and theories in SCRM studies. Finally, we dedicate a section in our review to discussing the direction of SCRM research during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 era.

AB  - In situations of uncertainty, people often make decisions with heuristic shortcuts or decision rules, rather than using computational or logical methods such as optimizing their behavior based on specific goals. The high level of uncertainty and complexity involved in adapting to climate change suggests that heuristics would be commonly used in this context rather than more structured decision methods. Through a systematic review of 137 articles, from 2007-2017 we explore the behavioral and cognitive assumptions used to examine agricultural decision-making related to climate change among farmers in developing countries. We find a strong orientation toward modeling behavior and decision making as a rational utility-maximizing process, despite decades of research demonstrating the prevalence of simpler heuristic choice when facing uncertainty and real-world constraints. Behavioral and cognitive approaches can increase our ability to predict or explain decisions being made in this realm, particularly in terms of how we understand decision making around information processing and risk assessment. In the following review, we highlight articles that have contributed to developing a more realistic decision-making framework for studying this problem on the ground. While there is a burgeoning literature using psychological insights to examine decision making under climate uncertainty, few studies consider the prevalence of simple heuristics, the presence of cognitive biases, and the salience of climate relative to other risk factors.

AB  - Through a systematic review of publications in reputed peer-reviewed journals, this paper investigates the role of blockchain technology in sustainable supply chain management. It uses the What, Who, Where, When, How, and Why (5W+1H) pattern to formulate research objectives and questions. The review considers publications since 2015, and it includes 187 papers published in 2017, 2018, 2019, and the early part of 2020, since no significant publications were found in the year 2015 or 2016 on this subject. It proposes a reusable classification framework-emerging technology literature classification level (ETLCL) framework-based on grounded theory and the technology readiness level for conducting literature reviews in various focus areas of an emerging technology. Subsequently, the study uses ETLCL to classify the literature on our focus area. The results show traceability and transparency as the key benefits of applying blockchain technology. They also indicate a heightened interest in blockchain-based information systems for sustainable supply chain management starting since 2017. This paper offers invaluable insights for managers and leaders who envision sustainability as an essential component of their business. The findings demonstrate the disruptive power and role of blockchain-based information systems. Given the relative novelty of the topic and its scattered literature, the paper helps practitioners examining its various aspects by directing them to the right information sources.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are smart tools to deal with numerous criteria in decision-making. These methods have been widely applied in the area of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) because of their computational capabilities. This paper conducts a systematic literature review on MCDM methods applied in different areas of SSCM. From the literature search, a total of 106 published journal articles have been selected and analyzed. Both individual and integrated MCDM methods applied in SSCM are reviewed and summarized. In addition, contributions, methodological focuses, and findings of the reviewed articles are discussed. It is observed that MCDM methods are widely used for analyzing barriers, challenges, drivers, enablers, criteria, performances, and practices of SSCM. In recent years, studies have focused on integrating more than one MCDM method to highlight methodological contributions in SSCM; however, in the literature, limited research papers integrate multiple MCDM methods in the area of SSCM. Most of the published articles integrate only two MCDM methods, and integration with other methods, such as optimization and simulation techniques, is missing in the literature. This review paper contributes to the literature by analyzing existing research, identifying research gaps, and proposing new future research opportunities in the area of sustainable supply chain management applying MCDM methods.

AB  - Social learning can influence how animals respond to anthropogenic changes in the environment, determining whether animals survive novel threats and exploit novel resources or produce maladaptive behaviour and contribute to human-wildlife conflict. Predicting where social learning will occur and manipulating its use are, therefore, important in conservation, but doing so is not straightforward. Learning is an inherently biased process that has been shaped by natural selection to prioritize important information and facilitate its efficient uptake. In this regard, social learning is no different from other learning processes because it too is shaped by perceptual filters, attentional biases and learning constraints that can differ between habitats, species, individuals and contexts. The biases that constrain social learning are not understood well enough to accurately predict whether or not social learning will occur in many situations, which limits the effective use of social learning in conservation practice. Nevertheless, we argue that by tapping into the biases that guide the social transmission of information, the conservation applications of social learning could be improved. We explore the conservation areas where social learning is highly relevant and link them to biases in the cues and contexts that shape social information use. The resulting synthesis highlights many promising areas for collaboration between the fields and stresses the importance of systematic reviews of the evidence surrounding social learning practices.

AB  - | In recent years, the study of apartment buildings is important because of their growth in Iran. This issue has been neglected in contemporary architecture and landscape research. Previous studies show that one of the factors affecting the mood of apartment dwellers is aesthetic criteria. The purpose of this study is to redefine the aesthetic criteria in evaluating the residential facade of Tehran to improve the quality of experience of residents. To this end, in the first step, the aesthetics criteria of the facade were extracted from the literature on neuro-architectural research. In the second step, according to the mentioned criteria, the residents of the apartments were interviewed. This research is an applied study and its method is qualitative. Sixteen articles were content analyzed in a systematic review. Eleven physical criteria and 8 semantic criteria for the aesthetic of residential facades were extracted. Classification between criteria was done through open-ended interviews with 14 apartment residents in Tehran. Findings showed that among the physical and semantical criteria of the facade, "vegetation ", "color and materials ", and "surface of the openings " have a positive impact on the perception of the aesthetics of the facade. The results show that the residential facades of Tehran are at a low level in terms of semantic and symbolic aesthetic. At the same time, these facades are not acceptable in terms of emotional aesthetic and are only visually enhanced.

AB  - Cities all over the world are confronting intertwined environmental, social and economic problems and aim to become resilient to climate change and promote wellbeing for all their citizens. Nature-based solutions have been proposed as a promising policy approach to addressing urban problems for the potential they have to deliver multiple benefits and foster wellbeing for individuals and communities. However, the evidence for their multiple benefits is rather scarce and highly fragmented, and more robust frameworks for the monitoring and assessment of their impacts are needed to guide urban policy-making. This paper focuses on the current state of impact assessment of nature-based solutions in Europe and through a systematic review of the literature identifies four conceptual problems and three empirical gaps that impede the accumulation of solid evidence regarding of the impacts of different types of nature-based solutions for different social groups; as well as of the contextual conditions that contribute to their performance and delivery of multiple outcomes. Based on the identified mis-conceptualizations and gaps, we derive a series of principles that should guide the development of robust impact assessment frameworks for nature-based solutions. We discuss the policy implications of these gaps and principles. We conclude by making a series of recommendations that should inform the design of impact monitoring and evaluation frameworks in cities, in order to develop the comparative evidence base on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions. This, in turn, can inform urban decision-making on the appropriate design, implementation, and long-term regeneration of nature-based solutions, to ensure long-term delivery of important ecosystem services for different social groups.

AB  - The global agricultural paradigm is witnessing a transformative shift with the advent of precision agriculture. While large-scale agricultural enterprises have been swift in their embrace of this innovation, its uptake among small-scale farmers remains nuanced and complex. This study elucidates the multi-faceted determinants that influence the adoption of precision agriculture within the small-scale farming sector. The study adopts a systematic literature review approach, meticulously selecting and analysing 29 relevant papers. Drawing upon an exhaustive literature review and empirical analyses, the research presents a composite framework weaving economic, technological, social, and environmental factors. Among these, the social dynamics emerge as the most significant factor, shaped by awareness levels, knowledge dissemination pathways, and entrenched cultural norms. These social elements often intertwine with ingrained traditional practices and perceptions, forming the most intricate layer shaping adoption attitudes. Notably, although economic factors like substantial initial investments and the calculus of Return on Investment are present, they are overshadowed by social considerations. The technological landscape is characterised by the challenges of digital literacy, infrastructural readiness, and technological interoperability. Lastly, environmental imperatives, underscored by resource scarcity, climate change resilience, and ecosystem services, offer both challenges and motivations. Together, these factors delineate the intricate roadmap guiding small-scale farmers in their journey toward precision agriculture adoption. This comprehensive exploration provides stakeholders with actionable insights, fostering informed decision-making and strategic interventions to augment precision agriculture's integration within the small-scale farming tapestry.

AB  - The increase in the world population and resource scarcity has led to the introduction of environmental concepts such as sustainability and sustainable supply chain design (SSCD). However, there is a lack of consensus among researchers on how to measure sustainability in SSCD. Therefore, the authors propose a novel approach to measuring sustainability in the context of SSCD by developing an integrated, tractable, and representative metrics framework. The methodology corresponds to a quantitative approach involving bibliographic examination and statistical techniques. First, the authors conducted a systematic literature review by formulating research questions and a search protocol, searched for relevant articles, and conducted a quality assessment on full-text reviews to obtain metrics for measuring sustainability in SSCD from the literature. Then, they defined aggregation criteria representing their inclusion relationship by merging associated metrics. The authors then used Cluster Analysis (CA), a multivariate statistical technique, for grouping the metrics. Consequently, twelve clusters were distinguished from 541 research articles, grouping 51 metrics from different sustainability dimensions. It shows the strong connection among the sustainability dimensions, i.e., they must be assessed holistically. Then, we proposed reducing the 51 metrics to 5 to evaluate sustainability in the SSCD, allowing us to focus on a reduced number of indicators.

AB  - The Circular Economy (CE) is noted as an emerging framework to support sustainable production and consumption agendas. In addition, the CE aims to be a trigger for redefining economic growth pathways as sustainable, inclusive, and sensitive to ecological and environmental agendas, and to focus its operational standards on co-creating societal benefits. Concerning the guiding principles and the standards of practice applied to implement and scale circular economy, this study will provide an overview of water sector-specific circularity roadmaps and strategies in the Latin American Region (LAR). By using a semi-systematic review, document analysis, and qualitative assessment approach, we highlight framings and operational pathways, gaps, and needs within existing practices of circularity in the water sector. The results provide an overview of CE pathways at the national level of selected countries in the LAR, urging those nations to reflect various levels of advancement (low to high) with CE-focused innovations and policy support structures specific to the water and wastewater sectors. Towards the end, the study points to the 'call for action' to integrate outstanding advances and innovations in the circular economy within sectoral mandates for water and wastewater management, making an argument that circularity in the water sector could serve as an accelerator towards implementing the agenda outlined in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in particular for SDG 6 (water security for all).

AB  - The marginalization of mountain regions in Mediterranean Europe since the mid-20th Century has triggered important socioeconomic and environmental changes that are putting the survival of highly regulated and environmentally adapted landscapes in jeopardy. We still have only a limited understanding of the driving forces behind these dynamics of change and their final consequences for the structure and character of the landscape. In general, the transformation of the landscape and its causes have been studied at regional and local level and various syntheses have been made for Europe or the Mediterranean as a whole, focusing above all on changes in the use of farmland. The objective of this paper is to provide a holistic view of the changes that have taken place in the landscape in the Euro-Mediterranean region, focusing in particular on the mountains because of their role as heritage reserves and as sources of environmental services. This research involves a systematic review of the evidence about the dynamics of land use change, its underlying drivers and their effects on the landscape. We analyse 53 case studies from 6 countries situated on the northern shores of the Mediterranean. These studies covered a period of around 40 years and were each performed at a local scale. The results reveal that landscape change is caused above all by the abandonment of farmland and reforestation (in over 90% of cases), and by pressure from urban development in the case of coastal and peri-urban mountain ranges. In addition, the dominant dynamics in each case vary depending on the bioclimatic area in question, to the extent that bioclimate has been shown to be an important explanatory factor behind these dynamics. The underlying boosters of change normally act together and those most commonly cited are economic, demographic and geographic. As regards the impacts on the structure and character of the landscape, the dynamics analysed are manifested first and foremost in degradation processes, in an increase in homogenization, which affects above all the most humid bioclimates, and in the fragmentation of open spaces. This analysis provides a general overview of the causes and consequences of the changes in land use in the mountain regions of Mediterranean Europe and raises questions of interest for policy-making that affects the landscape.

AB  - Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is gaining importance in the current paediatric healthcare landscape. Improvement of paediatric health status is its major aim. However, for EBM to be successful, all stakeholders involved should understand what EBM really is, why and how EBM should or should not be practiced, and have the necessary skills to distinguish methodologically sound papers from biased opinion papers, and understand how and why guidelines are different from systematic reviews. Improving patient outcome requires attention to high-quality evidence and understanding of the processes of medical decision-making. Rigorous methodology is the cornerstone of guideline production, but in cases where quality evidence cannot be produced, as is often the case in paediatric nephrology because of low patient numbers, consensus-based guidance may be suitable to assist the practitioner at the bedside, as long as the underlying process is transparent. Most importantly, EBM should support patient involvement in a shared decision-making process. The more consistent and accurately predictable the effect of certain interventions is, clinically relevant to patients rather than affecting surrogate outcomes, and a priority for patients and other stakeholders, the more likely it is that adherence to the guidance provided will improve the outcome of patients.

AB  - Intelligence in Industry 4.0 has led to the development of smart buildings with various control systems for data collection, efficient optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). However, buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations. In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations, such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a promising area for further investigation.

AB  - Coffee is one of the most important globally traded commodities and substantially contributes to the livelihoods of millions of smallholders worldwide. As a climate-sensitive perennial crop, coffee is likely to be highly susceptible to changes in climate. Using a systematic approach, we explore evidence from the published academic literature of the influence of climate change and variability, specifically drought, on coffee production. A number of mostly negative impacts were reported in the current literature, including declines in coffee yield, loss of coffee-optimal areas with significant impacts on major global coffee-producing countries and growth in the distribution of pest and disease that indirectly influence coffee cultivation. Current research also identified positive effects of climate change such as increases in coffee-producing niche, particularly in areas at higher altitudes; however, whether these gains might offset losses from other production areas requires further investigation. Other advantages include increases in pollination services and the beneficial effects of elevated carbon concentration, leading to potential yield improvements. Future priorities should focus on major coffee-growing regions projected to be adversely affected by climate change, with specific attention given to potential adaptation strategies tailored to particular farming conditions such as relocation of coffee plantations to more climatically suitable areas, irrigation and agroforestry. The majority of studies were based in the Americas and concentrated on Arabica coffee. A broader spread of research is therefore required, especially for the large growing regions in Asia and for Robusta coffee, to support sustainable production of the global coffee industry.

AB  - Temporary wetlands are recognised biodiversity hotspots. Dormant egg banks, as part of their cryptic biodiversity, are responsible of wetlands resilience. Egg banks are also known to be sensitive indicators of anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to assess the current state of research of agrochemical impact on dormant egg banks in temporary wetlands. The systematic literature review carried out has shown the small number of studies on this topic. This study provides evidence of commonality concerning negative impact effect on the organisms, reducing hatching success, dormant eggs production and emergence, or species richness, among others, which might weaken ecosystem stabilization mechanisms by reducing biodiversity. Our review also revealed a glaring lack of in situ and long-term studies for understanding ecosystem consequences of toxicants on temporary wetlands. These gaps in knowledge hamper our ability to design and implement evidence-based conservation and management programs but opens opportunities for new research lines.

AB  - The use of knowledge management in the context of sustainability has been increasingly important over the years. Despite this importance, it is observed that this area is still little explored and there are many possibilities of academic research. Following a structured research protocol, the authors of this article performed a systematic review of the literature and identified plausible gaps to be explored in the development of future research. These gaps are presented in relation to the themes, strategies, objectives and research approach. From the point of view of the themes, there are opportunities related to the study of sustainability in small and medium enterprises, in relation to the potential of universities as engines for the generation of knowledge and in concerning the insertion of knowledge management to propose guidelines for obtaining productive systems. Regarding research strategies, the lack of studies that use action research as central focus stands out. Focusing on the objectives, there are many research approaches used with the goal of developing models and specific tools directed to the sharing of information. Finally, regarding the approach, there are few studies with a quantitative approach. We believe that the information presented here can contribute to the evolution of knowledge management focused on sustainability. No similar studies were found in the literature.

AB  - Ecological knowledge plays a significant role in ensuring efficient ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review to assess if sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused primarily on two vegetation types: cerrado sensu stricto (typical savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to advance Cerrado ecological restoration.

AB  - In order to face the severe climate conditions in semiarid regions, many managed aquifer recharge (MAR) and rainwater storage systems have been implemented by local communities. Governmental programs have helped to propagate the concept of MAR. Based on a systematic review, popular initiatives, current legislation, and research lines and programs were compiled and analyzed. Although the MAR global inventory points to the prevalence of in-channel modifications among ninety MAR sites, the Barraginhas Project alone has been responsible for the construction of more than 500,000 infiltration ponds up to 2013. In urban areas, aquifer recharge initiatives mostly aim to reduce runoff peak flows. In some cases these initiatives have been stimulated by urban drainage public policies. Compared to countries such as the USA and Australia, Brazil is still at an early stage in MAR initiatives and needs to overcome technical, legal, and socio-cultural challenges to adopt MAR approaches, in order to help in facing water security challenges in a future climate change scenario. This article aims to provide an overview of the state of the art concerning technological, scientific, and legal issues around MAR in Brazil and the respective challenges for the adoption of this approach at a national level.

AB  - In this paper, I conducted a systematic review of the economic development literature from 1959 to 2020 to reveal the ebbs and flows of major research topics, combining the text mining technique with the bibliographic analysis. Topics such as "regional development" and "sustainable development" have gained importance over the decades, while "development strategy" has lost its prominent status. New topics such as "climate change" and "developing countries" have emerged in recent years. An analysis of the citation network reveals three distinctive research trajectories: One engages with the concepts of the creative class, human capital, clusters, and art and culture. Another centers around the topic of "regional development", and a third, smaller group studies "new industrial district". This study helps researchers understand the evolution of the roadmap in the field of economic development, properly situate their own work in the literature, identify influential citations, and discover novel research topics in need of further exploration.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity, even at modest intensities, is associated with many health benefits. Most Americans, however, do not engage in the recommended levels. As practitioners seek ways to increase population rates of physical activity, interventions and advocacy efforts are being targeted to the community level. Yet, advocates, community leaders, and researchers lack the tools needed to assess local barriers to and opportunities for more active, healthy lifestyles. Investigators used a systematic review process to identify key indicators of activity-friendly communities that can assess and improve opportunities for regular physical activity.
   Methods: Investigators conducted a comprehensive literature review of both peer-reviewed literature and fugitive information (e.g., reports and websites) to generate an initial list of indicators for review (n=230). The review included a three-tiered, modified Delphi consensus-development process that incorporated input of international, national, state, and local researchers and practitioners from academic institutions, federal and state government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and funding agencies in public health, transportation, urban planning, parks and recreation, and public policy.
   Results: Ten promising indicators of activity-friendly communities were identified: land use environment, access to exercise facilities, transportation environment, aesthetics, travel patterns, social environment, land use economics, transportation economics, institutional and organizational policies, and promotion.
   Conclusions: Collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches are underway to test, refine, and expand this initial list of indicators and to develop measures that communities, community leaders, and policyrnakers can use to design more activity-friendly community environments.

AB  - We are in an increasingly disruptive context, in an Era in which the world presents challenging and growing levels of uncertainty, unpredictability, and complexity. As a result, society is facing, at all levels and in all areas, more and more global challenges, challenging its stability and prosperity, whether at a technological, economic, social, environmental, or educational level. The new Era, Era 5.0, which places the human being at the center of innovation and technological transformation, can and must make its contribution to improving the quality of life, solving social problems, and human well-being, with the support of technology. Thus, this work intends, based on a systematic review of the literature, to analyze the challenges of Era 5.0 and its impacts on industry, society, and education as engines and promoters of the path to sustainable development. The results of this work show that the challenges for industry and education on the road to a "new" society are immense, in order to achieve a more humanistic society, centered on human beings, quality of life, and sustainability. We believe in contributing to the state of the art in Era 5.0 and providing an analytical reflection in the field of education and industry, on the path towards a society that places the human being at the center of innovation and technological transformation.

AB  - Seagrasses provide crucial ecosystem services in the coastal environment, but are under increasing threat associated with anthropogenic activities. Seagrass meadows effectively trap suspended sediment, a key vector for trace metal transport, by altering local hydrodynamic conditions around their leaves and stems. As a result, seagrass meadows often have different geochemical sediment characteristics compared to adjacent bare sediments and may accumulate higher concentrations of trace metals. The aim of this systematic review was to identify research trends and knowledge gaps in the relationships between metals and seagrasses. The systematic search of the literature identified a total of 191 relevant articles. Although seagrasses have a broad geographic distribution, the highest diversity and endemism exists in the Indo-Pacific region, yet most studies (40%) were conducted in the Mediterranean Sea. There were also taxonomic gaps with some common species groups, including Amphibolis and Thalassodendron spp., being poorly studied. The reviewed studies examined the relationship between seagrass and 39 metal elements. There were no studies examining rare-earth elements (REEs) or platinum-group elements (PGEs), both of which are critical classes of metals in emerging technologies. Furthermore, the review determined that all 191 studies focused on the impact of metals on seagrasses, while only six also considered the effect of seagrasses on metal geochemistry in sediments. We conclude that further research is necessary to address these key gaps in knowledge to better understand the role(s) of seagrasses in the distribution, immobilization, and release of trace metals in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a fundamental role in the global economy. However, SMEs usually have different characteristics from larger enterprises, e.g., essential resource restrictions, lower performance, and higher environmental impacts. This requires them to search for strategies to be more competitive and sustainable. A possible solution relies on introducing Lean-Green practices. Previous research indicated that digitalization could be an enabler of Lean. Lean can also help to achieve increased environmental performance using the Lean-Green approach. In this study, this important yet under-studied area is investigated as we consider digitalization as an enabler for implementing lean in SMEs, with a focus on Lean-Green practices. A systematic literature review is executed, following a new framework based on topic modelling for extracting the papers. The topic modelling is executed through latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) which is a machine learning technique. In methodological means, this paper represents an example of the frontier of digitalization for research activities. Regarding the investigated focus, the main findings revealed that digitalization is an enabler to Lean and to Lean-Green. As digitalization supports information sharing, it consequently fosters performance measurement systems, improvements, and value chain integration.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, understanding its impacts on cities has received much attention in science and policy circles. This paper systematically reviews the literature on the interface of the pandemic and urban sustainability. The objective is to portray the impacts brought by the COVID-19 outbreak in urban environments within the sustainability framework and to detect trends and challenges for future research. The paper follows a methodology that integrates both bibliometric and systematic review approaches. The first approach relies on bibliometric analysis to provide an overview of the landscape of main trends on this nexus. The second approach presents a content analysis that deepens the work by outlining the impacts of the pandemic and the challenges that emerged on five different key topics for urban sustainability. The role of resilient urban planning is discussed as an integrative concept to face diverse challenges in the construction of sustainable cities in a post-pandemic scenario. Likewise, the study deliberates on future research topics related to resilient urban planning, social equity, healthy urban environments, sustainable mobility, and circular economy. This review serves as a guide for researchers and urban planners to understand emerging challenges and future research trends in urban sustainability.

AB  - Background Antibiotic resistance is a major concern for public and environmental health. The role played by the environment in disseminating resistance is increasingly considered, as well as its capacity for mitigation. We reviewed the literature on strategies to control dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the environment. Methods This systematic review focused on three main strategies: (i) restriction of antibiotic use (S1), (ii) treatments of liquid/solid matrices (S2) and (iii) management of natural environment (S3). Articles were collected from seven scientific databases until July 2017 and from Web of Science until June 2018. Only studies reporting measurements of ARB, ARG or MGE in environmental samples were included. An evidence map was drawn from metadata extracted from all studies eligible for S1, S2 and S3. Subsets of studies were assessed for internal and external validity to perform narrative and quantitative syntheses. A meta-analysis was carried out to assess the effects of organic waste treatments (random-effect models). Review findings Nine hundred and thirty-one articles representing 1316 individual studies (n) were eligible for S1 (n = 59), S2 (n = 781) and S3 (n = 476) strategies, respectively. Effects of interventions to control the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment were primarily studied in strategy S2. A partial efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to reduce antibiotic resistance in treated effluent was reported in 118 high validity studies. In spite of the heterogeneity in published results, the meta-analysis showed that composting and drying were efficient treatments to reduce the relative abundance of ARG and MGE in organic waste, by 84% [65%; 93%] and 98% [80%; 100%], respectively. The effect of anaerobic digestion was not statistically significant (51% reduction [- 2%; 77%]) when organic waste treatments were compared together in the same model. Studies in strategies S1 and S3 mainly assessed the effects of exposure to sources of contamination. For instance, 28 medium/high validity studies showed an increase of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments at the WWTP discharge point. Some of these studies also showed a decrease of resistance as the distance from the WWTP increases, related to a natural resilience capacity of aquatic environments. Concerning wildlife, nine medium/high validity studies showed that animals exposed to anthropogenic activities carried more ARB.

AB  - Urban and Regional Integrated Energy Planning is crucial to define transition strategies toward sustainable development and post-carbon cities; particularly, in the built environment sector which is one of the main responsible for energy consumption and carbon emissions.
   The paper aims at offering a systematic review of existing urban and regional energy planning approaches. This analysis is based on literature review. The reviewed papers are critically analyzed and discussed through a Meta-analysis and a SWOT analysis. The papers are classified in order to highlight the main research trends and to illustrate the most relevant characteristics of the principal approaches. This critical analysis of the papers highlights the lack of an holistic and integrated framework which is able to take into account the large variety of dimensions related to sustainable planning. A major achievement of this study is to provide information on how the various existing approaches can be integrated to handle the entire planning procedure adequately.
   The result provides a preliminary theoretical framework to integrate different approaches, identify the main barriers and future challenges in the field of research. This framework will help urban actors to develop energy planning projects, guiding them in the choice among a significant number of existing planning approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Historical cartography constitutes one of the primary sources that allows us to substantiate the protection, management and planning actions with regards to the landscape. Reviewing it facilitates, for example, the uncovering and verification of the ancient patterns of settlements and land connections. This article explores the way in which the systematic review of the historical maps supports the analysis of the territorialisation processes. This analysis allows us to detect and identify those territorial assets with heritage values that have characterised the cultural landscape at different times. A graphic device is proposed to facilitate the synthesis and subsequent interpretation of the rules for transforming the territorial heritage that have influenced the evolution of the cultural landscape. This interpretation is essential to guarantee the effectiveness of certain design strategies that operate in terms of the landscape, such as cultural itineraries. This process of analysis and synthesis is exemplified through the case study of Italica's buffer zone, in the area of the lower Guadalquivir.

AB  - Scientific development is an invaluable asset to a country. Policies and development modes should be carried out based on scientific findings not only in industry, but also in transportation infrastructure construction. Building an integrated transportation system, which is in line with the national requirements of China and supports sustainable socio-economic development, is a key strategic issue related to building a moderately prosperous society and achieving realistic goals of a medium-level developed country. Based on a systematic review of the advances in China's transportation infrastructure over the last 60 years, this paper explores the main drivers of transportation development, including national policy, transportation structure, investment efficiency, and technological innovation. Analysis shows that China's comprehensive transportation infrastructure construction since 1949 can be divided into five stages initiated by these drivers, which correspond to four transition modes: policy transition, structural transition, efficiency transition, and technology transition. The transition path of China's transportation development shows that the dominant factors have changed, and the interval for each transition has shortened. With the implementation of the '12th Five-Year Plan', China's transportation infrastructure construction is showing some new characteristics and facing a new development transition. Finally, this paper analyzes the trends in transportation development in China and concludes that technological innovation will be the main driving force to increase the transportation supply and service area in the future.

AB  - Fire can promote biodiversity, but changing patterns of fire threaten species worldwide. While scientific literature often describes ''inappropriate fire regimes'' as a significant threat to biodiversity, less attention has been paid to the characteristics that make a fire regime inappropriate. We go beyond this generic description and synthesize how inappropriate fire regimes contribute to declines of animal populations using threatened mammals as a case study. We developed a demographic framework for classifying mechanisms by which fire regimes cause population decline and applied the framework in a systematic review to identify fire characteristics and interacting threats associated with population declines in Australian threatened land mammals (n = 99). Inappropriate fire regimes threaten 88% of Australian threatened land mammals. Our review indicates that intense, large, and frequent fires are the primary cause of fire-related population declines, particularly through their influence on survival rates. However, several species are threatened by a lack of fire, and there is considerable uncertainty in the evidence base for fire-related declines. Climate change and predation are documented or predicted to interact with fire to exacerbate mammalian declines. This demographic framework will help target conservation actions globally and will be enhanced by empirical studies of animal survival, movement, and reproduction.

AB  - Historical trends about marine ship-source oil spill incidents from 1990 to 2010 in China were analyzed, and it provided an overview of the status quo of China's management in response to marine oil spill from ships. The Chinese government has issued a series of laws on marine environmental protection since 1982, and promulgated many regulations to prevent and tackle ship-source oil spill. At present, the oil spill emergency response system established in China has five levels: the national level, sea level, provincial level, port level, and ship level. China has demonstrated its ability to control and remove small-scale oil spill from ships in port area and near-shore coastal waters, and also paid attention to related research and development projects.

AB  - Crop-pollinator interactions are essential for world food security. Studying crop pollination from a network approach allows identification of target pollinators for conservation and management, and gaps in our knowledge. Solanaceae represents the third highest ranked family based on economic value, and its production is highly improved by animal pollination. This study aimed to integrate global data on solanaceous crop pollination and analyse the interaction patterns using a meta-network approach. Our questions were: (i) how are interactions structured and what are the structuring roles of species; and (ii) what are the main gaps in our knowledge?Data were obtained through a systematic review of the main scientific databases. The network structure was described using connectivity and modularity calculations, and the role of species using centrality metrics.The 251 pollinator species reported were in seven orders, mainly Hymenoptera (84.9%). The generalists Bombus and Apis species were the most common pollinators. The meta-network was modular, and all modules mostly included bees. Most species were peripherals, around 12% were connectors, and there were no module hubs. Apis mellifera was the only network hub (supergeneralist).The most important pollinators are the most managed pollinators worldwide; however, many native species play a role in structuring the meta-network. Main gaps include species of importance to pepper pollination, lack of species-specific identification, and the need for more robust experimental studies evaluating the pollination efficiency of native, manageable bees.
   The pollination meta-network of Solanaceae crops is modular, has a high diversity of pollinators, with Apis mellifera as the unique network hub, and native bees playing an important role for network structure.image

AB  - This paper reports a Scopus-based systematic literature review of a wide variety of transportation policies and mitigation strategies that have been conducted around the world to minimize COVID-19 contagion risk in transportation systems. The review offers a representative coverage of countries across all continents of the planet, as well as among representative climate regions - as weather is an important factor to consider. The readership interested in policies and mitigation strategies is expected to involve a wide range of actors, each involving a particular application context; hence, the literature is also characterized by key attributes such as: transportation mode; actor (users, operators, government, industry); jurisdiction (national, provincial, city, neighborhood); and area of application (planning, regulation, operations, research, incentives). An in-depth analysis of the surveyed literature is then reported, focusing first on condensing the literature into 151 distinct policies and strategies, which are subsequently categorized into 25 broad categories that are discussed at length. The compendium and discussion of strategies and policies reported not only provide comprehensive guidelines to inform various courses of action for decision-makers, planners, and social communicators, but also emphasize on future work and the potential of some of these strategies to be the precursors of meaningful, more sustainable behavioral changes in future mobility patterns.

AB  - Purpose of Review We reviewed the exposure assessments of ambient air pollution used in studies of fertility, fecundability, and pregnancy loss.
   Recent Findings Comprehensive literature searches were performed in the PUBMED, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Of 168 total studies, 45 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. We find that 69% of fertility and pregnancy loss studies have used one-dimensional proximity models or surface monitor data, while only 35% have used the improved models, such as land-use regression models (4%), dispersion/chemical transport models (11%), or fusion models (20%). No published studies have used personal air monitors.
   Summary While air pollution exposure models have vastly improved over the past decade from a simple, one-dimensional distance or air monitor data to models that incorporate physiochemical properties leading to better predictive accuracy, precision, and increased spatiotemporal variability and resolution, the fertility literature has yet to fully incorporate these new methods. We provide descriptions of each of these air pollution exposure models and assess the strengths and limitations of each model, while summarizing the findings of the literature on ambient air pollution and fertility that apply each method.

AB  - Environmental contingent valuation (CV) studies in a context of developing countries have been progressing in the past two decades. However, these studies are prone to biases due to their hypothetical nature and most of these studies lack appropriately designed and implemented CV survey. This paper carried out a systematic review of previous 36 forest CV studies conducted in the context of developing countries, focusing on two main ob-jectives: (i) examine communities' preference and willing to pay (WTP) for forest conservation in developing countries, and (ii) assess content and construct validity of the included studies, using the selected indicators from best practice guidelines recommended in literature. The overall annual mean WTP ranges from $0.01-75.36 and 7.17-94.34 man-days per household for monetary and labor time payment modes, respectively. The results reveal that WTP estimates slightly vary among individual studies within the same country, whereas, the esti-mates widely vary between countries. These imply that policy designs for forest conservation programs need to give emphasis to the local contexts and other relevant parameters. Moreover, the finding indicates that most of the CV studies included in this review are failed to document and report validity test fully and explicitly as per recommended in literature, despite the existing of some efforts to improve a quality of the studies. Thus, it is strongly suggested that future studies on the theme have to conduct, document and fully report validity test. The finding provides available evidences on accuracy of the prior CV forest studies that could inform policy/users in using the results for decision making.

AB  - Food systems primary goal should be to nourish human beings. And yet, the current industrial food system, with its profit-maximising ethos, is not achieving that goal despite producing food in excess. On the contrary, this system is the main driver of malnutrition on the planet, as well as environmental degradation. Nonetheless, food systems also play a double role as Nature's steward. Deciding which role we want food systems to play will very much depend on the idea we have about food. What is food for humans? The dominant narrative of the industrial food system undeniably considers food as a tradeable commodity whose value is mostly determined by its price. This narrative was crafted and disseminated initially by academics, who largely favoured one option (commodification of food) over the others (food as commons or public good). In this research, the author aims to understand how academia has explored the value-based considerations of food as commodity and private good (hegemonic narratives) compared to considerations of food as commons and public good (alternative narratives). A systematic literature review of academic papers since 1900 has been carried out with Google Scholar (TM), using different searching terms related to "food + commons", "food + commodity", "food + public good" and "food + private good". Following the PRISMA methodology to clean the sample, a content analysis has been carried out with the 70 references including "food + commons" and "food + public good". Results clearly show that both topics are very marginal subjects in the academic milieu (only 179 results before cleaning) but with a sharp increase in the eight years that followed the 2008 food crisis. On the contrary, "food + commodity" presents almost 50,000 references since 1900 (before cleaning), with a remarkable increase since the 1980s, coincidental with the dominance of neoliberal doctrines. The phenomenological approach to food (epitomised in the "food as" searching term) largely prevails over the ontological approach to food ("food is") except when food is identified as a "private good". This result points to the ontological absolute "food is a private good" developed by the economic scholars as a dominant narrative that locked other valuations of food by legal, political or historical scholars or non-scientific epistemologies. In a world where the industrial food system has clearly proven its unfitness to feed us adequately in a sustainable way, the need for academia to explore other food valuations seems more urgent than ever. Scholars need to approach other narratives of food (as commons or public good) that go beyond the hegemonic and permitted ideas, unlocking unexplored food policy options to guarantee universal access to food for all humans, regardless their purchasing power, without mortgaging the viability of our planet.

AB  - This systematic review critically analyzes the literature on the study of energy-use patterns in agricultural crop systems in Iran. We examine the relevant methodologies and research trends from 2008 to 2019, a particularly active and productive period. Initially, we find researchers using energy audits and regression modeling to estimate energy-use patterns. Then economic and environmental-emissions audits are more commonly incorporated into analyses. Finally, the application of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are observed in papers. The main focus of this study is on energy-use patterns, economic modelling, and environmental emissions. We then address critical issues, including sample size, energy equivalents, and additional practical energy-saving recommendations which can be considered by researchers in future analyses. The application of AI in the analysis of agricultural systems, and how it can be used to achieve sustainable agriculture, is discussed with the aim of providing guidelines for researchers interested in energy flow in agricultural systems, especially in Iran. To achieve sustainable agriculture systems, we recommend more attention be given toward considering the impact of social factors in addition to energy, environmental and economic factors. Finally, this review should guide other researchers in choosing appropriate crop types and regions in need study to avoid repetitive studies.

AB  - In recent decades, marine protected areas ( MPAs) have become the management measure of choice for cetacean conservation. They are a conspicuous conservation approach, the principle of which is readily understood by the public. Despite the drive to further develop the network of protected areas, the efficacy for cetacean conservation has rarely been considered. Policymakers need to make informed decisions on the best approaches for conservation of these highly charismatic species in circumstances where there are increasing pressures for the development of maritime industries combined with declining resources for conservation. As such, there is now a vital need for a synthesis of the available evidence for the value of MPAs for cetacean conservation. The results of the systematic review undertaken here indicate that in over 80 years of use and over 1000 designations, there is a distinct lack of rigorous published evidence for direct conservation benefits of MPAs for cetaceans. Two studies demonstrated improved survival as a result of MPA designation, although this was insufficient to reverse population declines. One study noted the continued use of an MPA because of management intervention, and another recorded a stable population within an MPA but did not demonstrate that this was attributable to the MPA. In contrast, there were considerably more examples of the failure of protected areas to attain their conservation goals for cetaceans. These were the result of changes in the spatial distribution of the populations for which the protected area had been designated, the lack of enforcement of measures within the site, or the need for additional measures beyond MPA boundaries. This review has highlighted that, for cetaceans at least, the main role of MPAs is in awareness raising and education rather than for direct ecological and/or population conservation purposes. Given the mobility of cetaceans and the widespread nature of many of the anthropogenic pressures to which they are exposed, pragmatic and effective solutions for conservation are required. An adaptive and dynamic approach to the management of human activities presents one possible solution.

AB  - Exotic species are one of the main threats to biodiversity, leading to alterations in the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems. However, they can sometimes also provide ecological services, such as seed dispersal. Therefore, we assessed the ecological impacts of exotic species on native dispersal systems and the mechanisms underlying the disruption of mutualistic plant-disperser interactions. Exotic species negatively affect dispersal mutualisms by (i) altering dispersal behavior and visitation rates of native dispersers, (ii) predating native dispersers, (iii) transmitting forest pathogens, and (iv) predating seeds. Conversely, positive impacts include the dispersal of native plants, forest regeneration, and native habitat restoration via (i) increasing the visitation rates of frugivorous birds, (ii) facilitating the colonization and establishment of native forest trees, (iii) enhancing forest species seedling survival, and (iv) facilitating seed rain and seedling recruitment of early and late successional native plants. The reviewed studies provide similar results in some cases and opposite results in others, even within the same taxa. In almost all cases, exotic species cause negative impacts, although sometimes they are necessary to ensure native species' persistence. Therefore, exotic species management requires a comprehensive understanding of their ecological roles, since the resulting effects rely on the complexity of native-exotic species interactions.

AB  - Agriculture provides the largest share of food supplies and ensures a critical number of ecosystem services (e.g., food provisioning). Therefore, agriculture is vital for food security and supports the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) 2 (SDG 2 -zero hunger) as others SDG's. Several studies have been published in different world areas with different research directions focused on increasing food and nutritional security from an agricultural land system perspective. The heterogeneity of the agricultural research studies calls for an interdisciplinary and comprehensive systematization of the different research directions and the plethora of approaches, scales of analysis, and reference data used. Thus, this work aims to systematically review the contributions of the different agricultural research studies by systematizing the main research fields and present a synthesis of the diversity and scope of research and knowledge. From an initial search of 1151 articles, 260 meet the criteria to be used in the review. Our analysis revealed that most articles were published between 2015 and 2019 (59%), and most of the case studies were carried out in Asia (36%) and Africa (20%). The number of studies carried out in the other continents was lower. In the last 30 years, most of the research was centred in six main research fields: land-use changes (28%), agricultural efficiency (27%), climate change (16%), farmer's motivation (12%), urban and peri-urban agriculture (11%), and land suitability (7%). Overall, the research fields identified are directly or indirectly linked to 11 of the 17 SDGs. There are essential differences in the number of articles among research fields, and future efforts are needed in the ones that are less represented to support food security and the SDGs.

AB  - The organization of a territory relies on a group of transformations produced by economic, environmental, and social emergencies, generating disruptions along with history. Furthermore, every new scenario generates a considerable impact, which makes it more difficult to recover from increasing urban ecological footprints. COVID-19-emergence-aware cities face new challenges that will test their resilience. This new outline constitutes a study regarding urban planning from an environmental and resilience perspective within this new pandemic state of emergency. It contains four main topics: emergent cities, natural resources, sustainability, and resilience. The document shows a case study carried out in a Colombian town named Cajica, where a bibliometric inquiry conducted with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) adjustments was managed, tested on forty-one scientific papers; all the above were verified by VOSviewer software tools. The study reveals the creation and visualization of several keyword networks and relations retrieved from all the selected articles, along with the use of eight additional documents for all relation analyses. Sustainability and resilience are the main findings, supported as a process of functionality within urban planning. Sustainability findings' results are prioritized, along with resilience analysis processes, which are both frameworks used during the COVID-19 pandemic; they constitute the main argument within this set of changes, building on alterations of lifestyle and behavioral situations within the main cities.

AB  - Road transport infrastructures are highly valuable assets designed for long period of use and play a major socioeconomic role. Conformity of road infrastructure development to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability requirements of social, economic and environmental has gained immense debate in the construction industry in recent years. The rapid population increase worldwide coupled with demand for services and widespread use of planet's finite resources has resulted to the generation of wastes associated with the construction, utilization, rehabilitation and reconstruction of pavement infrastructure raising great concern to stakeholders in the road transportation sub-sector because of the environmental impacts of the associated activities. However, attempts have been made to address sustainability concerns in the road infrastructure programs to meet both internal and external (environmental) sustainability, but most of this have been in Europe and America, leaving developing economies in Africa and Asia struggling with meeting the sustainability challenges. Tools and methodologies have been developed to evaluate sustainability of road infrastructures from the quantitative (life cycle assessments), qualitative (sustainability rating systems) and climate change perspective. Through a descriptive and exploratory approach, this paper delves into the documentary advancement in achieving sustainable development of road transport infrastructure.

AB  - Despite the growing problem of anxiety and depression amongst young people aged 14-24 years living in urban settings, reviews about the role of exposure to green and blue spaces or nature in preventing anxiety and depression tend to focus on children, adults or sometimes adolescents. This review aims to explore whether exposure to green and blue spaces reduces the risk of anxiety and depression among young people aged 14-24 years living in urban settings and provide a conceptual framework. The academic databases CINAHL plus, Global Health, MEDLINE, ProQuest: Dissertations and Theses, PsycINFO, Scopus and OpenGrey were searched for research published in English between January 2000 and June 2020. All study designs were eligible. All included studies were assessed for quality. Searches identified 9208 sources with 48 meeting the inclusion criteria for the review. Experimental studies provided evidence that walking or being in a green space improves mood and state anxiety immediately following the intervention. Non-randomised evaluations and observational studies suggest that social interaction, physical activity, and mindfulness mediate the relationship between exposure to green space and mental health. We propose that the absence of noise and restorative qualities of green spaces promotes mindfulness and interrupt rumination, which in turn reduce the risk of anxiety disorders and depression. This review and the resulting conceptual framework provide evidence to healthcare professionals about the value of contact with nature and green social prescribing. For policymakers, it provides evidence about the value of bringing the benefits of forests, vegetation and nature into cities, and ensuring that these spaces are accessible and safe for young people to use.

AB  - Transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) are regarded as crucial instruments for biodiversity conservation as they connect landscapes across country borders. The TFCA framework is built on multi-actor, multi-sector and multi-level negotiations, a concept that incorporates principles of landscape governance (LG). This article is driven by our interest in the governance of transfrontier landscapes such as the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. The study aims to explore the narratives of two academic discourses of TFCA and LG. The study uses a bibliometric analysis and systematic review based on PRISMA to determine (i) to which degree the two discourses share commonalities in their narratives and take each other into account (ii) how the discourses have developed between 1998 and 2022 (iii) the geographical distribution of publications on the two discourses. Our results identified six clusters which include: African Wildlife Conservation, Governance for Biodiversity Conservation, TFCA Wildlife Connectivity, Policies and Strategies, Political Ecology, and Management of Protected Areas. The discourses depict commonalities attributed to conservation, power and actor roles. However, LG is more governance-oriented while TFCA is more skewed towards wildlife management. The TFCA discourse is a more Southern African-centred debate whilst the LG debate is more rooted in the global North resulting from unique challenges, priorities, and approaches to landscape management. Moreover, a shift from a conservation-centred approach to a more holistic social-ecological system approach is evident. By leveraging on LG and TFCA strengths, cross-fertilization can foster meaningful cross-collaborations in managing different landscapes through dialogue, knowledge sharing, and identifying common goals, challenges and opportunities.

AB  - Global food systems need an urgent transformation to be compatible with sustainable development. While much of the recent academic discussion has focused on food production and consumption, food supply chains have received considerably less attention. Here, we conduct a large-scale, systematic literature review of 48,014 academic articles to assess the links between the food cold chain literature and sustainable development. We find a multitude of deep links between food cooling and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but also identify underexplored areas of sustainable food cooling research regarding its (1) goals, (2) analytical depth, and (3) context specificity: There is a limited understanding how several relevant synergies between SDGs can be captured, how to best design sustainable food cold chains across multiple value chain stages, and how to scale sustainable cold chains in low-income and lower-middle-income country contexts. We recommend to explicitly consider the salient interconnections between SDGs, increase the analytical depth by deploying more system-level approaches across entire value chains, and focus on localized solutions in contexts where food supply chains are most underdeveloped.

AB  - In this study, our aim is to present a comprehensive systematic review on digitalization (DT) in facility management (FM) and FM performance management (PM). Past research on these themes indicated that either research articles on DT in FM or research studies on FM PM are separately dealt with. However, in contrast, in our literature review, we try to present a holistic literature review by integrating both research streams on DT applications for FM and FM PM. A total 130 academic journal articles published on these subjects, between 1990 and 2021, from Web of Science and Google Scholars, were reviewed in this article. Moreover, this article identified a number of possibilities for future research on DT and FM PM, including the interoperability enhancement of building information modeling (BIM) methodology, the test and implementation of BIM concept for smart transportation infrastructure, usage of the integration of 3D analysis algorithms, the perfect cross integration of BIM and geographic information system (GIS) and systematic research efforts with new methodologies and theoretical constructs. We hope that this article will help researchers determine the areas where further research must be conducted and what kind of future directions would be valuable for DT and PM in FM.

AB  - With a global market of 30 billion USD, agricultural insurance plays a key role in risk finance and contributes to climate change adaptation by achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including no poverty, zero hunger, and climate action. The existing evidence in agricultural insurance is scattered across regions, topics and risks, and a structured synthesis is unavailable. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 796 peer-reviewed papers on agricultural insurance published between 2000 and 2019. The goal of this review was twofold: (a) categorizing agricultural insurance literature by agricultural product insured, research theme, geographical study area, insurance type and hazards covered, and (b) mapping country-wise research intensity of these indicators vis-a-vis historical and projected risk and crisis events-extreme weather disasters, projected temperature increase under SSP5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenario and livestock epidemics. We find that insurance research is focused on high-income countries while crops are the dominating agricultural product insured (33% of the papers). Large producers in production systems like fruits and vegetables (South America), millets (Africa) and fisheries and aquaculture (South-east Asia) are not focused upon in the literature. Research on crop insurance is taking place where historical extreme weather disasters are frequent (correlation coefficient of 0.75), while we find a surprisingly low correlation between climate change induced temperature increases in the future and current research on crop insurance, even when sub-setting for papers on the research theme of climate change and insurance (-.04). There is also limited evidence on the role of insurance to scale adaptation and mitigation measures to de-risk farming. Further, we find that the study area of livestock insurance papers is weakly correlated to the occurrence of livestock epidemics in the past (-.06) and highly correlated to the historical drought frequency (.51). For insurance to play its relevant role in climate change adaptation as described in the SDGs, we recommend governments, insurance companies and researchers to better tune their interest to risk-prone areas and include novel developments in agriculture which will require major investments, and, hence, insurability, in the coming years.

AB  - Drought is one natural disaster with the greatest impact worldwide. Southern Africa (SA) is susceptible and vulnerable to drought due to its type of climate. In the last four decades, droughts have occurred more frequently, with increasing intensity and impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and health. The work consists of a systematic literature review on the drought regime's characteristics in the SA under current and future climatic conditions, conducted on the Web of Science and Scopus platforms, using the PRISMA2020 methodology, with usual and appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria to minimize/eliminate the risk of bias, which lead to 53 documents published after the year 1987. The number of publications on the drought regime in SA is still very small. The country with the most drought situations studied is South Africa, and the countries with fewer studies are Angola and Namibia. The analysis revealed that the main driver of drought in SA is the ocean-atmosphere interactions, including the El Nino Southern Oscillation. The documents used drought indices, evaluating drought descriptors for some regions, but it was not possible to identify one publication that reports the complete study of the drought regime, including the spatial and temporal distribution of all drought descriptors in SA.

AB  - Interest in the global unaffordable housing crisis is evident in its burgeoning publications. However, systematic review of the literature is limited concerning data visualization and mapping of the knowledge structure and worldwide trend of publications on housing. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap through a quantitative method-scientometric analysis. To this end, three networking tools-CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Gephi-were employed in analysing 11,981 bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus for two decades (1998-2017). The research findings are informative in identifying trends, linkages and gaps in the literature. Besides, they reveal collaboration pattern among countries, academic institutions and publication outlets of housing studies. These have practical implications for policymakers. The findings are indicative of pivotal areas of relatively low research outputs that can be the focus for further research. They are also important for efficient research and development policies for attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in housing.

AB  - Between 1967 and 1971, the Chilean government nationalized its large-scale copper mining industry. While this process is widely considered successful given the demonstrated long-term state capacity to profitably operate the assets, the discussion on its net financial convenience has usually been disregarded. Aiming to improve the understanding of this case of resource nationalism, this paper follows two complementary approaches. First, we provide a systematic review of the historical background, development, and short-term impact of the Chilean nationalization, consolidating at the same time the available financial data on fiscal inflows and outflows as part of this process. Secondly, we perform an ex-post NPV assessment using a 10% discount rate over the annual cash flows that the government has perceived from the nationalized mining operations from 1967 to 2022 and compare it with a hypothetical counterfactual scenario in which these mines would have remained privately owned. This yields a higher NPV of the Nationalization compared to the counterfactual. Considering that discount rates above 11.1% or operational cost reductions by 4.5% indicate a net financial loss, the results suggest that, purely from a financial perspective, the nationalization process was marginally positive for the government. We expect that this analysis provides support for a thoughtful mineral policy that contributes to sustainable human and economic development in resource-rich countries.

AB  - Reducing car dependency requires orchestrated multi-sectoral, multi-policy action in a complex landscape. Thus, development of proposed interventions to reduce car dependency should be informed by systems thinking, complexity science, and socio-technical transition theory. We aim to co-design sustainable systems-oriented intervention approaches to reduce car dependency in Belfast. The study includes seven integrated tasks-1: Map stakeholders and partnerships influencing car dependency using stakeholder network analysis; 2: A review of systematic reviews regarding interventions to reduce car dependency; 3: Map-related policies via analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews; 4: A participatory group model building workshop to co-produce a shared understanding of the complex system perpetuating car dependency and a transition vision; 5: Using Discrete Choice Experiments, survey road users to evaluate the importance of transport infrastructure attributes on car dependency and on alternative modes of travel; 6: Citizen juries will 'sense-check' possible actions; and, 7: Stakeholders will interpret the findings, plan orchestrated multi-sectoral action, and agree on ways to sustain collaborations towards the common vision of reducing car dependency. We expect to attain a systemic view of the car dependency issue, potential intervention approaches to reduce it, and a framework for their integration through the co-ordination of stakeholder actions.

AB  - This literature review provides a systematic review of smart city research between 2000 and 2019. The aim of the review is to provide a comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art of research in smart cities by addressing major issues and identifying gaps and areas for future research. The analysis of 191 publications drawn from high-quality journals and the most influential or highly cited smart city literature highlights four major challenges for small city research: (a) smart city research is often fragmented and technology-driven; (b) many studies are on the perceived benefits of smart cities and fewer on the downsides of technologies and failed projects; (c) there is a need to build new theories for smart city research; and (d) there is a lack of empirical testing of the conceptual frameworks developed in smart city research. The research insights of this literature review may encourage practitioners, including city councillors, urban planners, and business managers, to consider smart city strategies in a holistic way when building vibrant, sustainable, and resilient cities of the future.

AB  - Background: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has become a major public health challenge in India. Factors relevant to the development and implementation of diabetes prevention programmes in resource-constrained countries, such as India, have been under-studied. The purpose of this study is to describe the findings from research aimed at informing the development and evaluation of a Diabetes Prevention Programme in Kerala, India (K-DPP).
   Methods: Data were collected from three main sources: (1) a systematic review of key research literature; (2) a review of relevant policy documents; and (3) focus groups conducted among individuals with a high risk of progressing to diabetes. The key findings were then triangulated and synthesised.
   Results: Prevalence of risk factors for diabetes is very high and increasing in Kerala. This situation is largely attributable to rapid changes in the lifestyle of people living in this state of India. The findings from the systematic review and focus groups identified many environmental and personal determinants of these unhealthy lifestyle changes, including: less than ideal accessibility to and availability of health services; cultural values and norms; optimistic bias and other misconceptions related to risk; and low expectations regarding one's ability to make lifestyle changes in order to influence health and disease outcomes. On the other hand, there are existing intervention trials conducted in India which suggests that risk reduction is possible. These programmes utilize multi-level strategies including mass media, as well as strategies to enhance community and individual empowerment. India's national programme for the prevention and control of major non-communicable diseases (NCD) also provide a supportive environment for further community-based efforts to prevent diabetes.
   Conclusion: These findings provide strong support for undertaking more research into the conduct of community-based diabetes prevention in the rural areas of Kerala. We aim to develop, implement and evaluate a group-based peer support programme that will address cultural and family determinants of lifestyle risks, including family decision-making regarding adoption of healthy dietary and physical activity patterns. Furthermore, we believe that this approach will be feasible, acceptable and effective in these communities; with the potential for scale-up in other parts of India.

AB  - Several factors have led to an increase in the focus on sustainable development. In this context, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) has gained tremendous momentum in research and implementation. Fitted into CE's concept, the Life Extension Strategies (LES) have been popular among industrial practitioners, regulators, policymakers, and academics from different industries due to the several benefits of these strategies. The general scope of this study is to approach LES within the industrial environment. The main goal is to understand how Remanufacturing and Refurbishment (R/R) strategies have been applied in different industry types. To achieve this goal, we carried out a systematic literature review whereby we captured some examples of R/R applications that demonstrate the potential of application to various industries (e.g., aerospace/aeronautics, energy power, and automotive industries) and equipment types (e.g., nuclear reactor, hydropower plant, and turbine blades). We also described some strategies to implement LES (e.g., economic analysis and life cycle assessment) and the different impacts achieved or expected (life extension, cost-saving, and efficiency enhancement). Moreover, we discussed three specific points concerning R/R application, the LES categorization, and the inexistence of a multi-dimensional framework to LES. Finally, we provided a set of systematized information about R/R.

AB  - This paper identifies the literature that deals with adaptation to climate change in the transport sector. It presents a systematic review of the adaptations suggested in the literature. Although it is frequently claimed that this socially and economically important sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, there is comparatively little research into its adaptation. The 63 sources we found are analysed following an action framework of adaptation. This distinguishes different adaptational functions and means of adaptation. By an open coding procedure, a total of 245 adaptations are found and classified. The paper shows a broad diversity of interdependent actors to be relevant-ranging from transportation providers to public and private actors and households. Crucial actors are hybrid in terms of being public or private. A substantial share of the identified adaptations follows a top-down adaptation policy pattern where a public or hybrid operator initiates action that affects private actors. Most of the exceptions from this pattern are technical or engineering measures. Identified adaptations mostly require institutional means, followed by technical means, and knowledge. Generally, knowledge on adapting transport to climate change is still in a stage of infancy. The existing literature either focuses on overly general adaptations, or on detailed technical measures. Further research is needed on the actual implementation of adaptation, and on more precise institutional instruments that fill the gap between too vague and too site-specific adaptations.

AB  - The interest of this study lies in the fact that the transition from a linear to a circular economy is of key interest in relevant business and academic fields, although the circular economy is an emerging issue and theoretical and empirical research has been limited until recently. However, circular business models are receiving more and more attention, and it is therefore strategically necessary to develop tools that facilitate their implementation. Therefore, because of increasing interest amongst research in the circular economy and sustainability, the purpose of the present study and its strength lies in the systematic presentation of both of these specific academic streams. The approach was qualitative and based on a systematic literature review. We examined several areas in which the circular economy has a place. We highlight sustainability, consumer behaviour, innovation, remanufacturing, operations management, supply chains, intellectual capital, 3D printing, big data, and recycling. We also consider drivers, challenges, the relationship between circular economy and small to medium-sized enterprises, and the influence of circular economy in specific sectors such as textiles and food. It is hoped that the study will facilitate a possible sustainable solution that contrasts with the current linear model of production and resource management. The circular economy has the potential to create positive synergies in economic, social, and environmental areas, despite its recent origin.

AB  - This paper is intended as a contribution to the ongoing conceptual development of sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) and provides initial guidance on becoming and being sustainable. The authors organize and integrate the diverse body of empirical literature relating to SOI and, in doing so, develop a synthesized conceptual framework onto which SOI practices and processes can be mapped. Sustainability-oriented innovation involves making intentional changes to an organization's philosophy and values, as well as to its products, processes or practices to serve the specific purpose of creating and realizing social and environmental value in addition to economic returns. A critical reading of previous literature relating to environmental management and sustainability reveals how little attention has been paid to SOI, and what exists is only partial. In a review of 100 scholarly articles and 27 grey sources drawn from the period of the three Earth Summits (1992, 2002 and 2012), the authors address four specific deficiencies that have given rise to these limitations: the meaning of SOI; how it has been conceptualized; its treatment as a dichotomous phenomenon; and a general failure to reflect more contemporary practices. The authors adopt a framework synthesis approach involving first constructing an initial architecture of the landscape grounded in previous studies, which is subsequently iteratively tested, shaped, refined and reinforced into a model of SOI with data drawn from included studies: so advancing theoretical development in the field of SOI.

AB  - Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions. In addition, a future research agenda is provided, which emphasizes the need for improved research generalizability, empirical validation, integrative addressing, and deeper analysis of relationships between practices and performance.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, supply chain sustainability has become one of the most dynamic and prolific decision management research fields. The volume of primary and secondary research articles continues to increase yearly with the introduction of emerging topics, new modeling and theoretical approaches, and multidisciplinary perspectives. Motivated by this body of literature, this study reviews key supply chain management concepts, sustainability perspectives, and methodological literature review features to support the systematic review of 198 surveys published between 1995 and 2018. The objective is to answer three research questions: which are the existent literature reviews on supply chain sustainability, what are their methodological features, and what are their main objectives and subject matters. Following a content analysis, the study maps and assesses the source material according to analytic categories pertaining to methodological and content features. The study shows that systematic literature reviews are becoming the standard method to conduct literature reviews on sustainable supply chain. However, frequently reviews fall short of meeting, and reporting the methodological rigor required by the systematic method. Although most reviews identified adopt a triple bottom line outlook on sustainability, social aspects continue to be underrepresented, namely in comparison with the environmental factor. This tertiary study renders a comprehensive critical survey of the current status of research on supply chain sustainability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Natura 2000 network is regarded as one of the conservation success stories in the global effort to protect biodiversity. However, significant challenges remain in Natura 2000 implementation, owing to its rapid expansion, and lack of a coherent vision for its future. Scientific research is critical for identifying conservation priorities, setting management goals, and reconciling biodiversity protection and society in the complex political European landscape. Thus, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation of published Natura 2000 research to highlight prevalent research themes, disciplinary approaches, and spatial entities. We conducted a systematic review of 572 scientific articles and conference proceedings focused on Natura 2000 research, published between 1996 and 2014. We grouped these articles into 'ecological' and 'social and policy' categories. Using a novel application of network analysis of article keywords, we found that Natura 2000 research forms a cohesive small-world network, owing to the emphasis on ecological research (79% of studies, with a strong focus on spatial conservation planning), and the underrepresentation of studies addressing 'social and policy' issues (typically focused on environmental impact assessment, multi-level governance, agri-environment policy, and ecosystem services valuation). 'Ecological' and 'social and policy' research shared only general concepts (e. g., Natura 2000, Habitats Directive) suggesting a disconnection between these disciplines. The UK and the Mediterranean basin countries dominated Natura 2000 research, and there was a weak correlation between number of studies and proportion of national territory protected. Approximately 40% of 'social and policy' research and 26% of 'ecological' studies highlighted negative implications of Natura 2000, while 21% of studies found positive social and biodiversity effects. We emphasize the need for designing inter- and transdisciplinary research in order to promote a social-ecological understanding of Natura 2000, and advance EU conservation policies.

AB  - Climate adaptation is part of the process our society is using to cope with climate change and the changes that it will bring to our environment over the coming years. Unfortunately, in some 'high-risk' industries (e.g., nuclear) and specifically in some areas such as spent fuel management, climate adaptation has received little attention. In 2016, the total spent fuel inventory was 265, 000 tonnes of heavy metal (HM) in storage and 127, 000 t HM was sent to reprocessing. In general, the spent fuel reduces its radiotoxicity to a natural level after hundreds to thousands of years. This timeframe surpasses that of severe changes that are expected to occur on our planet because of climate change. So, climate adaptation should be considered. As such, a literature review has been performed to acquire knowledge and identify gaps in the literature related to climate adaptation measures in long-term spent fuel storage. For this, a systematic review was performed that included the screening of 693 studies and a full-text analysis (e.g., purpose, methodology, findings, limitations) of 67 studies. Several literature gaps were revealed that included the lack of (1) local climate vulnerability assessment for nuclear power plants, (2) climate adaptation for spent fuel storage (e.g., on-site and centralized facilities (3) climate adaptation measures for long-term storage or final repositories.

AB  - Background Invasive alien plant species often have negative environmental and social impacts, such as loss of biodiversity and alteration of ecosystem services. As a result, managing the introduction, establishment, and abundance of invasive species is a major priority. To do this effectively, we need evidence on the effect of management interventions (such as using herbicide or cutting to control invasive plants). This evidence should not only include the effects of these management interventions on invasive alien species, but also on native species and other non-target outcomes such as ecosystem services. Such evidence would allow for comparison of the trade-offs between different management interventions. In the planned review we aim to assess how management interventions to control nine priority invasive alien plants species in England and Wales affect environmental outcomes. These species are: Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) Nuttall's waterweed (Elodea nuttallii), Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera tinctoria), Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), Floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Curly waterweed (Lagarosiphon major), American skunk cabbage (Lysichiton americanus), Parrot's feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum). Methods Searches will be in English and use bibliographic databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and Conservation Evidence) and internet searches (Google Scholar), as well as specialist databases. Our methodology will only use the names of each species (scientific names and common names, including synonyms) as our search string (we will not use qualifiers, such as "AND invasive"). This will give low specificity but will increase the likelihood of capturing all relevant information. We will use predefined criteria for study inclusion and data extraction. We will screen publications in two stages: (1) using titles and abstracts and (2) using full texts. Consistency of inclusion will be checked by two people screening a random sample of 10% of titles and abstracts. This dual-screening will be subject to kappa analysis and any disagreements resolved through discussion. We will use critical appraisal to assess study validity by identifying studies that are potentially prone to bias.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to systematically review and assess the current status of research on supply chain sustainability from a network structural perspective and provide an organising framework for future scholarship in this area.
   Design/methodology/approach
   By adopting an evidence-based approach, this study conducts a systematic review of 73 articles from 18 peer-reviewed journals published between 2000 and 2020.
   Findings
   Adopting a social network analysis approach, the review identifies specific node-level (i.e. degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality) and network-level (i.e. network density, network sub-groups and network diversity) structural properties that play a role in supply chain sustainability. The results reveal that structural properties determine the extent of perception of sustainability risks, the diffusion of sustainability targets, introduction of sustainable innovations, development of sustainability capabilities, adoption of sustainability initiatives and the monitoring of sustainability performance throughout the supply chain.
   Originality/value
   By distinguishing between supply network and sustainable supply network types, this study extends the existing understandings of the role of network connectivity patterns in supply chain sustainability through synthesising and evaluating the extant literature. This study further clarifies the role of these network structural properties in supply chain sustainability by describing their impact on a set of sustainable supply chain management practices through which firms achieve sustainability goals across their supply chains.

AB  - Farm sustainability issues are diverse but interconnected and complex. Many organizations have begun to promote packaged sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs). Some of these bundled SAPs (i.e. organic agriculture and integrated pest management) have long been employed by farmers, and studied by scientists seeking to understand their response to these alternative agricultural approaches. This paper reviews and synthesizes recent research in this area. It identifies key explanatory factors, which frequently lead to the adoption of bundled SAPs. Vote count analysis reveals that variables implying economic motivation and facilitation regularly explain farmers' behaviour. In addition, a new finding emerged, in which factors inferring higher learning and superior management capacity provided further indicators to adoption. In particular, the training that provided by non-governmental organizations and rural institutions complements change agents (i.e. public extension services). While this finding is novel, more research is required to generate better understanding of farmer reaction to bundled SAPs, particularly dynamic ones (i.e. private standards) in which farm business sustainability depends upon good agricultural practices being implemented.

AB  - In recent years, agriculture in the Andes has shown greater sensitivity to climate change, favoring processes of soil erosion, retreat of glaciers, loss of vegetation cover, increased intensity of rainfall and alteration in the dynamics of crops in the region such as: potato, quinoa, corn, among others. This motivated many authors to develop regional model simulations to estimate the vulnerability index of these agricultural systems to these climatic events, allowing them to provide a more reliable climatological data in the presence of hot and dry winds. In this review article, the main contributions provided by various researchers regarding the impact of climate change on Andean agriculture are detailed. According to the collected information, it is concluded that climate change in the Andes will cause countries such as Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia, to increase their local temperature, potential for evapotranspiration and water scarcity, causing the loss of important crops such as rice. In contrast, countries such as Peru, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Uruguay will register lower temperatures that will affect their production and yield in crops such as quinoa, potatoes, tarwi, among others.

AB  - Repairing materials for the construction has become the frequent topic of discussion now-a-days. The abundant number of concrete structures and hot-mix asphalt roads requires a massive demand of repairing materials. Instead of replacing the whole damaged structure, the feasible thing to do is by using the good repairing material considering the economic benefits. As, these days the most commonly used material for repair is polymer mortars and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as these materials are temperature sensitive and hence, they degrade so there is demand in industry to replace these materials by some novel materials which can sustain harsh weather conditions and one such material in the current context is found to be Magnesium Phosphate cement (MPC) which can replace the ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) is chemically bonded phosphate ceramic which is made by an acid-base reaction and generally the basic material is cationic metal and acidic one is phosphate and generally this process is expensive but there is a possibility of obtaining a MPC made by the low-grade magnesium oxide which can be acquired by calcination of natural magnesite. In this way, we can improve the structures by using new improved materials which in turn will reduce the costs of repairs in the long term in the building and transportation sector. In the present study, a systematic review for replacing ordinary Portland cement (OPC) by magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) is presented with detailed investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Grassland birds in North America have declined sharply over the last 60 years, driven by the widespread loss and degradation of grassland habitats. Climate change is occurring more rapidly in grasslands relative to some other ecosystems, and exposure to extreme and novel climate conditions may affect grassland bird ecology and demographics. To determine the potential effects of weather and climate variability on grassland birds, we conducted a systematic review of relationships between temperature and precipitation and demographic responses in grassland bird species of North America. Based on 124 independent studies, we used a vote-counting approach to quantify the frequency and direction of significant effects of weather and climate variability on grassland birds. Grassland birds tended to experience positive and negative effects of higher temperatures and altered precipitation. Moderate, sustained increases in mean temperature and precipitation benefitted some species, but extreme heat, drought, and heavy rainfall often reduced abundance and nest success. These patterns varied among climate regions, temporal scales of temperature and precipitation (<1 or >= 1 month), and taxa. The sensitivity of grassland bird populations to extreme weather and altered climate variability will likely be mediated by regional climates, interaction with other stressors, life-history strategies of various species, and species' tolerances for novel climate conditions.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the environmental impact of plasma gasification technology, and assesses its merits as a sustainable technology fitting within waste management strategies for the circular economy transition. It reviews prior published work on conventional and plasma gasification through an envi-ronmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) lens, extracting each LCA's impact categories for a systematic review by comparing each LCA's relative difference. Such review method has not been applied for gasification technology before. From the reviewed LCA, it is found that plasma gasification, given its simultaneous energy and materials recovery feature, has more environmental benefits over landfilling and incineration. For example, in terms of global warming potential, 67% and 61% of the reviewed LCA work agrees that plasma gasification is more environmentally sound when compared to landfilling and incineration, respectively. For conventional (non -plasma) gasification, 89% of the reviewed-LCA find it to have lower global warming impact than landfilling; however, only half (56%) of the reviewed LCA find conventional gasification to be beneficial over incineration for the same impact categories. This review has demonstrated the environmental superiority of plasma gasifi-cation over other Energy-from-Waste (EFW) technologies, and has presented its alignment with the circular economy principle of circulating products and materials at their highest value with a minimal environmental impact.

AB  - Rice is a conventional crop that is produced majorly in the South and the South-East regions of Asia, leading to the generation of a considerable amount of biomass (Rice Straw) in the fields during the harvesting process. Whereas, husked rice, rice bran and broken rice are handled carefully during the processing of rice, however, rice straw is left in the agricultural fields and subjected to open-field burning for the easiest way to get rid of this waste. During the burning process, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and Greenhouse gases (CO, SOx, NOx) are emitted to the atmosphere and tend to cause an adverse effect on soil characteristics, human health and the environment. Considering these problems, many studies have been carried out for the valorization of rice straw in the various technologies as a raw material for composting, paper production, power generation, mushroom production, gasification and pyrolysis, construction material, pellet production, silica extraction, feed for ruminants, biofuel production, as an adsorbent and biochar production. The present paper aims to review the aforementioned technologies on the basis of different parameters for the generation of value-added products. The data presented in the paper is expected to aid local authorities, researchers and stakeholders to improvise the current practices or to invent new possibilities for the sustainable management of rice straw.

AB  - Mauritia flexuosa is a key ecological and economic palm found throughout tropical South America. To inform improved management of M. flexuosa, we conducted a systematic review of published information about the ecology, livelihoods, and management of M. flexuosa, synthesized the information and identified knowledge gaps, and analyzed the spatial distribution of publications. A total of 143 documents (primary research, literature reviews, and grey literature) were reviewed. Most published information originates from Peru and Brazil, with a disproportionate number of documents based in the Loreto Department of Peru. Significant geographical gaps in published information exist, especially in the northern portion of the species range. Existing literature emphasizes M. flexuosa fruit, although leaves, oil, and other products play important roles economically. To improve M. flexuosa management, we recommend that future research focuses on: (1) M. flexuosa availability; (2) harvest and cultivation; (3) development of consistent methods and standards; (4) landscape-level issues like land use change; (5) M. flexuosa within broader systems; (6) spatial gaps in research; (7) long-term research; and (8) multi-and interdisciplinary approaches.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic review on the subject of environmental sustainability in the service industry of logistics service providers (LSPs) to analyse the advances of the literature on the topic and pick out appropriate research questions to investigate. The literature review has been performed using two academic databases and spans the years 1960-2014. The paper shows that despite the increasing number of papers on the subject, several areas of research are still being neglected. In particular, the paper highlights six main literature gaps concerning the classification of green initiatives, the impact of green initiatives on LSP performance, the evaluation of sustainability performance, the factors influencing the adoption of environmental sustainability initiatives, the customer perspective in the sustainable supply chain, and the information and communication technologies supporting green initiatives. Starting from these six gaps, eight research questions have been identified. These research questions represent possible emerging areas of investigation on the topic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental communication interventions are employed in nature-based tourism settings to achieve environmental protection. However, much still needs to be studied to understand what interventions work, how and why. This review summarises the research design and outcomes of 54 empirical studies, published in English-language peer-reviewed journals where communications were used to foster visitors' pro-environmental intentions or actual behaviours. Our analysis suggests that environmental communication can be a useful tool although mixed results were often observed. Personal interpretation interventions were slightly more common than non-personal communications, and produced a higher portion of positive changes in pro-environmental behaviors and intentions. The use of Theory of Planned Behaviour was most commonly observed. Research on the efficacy of environmental communications is increasing; we suggest priorities to guide this accelerating research activity. Under-researched communications approaches include visual communications and digital tools. Increased comparison of content and delivery modes within the same study and in different nature-tourism contexts is needed, especially with diverse populations (e.g. cultural) and distinct sub-groups (e.g. pro- vs. non-environmental market segments). We advocate for increased diversity of research methods (e.g. qualitative) and robust design (e.g. longitudinal) to better understand visitors' behaviours, with reduced use of attitudes, knowledge and intentions as dependent variables.

AB  - Marine ecosystems contribute to human well-being, e.g. through the promotion of nature-based recreational activities such as surfing, which is a benefit obtained from Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our research objective is to identify the benefits and impacts associated to surfing, and who are the main affected subjects and/or objects, achieving a better understanding of the sustainability status of this recreational activity. To this end, a bibliometric study and systematic review was carried out for the period 1965-2021. Benefits and impacts were collated and grouped according to their dimensional focus and type of effects in 6 groups (3-dimensional focus x 2 type of effects). The results revealed that since the beginning of 21st century surfing research topics are growing and diversifying. This review shows that implications of surfing go beyond direct users (i.e., surfers) and has consequences in diverse dimensions (environmental, socio cultural and economic), involving many stakeholders (e.g., scientific, and local communities). Most of the pieces of evidence collated in this research were related with the people who practice the activity and its social implications (psychological benefits as main benefit and injuries as main impact). Following an interdisciplinary approach, we obtained a holistic understanding of the surfing activity, not only in terms of the different dimensions addressed but on the sectors of the society that obtain benefits or are impacted by the activity. All of them should be considered and integrated to guarantee the sustainable management of this CES benefit.

AB  - Festivals are an important sub-field within event studies which, until recently, have not been studied as separate experiences. A systematic review of the emerging literature on festivals reveals several key characteristics. While festivals are diverse in nature and geographical location, scholarly interest focuses on five main themes: the motivations for organizing, funding and attending festivals; the experiences of festival attendees; the relationship between festivals and their local environments; the economic and sociocultural impacts of festivals; and the management of festivals. Despite growing interest in festivals as research sites, little attention has been afforded to investigating festival processes. In particular, considerations of how festivals are established, and which individuals are involved in their initiation and regular staging, offer opportunities for research. This paper highlights the significant role festivals play within their local communities, including their facilitation of social cohesion and regional identity. Our study reveals that the literature rarely discusses the development of festivals over time and the wider networks in which festivals are embedded. This critical review of festival research identifies various research gaps and directions for future research to develop theory and practical understanding of festivals.

AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization during recent decades are having dramatic effects on urban soil properties and lead to large discharges of pollutants, which inevitably affect the health of the soil, ecosystems and human populations. This paper provides a systematic review of the relations between urban soil and human health. First, it summarizes the organic and inorganic pollutants in urban soil and their potential risks to human health. Second, the relations between urban greenbelt land, soil microbial diversity and human health are also explored. Third, we propose that future research should focus on the integration of assessments of health risks with exposure pathways and site characteristics. Bioavailability-based risk assessment frameworks for pollutants in urban soil can elucidate the complicated relations between urban soil, pollutant exposure and human health in cities. Finally, management of urban soil and policy should be strengthened in the future to maintain its sustainable development and utilization. More effort should be directed to understanding the relations between soil microbial diversity, green space and human health in cities.

AB  - Conservation management is becoming increasingly resource intensive as threats to biodiversity grow through habitat destruction, habitat disturbance, and overexploitation. To achieve successful conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, we need to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of conservation interventions and provide an efficient framework through which scientific evidence can be used to support decision making it? policy and practice. We conducted the first formal assessment of the extent to which scientific evidence is used in conservation management through a questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews of compilers of protected-area management plans from major conservation organizations within the United Kingdom and Australia. Our survey results show that scientific information is not being used systematically to support decision making largely because it is not easily accessible to decision makers. This, in combination with limited monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness of management interventions, results in the majority of decisions being based on experience rather than on evidence. To address this problem we propose using an evidence-based framework, adapted from that used in The health services and explain how we are currently putting an equivalent framework into practice by establishing review and dissemination Units to serve The conservation sector.

AB  - Persistence of restored populations depends on growth, reproduction, dispersal, local adaptation, and a suitable landscape pattern to foster metapopulation dynamics. Although the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on plant population dynamics are well understood, particularly in grasslands, the population traits that control grassland restoration are less known. We reviewed the use of population traits for evaluating grassland restoration success based on 141 publications (1986-2015). The results demonstrated that population demography was relatively well-assessed but detailed studies providing information on key stages of the life cycle were lacking despite their importance in determining population viability. Vegetative and generative performances have been thoroughly investigated, notably the components of plant fitness, such as reproductive output, while genetic and spatial population structures were largely ignored. More work on the population effects of ecological restoration would be welcomed, particularly with a focus on population genetics. Targeted species were principally common and dominant natives, or invasive plants while rare or threatened species were poorly considered. Evaluation of ecological restoration should be conducted at different scales of ecological complexity, but so far, communities and ecosystems are over represented, and more focus should be directed towards a population approach as population traits are essential indicators of restoration success.

AB  - The growing demand for food, water, and shelter change the way people use land. These changes have affected or even caused conflict in several locations. However, conflicts do not erupt in isolation; they are the result of multiple interacting causes. There is limited structural understanding of these causes. In this study, we systematically coded case studies that report on conflict related to land-use change, including deforestation in commodity frontiers, agricultural development on common land, and urban development. Based on an analysis of 62 cases, we identified population growth, overlapping land rights, ethnic fragmentation, and economic inequality as the most frequently reported root causes, while rises in land prices was the most often reported proximate cause. Reported institutional causes suggest that the problem is not necessarily the complete absence of governance mechanisms, but rather that governance mechanisms are not fully equipped to deal with the complexities of the observed land-use changes.

AB  - The deployment of Blockchain technology in the tourism industry is already becoming a reality with the gradual emergence of innovative business models. At its core is the promise of improving the efficiency of the tourism service value chain and enhancing the quality of the service provided to the end customer. This paper analyses research trends focused on using Blockchain technology in tourism. The aim is to determine how this technology impacts the tourism sector and its sustainability. A systematic review, descriptive bibliometric analysis, and network analysis based on co-authorship, co-citation, and keyword analysis criteria, among others, have been used. The results reveal that the subject matter analysed is generating a growing trend in academic research in the fields of sustainable management and supply chain efficiency. The activities in the tourism sector that are incorporating this technology to a greater extent are those related to the areas of marketing, logistics, and smart business models, according to the data extracted from the analysis. This technology already enables the application of solutions that predict and promote tourist behaviour based on sustainable behaviour and consumption habits, generating value for the different stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose This study conducts a systematic review using 452 academic and industry articles from an initial set of 60,899 records obtained by 3 databases from 2012 to 2020. The authors compare and contrast blockchains with existing legacy systems. The authors identify existing regulation, accounting standards, guidelines and potential amendments in under-explored areas such as taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed auditing procedures. The study aims to highlight the trends, differences and gaps between academic and industry literature. The authors provide a behavioral, social, cultural, organizational, regulatory, ethical, accountability and managerial perspectives of blockchain adoption in accounting. Finally, the study develops two adoption frameworks. Design/methodology/approach The authors' study follows (Moher et al., 2009) and (Briner and Denyer, 2012) methodology to conduct the systematic review and the steps are mentioned below. The authors construct a final sample of 452 from a preliminary search of three multi-disciplinary databases from 2012 to 2020. First, the authors motivate the review and formulate the research questions. Second, the authors aggregate relevant literature from both industry and academia and implement quality assessments. Third, the authors analyze the literature and construct the final sample of articles. Fourth, the authors conducted textual analysis, keyword frequencies and identify gaps, trends and similarities between academic and industry literature and develop the authors' frameworks Findings The authors identify 3 (ABDC, B and A* ranked) journals as publishing top article numbers with the highest article count for 2017 with 96 articles in academia and 2019 for the industry with 21 articles. Second-highest publications for academia occur in 2018 with 77 followed by, whereas in the industry, publications occur in the year 2016 with 16 articles. Two co-authors appear most popular with 103 articles. Word clouds, a mind map and article theme counts are used to identify nine key research clusters: data management, financial applications, sustainability, accounting and auditing, business and industrial, education, governance, privacy/security and disruptive technology. Research limitations/implications Systematic reviews can have selection biases mainly due to search and selection criteria distortions when constructing the final sample of articles. The authors address selection bias by refining our search keyword combinations by using different permutations and using keywords from articles already collected. The authors employ three databases and review the reference list of articles collected to add more articles that may have been missed into our sample. In addition, to avoid inconsistent coding of domains/themes and interpretations, the authors carefully review our domain identifications and all our analysis twice independently using two research assistants to obtain the same conclusions. Practical implications The authors' unique contributions include reviewing additional papers, differentiating between industry, academic articles, common trends and gaps in much scattered prior literature. The authors identify existing accounting standards, guidelines, limitations and possible amendments required in future for blockchain adoption in accounting in taxation, accounting treatment of crypto-assets/liabilities and detailed audit procedures. Blockchains are compared with legacy accounting technologies and two frameworks for adoption developed.
   The authors' results could impact the understanding of existing regulation, accounting standards, future amendments, areas requiring clarity and future collaborative research between academia and industry across multi-disciplines. Practical implications to academics, professional bodies, regulators and industry practitioners exist. Social implications The authors' study identifies significant implications on organizations, environment, culture and society in general. The authors identify that social engagement projects may be easily initiated and implemented with decentralized accounting information systems. Transparency and efficiency would change organization culture, ways accountants and even employees interact with each other and community. Anonymity in blockchains can be used for criminal activities. Coding of negative social dynamics to smart contracts may persist. Transparency of personally identifiable information may place individuals at risk. Regulation and standards would need to identify equity, ethics in blockchains which notwithstanding energy consumption, and could enable environmental protection increasing societal sustainability. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares academic and industry literature of 452 articles to identify gaps and similarities from 2012 to 2020 using three multi-disciplinary databases. The authors' study is the first study to in detail existing accounting standards, unclear areas, future amendments for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards on taxation, financial reporting and all aspects of auditing procedures. The authors further categorize prior literature into these key areas and develop two frameworks (DAERPS and DAIS) that are linked to our review results and prior literature. The authors identify the impact of blockchain adoption on key stakeholders, regulation, society, culture, organization, accountability and ethics.

AB  - Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) is increasingly becoming a pressing issue in sustainability science, to deal with supply constraints of landscape and divergence in demand from local and global stakeholders. Agroforestry is a well acknowledged and established management practice to minimize the trade-offs, and to sustainably manage the contested landscapes while satisfying the growing demands of both local and global ecosystem beneficiaries. However, various facets of agroforestry, its management modality, institutional arrangements, and implementation outcomes are inadequately understood. This paper aims to scrutinize major agroforestry practices through the methods of systematic review of literature, government policies, and project reports. Taking a case of Nepal, this paper presents agroforestry transition from forest-based agroforestry (i.e., shifting cultivation) to farm-based integrated approach to agroforestry in Nepal. This paper reveals that integrated agro-forestry approach is crucial in creating win-win scenarios among various stakeholders by minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies among ES, especially food, fibre, and other ES (i.e., biodiversity, soil functioning, water, and climate regulation). Analysing socio-economic, ecological, and institutional factors that are affecting agroforestry for the last fifty years, we further suggest an integrated model of agroforestry which is replicable in other countries with similar socio-economic status, practicing subsistence farming system. The findings of the paper are crucial in awakening scholars, policy makers and landscape managers for up-scaling and out-scaling of integrated approach to agroforestry for ecosystem management and attainment of various sustainable development goals such as, no poverty (#1), zero hunger (#2), climate action (#13), and life on land (#15).

AB  - Effectively controlling and reducing the energy consumption of buildings is the global focus. A considerable variety of research on building energy saving (BES) had been raised in the past. However, most of the previous reviews focus on a single topic within the area, and systematic review and objective analysis are lacking. This study comprehensively reviews 2569 papers on BES published between 1974 and 2020 through bibliometrics, network mapping analysis and in-depth content analysis to fill this research gap. This paper discusses the development evolution and research trends in the field based on the analysis results, and the following three major research themes are identified and discussed: (1) influence factors of building energy consumption (BEC), (2) implementation of BES and (3) barriers and drivers of BES. Lastly, the current study indicates the possible potential research direction in the future; for example, intelligent integration of energy management and control system, quantitative and qualitative analyses of the interaction of BESM and comprehensive summary and quantitative analysis of the driving and hindering factors of BES. The contribution of this study is that it can help scholars and practitioners to have a comprehensive cognition of the research status and trends in the field of BES. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural soils provide multiple ecosystem services (ES) that can replace chemical inputs to support agricultural production. However, most arable cropping systems are managed with little concern for preserving ecological functions, which could reduce their ability to provide these ES. An increasing number of studies assess ES from agroecosystems, but analysis of multiple ES distinguishing relationships that may exist between them and between these ES and their drivers is lacking. Thus, we performed a systematic literature review of soil-based ES relationships, with a focus on temperate annual field crops. Forty relevant studies out of 870 were selected for the analysis. We created an original ontology of soil-based ES, based on the indicators used to assess them, to which we added soil-based negative impacts and biomass production (defined as a good) to combine the ES approach and the impact approach. We summarized each positive (synergy), negative (trade-off) or nonsignificant relationship in these studies, which were either quantitative or qualitative. We highlighted key relationships that have never been investigated in the corpus selected, such as relationships between C sequestration and physical soil quality regulation, soil erosion regulation or soil biodiversity. Relationships between biomass production and soil-based ES or impacts were investigated the most and were mainly non-significant. This suggests there are agroecological practices for which maximizing bundles of ES does not always decrease agricultural production. Relationships between soil biodiversity and soil-based ES were exclusively synergistic or non-significant. Summarizing effects of drivers of these relationships revealed that the three pillars of conservation agriculture - rotation diversification (with ley or legumes), soil coverage with cover crops and reduced tillage - and organic fertilization seem promising practices to help provide balanced bundles of ES and potentially reduce negative agronomic impacts. We highlighted potential trade-offs that should be consciously considered when adapting management strategies.

AB  - BackgroundOver the last two decades there has been an increase in the demand for land in Sub Saharan Africa, particularly from foreign agribusiness investment to provide food for an increasing human population. The majority of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simultaneously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial variations in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest number of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions.MethodsThis evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3) preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must contain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made extraction form. The resulting map will consist of a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and a heat map in the form of a matrix. By providing an overview of the evidence base the resulting map can inform future meta-analyses by showing where there is sufficient comparable data while guiding conservation interventions by indicating geographical areas where species are most at risk.

AB  - As an important domain of sustainability science, trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) is crucial for spatial planning to sustainably manage natural resources while satisfying the needs of local and non-local beneficiaries. However, there is still a growing debate in understanding, characterization, and visualization of the trade-off relationships. This paper systematically reviews a total of 473 articles, published in the last 16 years (2005-2020) through 135 academic journals, based on empirical studies conducted in over 80 countries, and led by the researcher from over 50 countries. Trade-off relationships are often visualized as spatial associations of ES, but very few articles have characterized trade-offs as the causal interaction among ES. More than two-thirds of the studies were carried out in temperate and sub-tropical regions, but we depicted an under-representation of the critical ecosystems in tropics. About 90% of the articles were based on funded research but the involvement of government institutions was very low (<10%). Trade-off analysis was based only on biophysical constraints of the ecosystem, as observed in more than 80% of the selected articles, without due regards of the divergence in utility functions of different stakeholders and ecosystem beneficiaries. This study identifies a total of 198 pairs of conflicting ES, of which the trade-off between crop production and carbon/climate services has the highest records of observation (i.e., as identified by 20% of the total studies). Further, this study identifies the major drivers (i.e., ecological and social) and stakeholders (i.e., land users and government agencies) of trade-off in ES, and major gaps in the analytical approach to understand the trade-off relationships. Based on our findings, we have discussed and recommended a number of research trajectories, including trans-disciplinary research considering both biophysical constraints and utility functions, in order to guide the future direction of sustainability science through the creation of win-win scenarios.

AB  - Background: Several studies have reported that clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in a variety of clinical areas are of modest or variable quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of an international cohort of CPGs that provide recommendations on pharmaceutical management of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).
   Methods and Findings: We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) on February 15th and June 4th, 2012 for CPGs meeting inclusion criteria. Two independent assessors rated the quality of each CPG using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Twenty-four guidelines were evaluated, and most had high scores for clarity and presentation. However, scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, and applicability domains varied considerably. The majority of guidelines scored low on editorial independence, and only seven CPGs were based on an underlying systematic review of the evidence.
   Conclusions: The overall quality of CPGs for glycemic control in DM2 is moderate, but there is substantial variability among quality domains within and across guidelines. Guideline users need to be aware of this variability and carefully appraise and select the guidelines that they apply to patient care.

AB  - It is vital to enforce the distinguished assimilation of sustainability entities in higher education (HE) and establish an academia-wide collective curriculum on sustainability in an efficient manner, in order to disseminate and stimulate thoughts with forthcoming generations. The remit of this paper is to document the available literature and map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy. This research adds to the available literature; moreover, it could also aid in the community comprehension of education in sustainable development (ESD) implementation and/or integration into higher education institutions (HEIs). We perform an attentive search in relation to education sustainable development (ESD) in three relevant electronic databases, namely, Web of Science (WoS), ScienceDirect and IEEE Xplore. The result of the review is a taxonomy that includes 148 articles published between early 2014 and mid-2019 that were then categorized into six classes, namely, the accomplishment of SD, awareness and commitment, evaluation and commentary, structural transformation, course coordination and university management. Additionally, we acknowledge varied involvement from different levels of communities supporting and promoting education to achieve sustainable development (SD).

AB  - With elephant numbers increasing in some parts of their range, and related conservation concerns including elephants' impact on vegetation and human-elephant conflict, management interventions have been used to artificially reduce elephant numbers, to stabilize populations locally and regionally, or to affect their spatial distribution. Interventions may have environmental, demographic, or social impacts, often unintended. We evaluated elephant management interventions, including both direct (contraception, vasectomy, translocation, hunting, culling) and indirect interventions (fencing, range expansion, corridors, water provision, and fire management). The study draws on evidence from across the range of African and Asian elephants, but with a focus on South Africa, through a systematic literature review using Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Google from 2007 onwards, i.e. covering the period since the publication of the 2008 Assessment of South African Elephant Management. We focus on the effects of management on elephants, and present information on success of each method, as well as its demographic effects. We also identified unintended consequences of the interventions, such as increased human-elephant conflict, irruptive growth rates, social disruption, inbreeding depression, truncation of migratory routes, excessive vegetation damage, and breakdown in social structure. Culling and trophy hunting had the most unintended consequences, and evoked the most negative sentiments among tourists. There was a large disparity in the research effort directed towards different interventions, and we highlight gaps where additional research is needed. Elephant management can be contentious, with polarized views, and the broader social and economic elements need consideration. Disservices such as human-elephant conflict need to be reduced, and increased attention paid to animal welfare, and the broader expectations of society in this regard.
   Despite the review not being restricted, our study is informed mainly by research carried out in South Africa, drawing in large part on the base created by the 2008 assessment, as well as the norms and standards for management interventions formalized in South African regulations. Furthermore, the aim of the review was to produce information that could be used to update current approaches to elephant management in South Africa. The review draws on publications outside South Africa where they are available, as knowledge gained elsewhere is crucial for improving management decisions. We believe that our study has wider application for use throughout the African savannah elephant range.

AB  - With global warming and increasing urbanisation, cities are at significant risk of problems associated with stormwater. Green infrastructure (GI), a stormwater management tool in use worldwide, can reduce the risk of urban flooding significantly. This paper used bibliometrics to present the state of the literature on GI planning principles for stormwater management. The analysis reveals that the number of GI-related studies has grown exponentially in recent years and is most closely related to the discipline of environmental sciences/ecology, with the majority of output coming from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Furthermore, the inductive analysis of a database served to identify the nine most widely discussed principles for GI planning, which are adaptability, connectivity, diversity, multifunctionality, multiscale, informatisation, integration, public participation, and sustainability. These findings can inform GI efforts to cope with the risks of stormwater in the context of climate change.

AB  - Introduction:
   After the 1990 to 1991 conflict in the Persian Gulf, many Gulf War Veterans began reporting numerous unexplained symptoms including, but not limited to, systemic pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and difficulty with memory/concentration. These symptom clusters are now referred to as Gulf War Illness (GWI). Although the etiology of GWI is still debated, as many as 250,000 former service members have been continually suffering from GWI since 1991, making the need for treatment urgent. A broad variety of treatments have been considered for GWI, but there has not been a broad and comprehensive assessment of what is known and not known about GWI treatment. We conducted a systematic review to catalogue the types of treatments that have been examined for GWI, to evaluate the effectiveness and harms of these interventions, and to identify promising and ongoing areas of future GWI treatment research.
   Materials and Methods:
   We searched electronic databases, trial registries, and reference lists through September 2019 for randomized controlled trial and nonrandomized controlled trial and cohort studies directly comparing interventions for Veterans with GWI to each other, placebo, or usual care. We abstracted data on study design, demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, quality, and strength of evidence (SOE) using prespecified criteria. We resolved discordant ratings by discussion and consensus.
   Results:
   We identified 12 randomized controlled trials, each of which examined a different intervention for GWI. We found moderate SOE that cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise, separately and in combination, were associated with improvements in several GWI symptom domains. There was low SOE of benefit from two mindfulness-based interventions and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Mindfulness-based stress reduction improved pain, cognitive functioning, fatigue, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whereas mind-body bridging improved fatigue, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep, although pain and other outcomes did not improve. Continuous positive airway pressure improved overall physical health, pain, cognitive functioning, fatigue, mental health, and sleep quality in a small study of Veterans with sleep-disordered breathing and GWI. We found moderate SOE that doxycycline is ineffective for GWI in mycoplasma DNA-positive Veterans and increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo. We also found 33 ongoing, single-arm pilot, or unpublished studies examining a variety of interventions.
   Conclusion:
   Cognitive behavioral therapy (moderate SOE), exercise (moderate SOE), and mindfulness-based interventions (low SOE) may be effective in improving several symptom domains in patients with GWI. Doxycycline was ineffective and associated with harms (moderate SOE). Larger, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm the benefits found in completed trials. A wide array of treatments are being assessed in ongoing trials. A sufficient evidence base will need to be developed to guide clinicians about which treatments are most likely to be effective in clinical practice and which treatments should be avoided.

AB  - Clinicians, patients, policy makers, fenders, programme managers, regulators, and science communities invest considerable amounts of time and energy in influencing or making decisions at various levels, using systematic reviews, health technology assessments, guideline recommendations, coverage decisions, selection of essential medicines and diagnostics, quality assurance and improvement schemes, and policy and evidence briefs. The criteria and methods that these actors use in their work differ (eg, the role economic analysis has in decision making), but these methods frequently overlap and exist together. Under the aegis of WHO, we have brought together representatives of different areas to reconcile how the evidence that influences decisions is used across multiple health system decision levels. We describe the overlap and differences in decision-making criteria between different actors in the health sector to provide bridging opportunities through a unifying broad framework that we call theory of everything. Although decision-making activities respond to system needs, processes are often poorly coordinated, both globally and on a country level. A decision made in isolation from other decisions on the same topic could cause misleading, unnecessary, or conflicted inputs to the health system and, therefore, confusion and resource waste.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is a multidisciplinary approach focused on achieving the sustainability of the whole society. This review aims to reveal the potential impact of the circular economy on quality of life. This systematic review analyzes studies dealing with the concept of circular economy and quality of life. The methodology process included a keyword search and three selection steps. A total of 39 studies were included in the analysis. We define four topics that emerged from the literature review i) urban sustainable development; ii) waste management; iii) material production and iv) human well-being. All these topics emerged in the literature dealing with issues of circular economy and its impact on the quality of life. We assume that it is implied that every step towards circular economy contributes to the life quality, but there is an evident lack of studies that measure that impact. In Serbia, a small number of researchers were involved in this topic, although it represents one step towards the objective of improving the state of the environment. This review of the literature should serve as a starting point for future research.

AB  - The recent advancements made in the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) have unveiled transformative prospects and opportunities to enhance and optimize the environmental performance and efficiency of smart cities. These strides have, in turn, impacted smart eco-cities, catalyzing ongoing improvements and driving solutions to address complex environmental challenges. This aligns with the visionary concept of smarter eco-cities, an emerging paradigm of urbanism characterized by the seamless integration of advanced technologies and environmental strategies. However, there remains a significant gap in thoroughly understanding this new paradigm and the intricate spectrum of its multifaceted underlying dimensions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leadingedge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.

AB  - The study systematically reviews sixty recent publications on the impact of climate change on gender-differentiated labour market by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. While focusing on the effect of climate shocks on rural areas in general and the farming sector in particular, the study is organised around three main themes: (i) agricultural labor market vulnerability, (ii) gender-specific effects, and (iii) adaptation mechanisms. Evidence suggests that women face unique challenges in disaster recovery due to their role as caregivers, unequal access to resources, labor market discrimination and cultural restrictions. The response of household labor supply to climatic stress is different in the short-run and the long-run. While the long-term strategy is contingent on their ability to diversify into non-farm livelihood alternatives and migration to distant places, rural households cope with climate shocks in the short run by relying on affirmative government actions, remittance income and participating in agricultural wage labor.

AB  - Despite the formal acknowledgment of sanitation as a fundamental human right, more than 600 million people still practice open defecation, most of them in poor countries. A part of this challenge is related to the type of natural environment such as floodable areas where flooding affects thousands of people every year and has a direct impact on their access to sanitation. Although there is a wide range of technological sanitation options for vulnerable communities, few publications explore their applicability to areas prone to constant natural floods, thereby hampering the possibilities for improving sanitation conditions in such areas. This review aims at compiling and consolidating current information on sanitation options for floodable areas with a focus on their technological, environmental, and managerial peculiarities. A systematic review identified 28 relevant publications presenting sanitation solutions for those environments. They were grouped into dry solutions and wet solutions. Our analysis showed that there is no single universal technology capable of solving the problem but instead, a set of different technological arrangements that could be implemented bearing in mind the environmental and social contexts in which they are inserted.

AB  - Currently, electrolyzed water, a sustainable and environmentally friendly disinfectant produced through electrolysis of an acid or salt, has become very popular because of its applications in various sectors such as health, agriculture, and food. Influencing factors are important for optimizing the electrolyzed water production process and maximizing application efficiency. Factors that influence the production and efficiency of electrolyzed water, including water and electrolyte properties, electrode material, current, storage, and application factors, were reviewed in this study. Moreover, some commercially available generator models, their specifications, and issues are discussed along with future recommendations. This work summarizes the available literature from January 2000 to December 2020, reporting studies that can assist in understanding various parameters affecting the production and stability of electrolyzed water. This can provide further insights and aid researchers in optimizing the process and address the issues faced by the existing systems by offering new perspectives in future studies.

AB  - Inclusive approaches have been applied in many areas, including human resources, international development, urban planning, and innovation. This paper is a systematic literature review to describe the usage trends, scope, and nature of the inclusive approach in the climate change adaptation (CCA) context. We developed search algorithms, explicit selection criteria, and a coding questionnaire, which we used to review a total of 106 peer-reviewed articles, 145 grey literature documents, and 67 national communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); 318 documents were reviewed in total. Quantitatively, the methodology reveals a slight increase in usage, with a focus on non-Annex 1 countries, gender issues, and capacity building. Qualitatively, we arranged the key insights into the following three categories: (1) inclusion in who or what adapts; (2) motivating inclusive processes; and (3) anticipated outcomes of inclusive CCA. We conclude, with the observation, that many issues also apply to Annex 1 countries. We also argue that the common language nature of the word `inclusive' makes it applicable to other CCA-relevant contexts, including government subsidies, science policy, knowledge integration and mobilization, performance measurement, and the breadth of the moral circle that a society should adopt.

AB  - Dams and other anthropogenic barriers have caused global ecological and hydrological upheaval in the blink of the geological eye. In the present article, we synthesize 307 studies in a systematic review of contemporary evolution following reduced connectivity and habitat alteration on freshwater fishes. Genetic diversity loss was more commonly observed for small populations impounded in small habitat patches for many generations behind low-passability barriers. Studies show that impoundments can cause rapid adaptive evolution in migration timing, behavior, life history, temperature tolerance, and morphology, as well as reduce phenotypic variance, which can alter adaptive potential and ecological roles. Fish passage structures can restore migratory populations but also create artificial selection pressures on body size and migration. The accelerating pace of dam removals and the paucity of data for fishes other than salmonids, other vertebrates, invertebrates, and tropical and southern hemisphere organisms highlights the urgent need for more studies on the rapid evolutionary effects of dams.

AB  - Rural road networks in low-income countries (LICs) and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) are critical for economic and social well-being. However, they are mostly unpaved, are of poor average condition, can be impassable after periods of rain and have high user costs. There is therefore a need to identify low-cost, proven sustainable solutions for rural roads in these countries. To this end, the UK Department for International Development commissioned a systematic review to identify and appraise technologies appropriate for low-volume rural roads that have enabled improved and sustainable rural access in LICs and LMICs. Its findings are summarised in this paper. The review found that there is an evidence base of engineering-related technologies (primarily associated with the use of materials and design philosophies) that could be used to improve the performance of gravel or earth rural roads and that proper construction and appropriate maintenance are vital for the technologies to be sustainable in physical terms. However, the review argues that, since there are few empirical studies demonstrating the sustainability of rural road technologies, expert knowledge is needed to support the implementation of its findings.

AB  - The creation and deployment of digital technologies throughout the agro-food system contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal nine. However, various digitalization studies offer limited insight into the policy issues and solutions around emerging technologies and big data systems in agriculture. There is a need for an additional understanding of how agricultural policymaking should respond to the usage of digital technologies in the agri-food sector. Furthermore, evidence is limited on how existing agricultural government programs such as land reform can be linked with digitalization policy. This systematic review of literature sought to determine the transformation that is needed in the political and economic environment for the digital revolution to take place within South African land reform agriculture. A thematic analysis of data sampled from ProQuest Central, Scopus, Dimensions, and Google Scholar reveals five areas of intervention from agricultural policymaking. The digital revolution in agriculture can be brought about by transforming digital infrastructure, data interoperability and governance, digital markets, the compatibility of government incentives with the private sector, and the digital cultural landscape. This essay contributes to agricultural policy and decision-making dialogues that pay attention to digital technologies and land reform programs in South Africa.

AB  - Urban logistics is one of the key elements of urban mobility planning. The use of real-time information systems in logistics operations generates an enormous amount of data, nowadays used mainly for the purpose of monitoring and control of large flows of goods. At the same time, urban planners, business stakeholders, and city admin-istrators are in need of adaptive, data-driven decision support solutions to address today's urban logistics problems. Recently, digital twins have received a lot of attention to support advanced experimentation, simu-lation and decision-making for on-demand logistics operations. Questions still remain on how to realize these for urban logistics management in a mixed public-private stakeholder context. We argue that this lack of a specific framework for city logistics with a model library for data mergers, linking physical and virtual data exchange, can compromise the timely adoption of digital twin technology. We contribute to filling this gap by presenting a systematic review of the literature, proposing a conceptual framework for digital twin applications in urban logistics, and providing use case scenarios for their demonstration. Together, these should advance the technical implementation of digital twins in a sustainable city logistics context.

AB  - Commons and social-ecological systems research examines institutional arrangements for governing natural resources to improve social and ecological outcomes. However, no universal definition of success exists. We examine the CPR and SES synthesis literature to identify trends, gaps and challenges for examining success. We address: (1) gaps in the literature, (2) multidimensionality and tradeoffs, and (3) and the link between problem orientation and definitions of success. To do this we conduct a comprehensive review of Large-N studies, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of CPR and SES governance (n = 45). We found seven dimensions of success, corresponding to collective choice, constitutional and operational levels, temporal dimensions, and socio-economic outcomes. Most studies did not address power and tradeoffs, or specify the social groups to whom success would apply. The majority of studies defined success in one dimension, most often demand-side provisioning (e.g., productivity or biodiversity). A regression analysis suggests that studies on rangelands or grasslands, correlative studies, and/or studies of state property systems (i.e., protected areas) were more likely to use fewer dimensions of success. Problem orientations often did not correlate with dimensions of success considered in a study, suggesting that measures of success often cannot adequately address the full suite of problems recognized in synthesis research. This presents a significant challenge for collective action among scholars who aim to develop general knowledge on SES and CPR governance. We discuss exemplary studies that measure success as multidimensional, address power and tradeoffs, and conclude with four recommendations for advancing the analysis of success.

AB  - Some scientists propose that the Earth has entered the Anthropocene-a new geological age in which human activities have become the driving force behind global environmental changes. Several disciplines outside the natural sciences have engaged with debates surrounding the Anthropocene, including International Relations (IR), in order to theorise their relevance in this new age. To pluralise this burgeoning research area and contribute to the updating of the IR discipline's engagement with the Anthropocene discourse, this study seeks to locate and highlight the Anthropocene themes and narratives related to the Asia-Pacific region. A systematic review of the literature reveals knowledge gaps in the IR discipline's engagement with the Asia Pacific as a unique region in the Anthropocene, encouraging a more robust analysis of regional or multi-level anthropogenic contributions, closer investigation of differentiated experiences of vulnerability, and further articulation of contextualised yet globally significant solutions to environmental threats. The mainstream scholarship needs to engage with the Asia-Pacific experience(s) in the Anthropocene considering the region's vulnerability to the challenges of the Anthropocene and, at the same time, responsibility for increased anthropogenic factors.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the increased research attention gained by sustainability in food supply chain management. Although previous review studies have focused on aspects such as traceability, food safety, and performance measurement, sustainability has rarely been considered as a means of integrating these issues. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on food sustainable supply chain management (FSSCM). Using systematic review methods, relevant studies published from 1997 to early 2021 are explored to reveal the research landscape and the gaps and trends. Findings The paper shows the building blocks and the main research directions in FSSCM, particularly considering the opportunities in "neglected" emerging countries. Insights are provided into the various elements of the sustainability supply chain in the food industry, which have previously been analysed separately. Originality/value Only a few researchers have systematically reviewed the literature or taken a bibliometric approach in their analyses to provide an overview of the current trends and links between sustainability and food supply chain management.

AB  - This paper suggests that the field of environmental governance, policy and planning (EGPP) may be seen as an (emerging) scientific field, which can be characterised as 'fragmented adhocracy', explaining the widespread failure to produce robust and cumulative knowledge. We argue that in order to produce reliable knowledge and to become credible in the realm of policy and planning praxis, EGPP research needs a major reform impetus. To this end, we propose three areas for reform, which cover (1) an agreed canon of definitions shared within the community, while being open to reinterpretations and novel concepts; (2) the stronger use of meta-analytical methods such as the case survey methodology, or systematic reviews, to cumulate published case-based evidence; (3) a systematic recognition of the institutional, political and social context of governance interventions, which becomes increasingly important to the extent that meta-analyses reveal general patterns and trends which nonetheless vary with context. For each agenda item, we briefly formulate the motivating problem and an ideal-typical vision to strive for, and sketch out the pragmatic, epistemological and normative limits to its realisation. We close with overall reflections on our research reform agenda and suggest pathways for implementation.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement in higher education institutions has received, as a topic, increasing levels of attention, especially in today's landscape. While universities move towards a more sustainable future and reshape their relationship with their stakeholders, both internal and external, the body of academic research on the matter has increased exponentially in recent years. This article attempts to perform a systematic review of extant literature on stakeholder engagement among universities. In total, 53 distinct and relevant articles were found through various electronic databases, such as IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Through a methodical screening protocol, featuring several inclusion, and exclusion criteria, this article presents four major themes of analysis, namely: the role of students as stakeholders and their peculiarities, modern methods of stakeholder engagement amid the digital era, sustainability reporting and sustainable development for universities, and organizational implications of stakeholder engagement. While some attempts to synthesize this specific literature stream have been made in the past, to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to review recent relevant literature on stakeholder engagement in higher education.

AB  - In pavement engineering, non-petroleum based materials are strongly sought as substitutes/improvers for asphalt. Bioasphalt production with biomass is the most common technique with economic, social and environmental benefits. This paper aims to conduct a literature review of asphalt upgrading with biomass in biochar or bio-oil by-products. A review of 80 scientific articles was carried out, which studied the conventional and rheological properties of asphalt with optimal percentages of biomodifiers addition, considering them as new technologies in road constructions. The results show that the dose and type of the biomaterial has a great influence as a modifier, since the performance of biomass-based bioasphalt guarantees positive reactions with a minimum addition of 1% palm oil up to 100% wood ash as a maximum. In conclusion, the higher the dose of biomodifier at high temperatures, the greater the improvement in viscosity, stability, penetration degree, softening point, indirect tensile strength, modulus of resistance, deformation resistance, fatigue resistance, skid resistance and moisture resistance of asphalt, besides having better oxidative aging conditions, since the asphalt binder is generally compatible with most biomaterials, being viable as a source of renewable, sustainable and quality energy.

AB  - The development of public transport in cities can facilitate multiple ways under the Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) framework in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from passenger mobility. Nevertheless, ensuring their integration and direction for moving toward low carbon mobility transitions is often challenging in practice. Urban experimentation has emerged as a governance model to foster innovations for climate change mitigation in cities while articulating a sustainable future. This paper aims to review how urban public transport experiments ensure the selection and consolidation of ASI measures to support low carbon mobility transitions. Our analysis is based on a systematic review of 41 documents gathered from peer-reviewed and grey literature databases. We find that experimentation is a critical platform for introducing novel ASI-public transport measures and exploring potential pathways toward the transitions through participative backcasting approaches. In our database, the experiments generally contribute to the rollout of LEV technologies and BRT systems, followed by the development of other ASI measures. Some of the experiments establish climate change targets to support low carbon mobility. Our review demonstrates that the experiments hold a pivotal role in developing niches for ASI-based measures and stimulating policy processes for the long-term transitions.

AB  - The study of peri-urbanization attracted attention in the final quarter of the 20th century, due to the pace it acquired worldwide and the implication that urbanization and overall settlement patterns have on social sustainability and development. Theoretical and conceptual achievements are remarkable. Multi-country collaboration has produced a growing body of research on sustainability and peri-urban settlements. There is a lack, however, of a review of the practices of peri-urban informal settlements, the predominant mode of urban expansion, mainly in developing and rapidly urbanizing regions of the world. The purpose is, then, to systematize, from recent literature, the knowledge of the context, challenges, and practices, as well as their impacts and potential courses of action, to ensure sustainability in human-natural complex of the territory beyond urban cores, suburbs, or slums. A systematic review approach was adopted, for articles published in reputable journals, with support of previous reviews, books, and reports. A pragmatist combination of content analysis and critical review identified core topics and highlighted contrasting views. An analytical framework is proposed. Four categories-drivers, challenges and practices, impact, and future trends-are proposed as an adequate approach to systematizing the literature. The review finds that the practices focus on service and resource provision, on regulations to approximate informal to formal institutions, and on an economy founded on the resource base and service provision. This review provides insights on future trends and research topics.

AB  - Over the years, energy is becoming an essential factor with an impact on social, economic, and environmental aspects. More than 2.5 billion people are connected to agriculture worldwide, so the importance of agricultural energy production has become increasingly important. This study provides a comprehensive review of renewable energy, environment, and farm publication trends. Two hundred articles from 1988 to 2022 were analyzed, with special attention devoted to the last three extreme years, using the Scopus database and the Bibliometrix tool for analysis and visualization. Research on this topic experienced significant developments after 2008, with many fluctuations being revealed. Historically, China and the USA were the most productive countries in agricultural energy production advancements. However, in the last three years, the research center's respective contributions have undergone major changes. China maintained its dominance, but the importance of the USA fell sharply, and new centers (India, Poland) appeared. Biogas is the most popular method which is used and searched in this area between 1988-2022 since it includes both sustainability and locality. However, between 2020-2022, the importance of the circular economy has been highlighted in the literature. Complex energy systems, dual use of land, and energy storage might be the most important challenges for future research.

AB  - The Indian Himalayan Region is home to nearly 50 million people, more than 50% of whom are dependent on springs for their sustenance. Sustainable management of the nearly 3 million springs in the region requires a framework to identify the springs most vulnerable to change agents which can be biophysical or socio-economic, internal or external. In this study, we conceptualize vulnerability in the Indian Himalayan springs. By way of a systematic review of the published literature and synthesis of research findings, a scheme of identifying and quantifying these change agents (stressors) is presented. The stressors are then causally linked to the characteristics of the springs using indicators, and the resulting impact and responses are discussed. These components, viz., stressors, state, impact, and response, and the linkages are used in the conceptual framework to assess the vulnerability of springs. A case study adopting the proposed conceptual model is discussed for Mathamali spring in the Western Himalayas. The conceptual model encourages quantification of stressors and promotes a convergence to an evidence-based decision support system for the management of springs and the dependent ecosystems from the threat due to human development and climate change.

AB  - Social-ecological network (SEN) concepts and tools are increasingly used in human-environment and sustainability sciences. We take stock of this budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term 'fully articulated SEN' studies, which specifically model unique social and ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill research gaps.

AB  - Given the substantial and diverse body of research on community flood risk management in the United States, there is a need to establish the current state of knowledge, synthesize the methodological dimensions of community flood risk management studies, and identify directions for future research on community flood risk management. The present study addresses these needs by conducting a comprehensive and systematic review of community flood risk management empirical studies in the United States. We searched three academic databases and identified 60 studies that met our selection criteria (e.g., study must be focused on flood risk management at the community level and conducted in the United States). Findings indicate that the number of studies on community flood risk management is increasing, most studies employ flood mitigation and flood impact as their dependent variables, the preferred analytical method is regression, and this literature is dominated by social scientists, among other findings. We discuss six themes that emerge, present four recommendations based on the gaps identified, and outline a robust research agenda for enhancing communities' resilience to future flood disasters.

AB  - Purpose: In light of the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, understanding the experiences, strategies and challenges encountered when trying to achieve substantial, sustainable weight loss is an important area to investigate. We systematically evaluated qualitative studies focusing on the accounts of individuals who have achieved sustained weight loss to create a comprehensive picture of the experience of sustainable weight loss.
   Methods: Included studies were peer-reviewed studies that qualitatively assessed the views and experiences of adults who previously had or currently have overweight or obesity who successfully lost weight and who subsequently maintained or regained weight. The evidence was systematically synthesized, which enabled the formulation of clear themes and recommendations.
   Results: The 15 chosen studies included the accounts of 294 individuals. We found that continuous monitoring and goal setting, driven by sustained motivation and encouraging experiences, while resisting ever present challenges and enduring discouraging experience encapsulates the experience of sustained, substantial weight loss.
   Conclusions: This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiences, strategies and challenges encountered when trying to achieve substantial, sustained weight loss. Additional research taking into account findings from this review and others of its kind will enhance the formulation of treatment protocols.

AB  - Estuarine macroalgae are important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, and often foundation species providing structurally complex habitat Climate change alters many abiotic factors that affect their long-term persistence and distribution. Here, we review the existing scientific literature on the tolerance of key macroalgal species in the Baltic Sea, the world's largest brackish water body. Elevated temperature is expected to intensify coastal eutrophication, further promoting growth of opportunistic, filamentous species, especially green algae, which are often species associated with intensive filamentous algal blooms. Declining salinities will push the distributions of marine species towards south, which may alter the Baltic Sea community compositions towards a more limnic state. Together with increasing eutrophication trends this may cause losses in marine-originating foundation species such as Fucus, causing severe bio-diversity impacts. Experimental results on ocean acidification effects on macroalgae are mixed, with only few studies conducted in the Baltic Sea. We conclude that climate change can alter the structure and functioning of macroalgal eco-systems especially in the northern Baltic coastal areas, and can potentially act synergistically with eutrophication. We briefly discuss potential adaptation measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable consumption has been enacted as a strategy that helps the efficient management of natural resources. Therefore, this article makes a systematic review of the information on the current state of scientific research related to sustainable consumption in tourism. The main objective is to analyze the evolution and main characteristics of the works during the period 1990-2020. Once the review was performed in the Redalyc, Scimago and Scopus databases, 128 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. From the use of the Atlas ti 8 software, it was possible to code and group the objectives and areas of application of this type of consumption. The results show the following frequency in relation to the objectives: good practices-offer 55.45%; 2) consumer-demand habits 38.3% and 3) public policies and environmental regulations 6.25%. On the other hand, the areas where this type of practice is implemented are: lodging establishments 63%, food and beverage establishments 25%, means of transport 10% and events 2%. The software used also allowed us to analyze, through a co-occurrence table, the relationship coefficient between the objectives of sustainable consumption and innovation, this being positive (0.72).

AB  - The modernization efforts of the irrigation subsector in Kenya have been hampered by several challenges. This review describes the status and challenges facing irrigated agriculture in Kenya. The results indicated that as of 2018, the developed irrigation schemes covered an area of 222,240 ha, which is 16% of the irrigation potential of 1.34 million ha. Most large-scale irrigation schemes use the furrow system. Private and commercial farms and smallholder irrigation schemes use modern irrigation systems. The major challenges to irrigation development are technical, socio-economic, and institutional. The main technical challenges include poor water infrastructure, water scarcity, and poor water quality. The main socio-economic challenges include the high cost of modern irrigation systems, inadequate credit facilities, and market inaccessibility. The institutional challenges include the existence of a pluralistic legal framework, inadequate participation by farmers, including women farmers, and poorly organized irrigation water user associations. However, the future of irrigation development is bright through climate change adaptation strategies such as solar-powered irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting.

AB  - The scope of this systematic review was to analyze the impact of the Food Acquisition Program on the diversification of production, on-farm consumption and food and nutritional security of the family-based farmer and supplier beneficiaries. Searches were conducted in the Lilacs and SciELO electronic databases and the Capes journal portal. The publications were pre-selected based on their titles, followed by reading of the abstracts and the full text of the studies. Articles that evaluated the program's implementation, along with those that referred to food and nutrition security of consumers who benefitted from the program, as well as repeat and review articles, were excluded. Of the 193 studies reviewed, 7 were chosen. In all of those selected, there were positive impacts of the Food Acquisition Program on increasing family income, benefiting from access to the market and moving their produce. This made it possible to improve the production system and fostered crop diversification both for trade and for on-farm consumption of the families, having a positive impact on the food and nutrition security situation of the farmers.

AB  - Environmental knowledge is attracting interest in the area of sustainability due to the importance of both the environment and knowledge. As tourism is one of the biggest employers and sectors of economic development, environmental knowledge in hospitality represents a worldwide challenge. The present study aims to provide a clear understanding of the impacts and implications of environmental knowledge in the hospitality industry in a COVID society, taking into account its general areas of evolution through a systematic review methodology using a bibliographic database over time (26 years). We reviewed 944 documents collected from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database and analysed them using the Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT). In a world in which the environment is more deteriorated, it is important to be aware of the advance in environmental knowledge to take care of it and eliminate environmental degradation. This study adds value to the orchestration of knowledge by focusing on predictors that impact environmental knowledge. The results identify the development status and leading trends in environmental knowledge research to fall in love with the future in a COVID society. Falling in love with the future is possible in the hospitality industry.

AB  - Conflicts of objectives in agriculture are often very complex and require a comprehensive and interdisciplinary discussion so that sustainable solutions can be developed. Against this background, this thesis aimed to combine natural science and humanities (Christian ethics). For this purpose, this thesis discussed the conflict of objectives between high-performance breeding and the preservation of animal genetic resources in dairy cattle. First, a systematic review was conducted on a review question according to the method of PAGE et al. (2021). Then, the holistic approach in Jewish-Christian spirituality and the social teaching of the Catholic Church was presented. The focus here was on the social encyclical Laudato si' of the Holy Father Francis On Care for the Common Home (2015) (PAPST FRANZISKUS, 2015). From this, six evaluation criteria were formulated for the Christian ethical assessment of the conflict of objectives. The conflict of objectives was evaluated on the basis of these. Subsequently, conclusions and recommendations for action for farmers, processing, trade or business, politics and consumers were formulated. Finally, it was shown which further possibilities still exist to deepen the discussion of the considered conflict of objectives.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) to address societal challenges have been widely recognised and adopted by governments in climate change and biodiversity strategies. Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for. The recognition of the value created by these activities is essential for designing effective policy support measures, and for market development of the sector and its potential to facilitate the wider adoption of NBS.

AB  - Planning and managing the rapidly growing cities in a manner that delivers a balanced solution for their environmental, social and economic long-term development constitutes one of the grand challenges of societies. In the urban planning field, several sustainability assessment systems emerged to guide the planning process towards these goals. After two decades of existence, there is a need to further analyze the lessons learned from the application of these systems and discuss the pathways towards more sustainable societies. This paper provides a literature review of the most widely used urban sustainability assessment systems: BREEAM Communities, LEED Neighborhoods, CASBEE Urban Development, Green Star Communities, and DGNB Urban Districts. Here, we analyzed 124 publications on the topic published between 2015-2018, using the selected assessment systems as keywords. This study revealed that there is a need for context customization of global targets into local actionable measures; involvement of regulatory bodies to ensure the successful application of such systems; and, consideration of socioeconomic factors as the assessment is still very focused on the environmental impact. This study provides insights for practitioners and researchers on the existing systems to assess urban sustainability and pathways for future research.

AB  - Horticulture is essential in the European agricultural sector and fundamental for many EU member states. Decision Support Systems and Tools can play an essential role in a shift to result-based agriculture and evidence-based decision making, improving productivity and environmental performance of farming practices. Investigations have been conducted on horticulture crop and farming impact on the environment and Green House Gas emissions. Despite the availability of a broad spectrum of tools, the use of Decision Support Tools in agriculture in Europe could be much higher. This research aims to analyze and recommend environmental impact Decision Support Tools for small and medium-sized companies to approach, measure, and evaluate horticulture farming. The research methodology includes a systematic review, bibliometric analysis, Multicriteria Decision analysis, and a case study analysis. During the research, multiple tools, including calculators used for an impact assessment of the agricultural sector, were selected. After applying eligibility criteria, an in-depth analysis of eight of the most suitable calculators was performed. The results of the Multicriteria Decision analysis show that the Solagro Carbon Calculator, The Farm Carbon Calculator, and the Cool Farm Tool are recommended in the first place as Green House Gas calculators for farmers.

AB  - This article identifies and analyses environmental and institutional factors affecting renewable energy initiatives in a developing country, namely Ethiopia. It employs qualitative data and an innovative environmental scanning model (ESM) to gauge the effect of political, economic, social, technological, ecological, cultural, and historical (PESTECH) factors on renewable energy production and consumption in the country. Some factors are shown to serve as facilitators while others act as barriers renewable energy initiatives in the country. The following factors, an anti-private business climate in the energy market, lack of technical know-how, and scarcity of financial and skilled human resources emerge as leading barriers. The country's largely untapped renewable energy resource base, indigenous knowledge of renewable energy sources, and the government's avowed commitment to promote renewable energy demand and supply are found to be the prominent facilitators. It is recommended that the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) seeks to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector from domestic and international entrepreneurs. Additionally, the option of enlisting foreign capital input to meet the high upfront cost of developing renewable energy infrastructure should be accorded serious consideration. The main findings and these recommendations are potentially valuable not only for researchers and policy makers in Ethiopia but also other developing countries.

AB  - Objective. The global resurgence of dengue has been attributed to rapid population growth, urban expansion, increased air travel, globalization, and climate change. Dengue is now endemic in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is at risk for Zika, another emerging arbovirus. The interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors that affect dengue and other arboviruses' transmission is understudied. Design. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the interrelationship between climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors on dengue transmission in Puerto Rico and to draw lessons for Zika response. Results. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journal articles was performed, producing 562 articles; 26 were selected for this review. Findings indicate that human activities and behaviors (urbanization, migration, and consumption) as well as climate have a significant impact on the abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti, the vector for dengue, Zika, and other viruses. Conclusion. Despite the public health burden of dengue limited investments have been made in research and surveillance. Future research is needed to develop models that integrate the multivariate effects of climatic, ecological, social, and cultural factors, which for Puerto Rico have mostly been examined independently. Such models have the potential to inform response to dengue, Zika, and other arboviruses.

AB  - While many studies have explored the value of water, little is known concerning the meaning of water for Australian river communities. This rapid literature review provides an overview of the recreational, cultural, and environmental meaning of water for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian river communities and notes important connections between these relationships. Consequently, this review adds a critical dimension to water management debates by privileging community voices. Most papers explored cultural and environmental aspects rather than recreational relationships with water, with the majority of papers exploring Indigenous cultural and environmental meanings of water and fewer papers focusing on these meanings of water for non-Indigenous people. Our review shows that the meanings of water are understood very differently in cultures, with Indigenous water relationships marginalized by a dominant culture. Understanding the multiple dimensions of hydro-social relationships is critical to socially and environmentally just water management and to people's health.

AB  - Compared to modern cities, historical cities of fragile urban fabric are more vulnerable to natural hazards and climate change. Many existing academic publications have respectively studied urban climate risk and historical urban landscape management, but rare has systematically reviewed studies across the two fields. This review article provides a thorough understanding of how studies of urban climate and historical urban landscape inform and overlap with each other in a global scope from 1995 to 2021. The main aim is to raise academic awareness of the importance of addressing climatic issues in historical urban landscape studies and incorporating the proper cultural practices from the past into future urban climate management. This review finds a series of gaps in current literature, including insufficient academic attentions in this field, lack of collaborations across disciplines, isolation of cultural and natural knowledge, and lack of inclusiveness of climatic topics and case areas. Instead of focusing purely on urban climate, more research should integrate inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary findings addressing climatic, social, economic, and cultural issues in the development of historical urban landscape and discuss possibilities of their practical implementation. Substantial communication and collaboration between scholars from nature and culture sectors in this emerging field are also suggested to theorize the historical cultural wisdom and learn from successful urban models with a special focus on design and strategic planning so as to strategize for urban resilience and conservation.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals and the World Health Organization have prioritized senior mental health as an important goal. Senior mental health is a critical issue within the global public health sphere. Notably, green spaces are a useful alternative for improving senior mental health. Many studies have focused on green space and senior mental health, especially on their connection and relationship. However, this research topic lacks a comprehensive and systematic review. Owing to the lack of critical reviews, this study clarified the trend, progress, status, and focus of studies on green spaces and senior mental health using bibliometric analysis of literature within the Web of Science database. The literature analysis within this study specifically focused on the following, including the country/region contribution analysis, institution contribution analysis, keyword analysis, and highly productive journal analysis. Furthermore, this study systematically recorded the content of green space and senior mental health, identified the gap that exists, and provided future frontier directions or issues for research.

AB  - Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been gaining relevance in the academic, business, and political worlds, the relationship between CSR and performance remains unclear. This study provides a better understanding of the relationship between companies' financial performance and CSR activities. In other words, can the allocation of company resources to address social, environmental, and governance issues be a source of synergy to increase business value and improve financial performance for the benefit of the company and its stakeholders? To shed new light on this issue, we mapped this topic via a systematic review and content analysis of 53 articles identified in the confluence between CSR and financial performance from 1984 to 2021. Our study suggests that CSR directly impacts a company's financial performance, and this impact becomes more significant as the company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores improve. Moreover, we must note that this is a comprehensive study whose results include analyses of companies from the world's largest stock market indices, mutual funds, sustainable portfolios, non-sustainable portfolios, regions, asset classes for ESG investing, emerging markets, developed and developing countries, among others. Additionally, this study provides a path for future research.

AB  - Despite many studies of the drivers of deforestation, few syntheses have been conducted of the effect of public policies on forest cover. This is problematic because policy is the primary tool that society can use to change outcomes, yet we lack information on the conditions which lead to successful policies. To address this deficiency, we conduct a meta-analysis of case studies of the impact of public policy on deforestation and reforestation in Central America and Mexico, drawing on a set of 159 studies. This region has recently experienced high rates of forest cover change and is well studied, providing a strong sampling frame. For each study, we record the reported change in forest cover, along with the scale and location of the study, the types of policy evaluated, and other relevant information. Some policy types are strongly associated with positive or negative forest impacts, though important gaps remain in our understanding. Nearly all studies of payment for ecosystem services indicate an association between payments and improvements in forest cover (88% of cases), however this evidence derives from only two countries (Mexico and Costa Rica), both of which. have more clearly defined property rights and stronger governmental institutions than other countries in the region, raising questions about generalizability. Community-based management is associated with positive impacts on forest cover in 81% of cases, whereas protected areas are associated with positive impacts in 66% of cases. Studies of social and agricultural policies were rarer and more likely to be associated with negative outcomes. Agricultural subsidies were associated with negative forest outcomes in 86% of cases, raising the possibility that reducing agricultural subsidies could be an effective strategy for improving forest cover. Most studies do not adequately identify either causal effects or the mechanisms associated with policy change, and few studies examine interactions between policy types. The results of this review imply that, while some policies are more likely to make positive contributions than others, policymakers should remain cautious about the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of policies for reducing deforestation.

AB  - Green building is an essential component of sustainable development, but previous studies have offered little in the way of systematic reviews of green building development from the perspective of project management. This research presents the current research trends in this discipline by analyzing the publications in ten major international journals from 2007 to 2016. The analysis was conducted on papers that have reported relevant investigations during that 10-year period. The analyzed research topics were found to group into five themes: green building management in general, the benefits and barriers to green building development, green building performance, stakeholder behavior with regard to green buildings, and green building strategies. Future directions for research relating to green building are suggested for the areas stakeholder management, policies and incentives, communication platform development, and retrofitting of existing buildings. Green building development will continue to be an important research area, and more comprehensive studies on green building management can help to promote further progress in this field.

AB  - The challenges smallholders face in agricultural management between developed and developing countries differ and can also impact the smallholder's well-being. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that affect the well-being of smallholders. We conducted a systematic literature by applying the Preferred Reported Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and extracted 30 articles from Scopus and Web of Science. These articles show three main factors that drive well-being: technology, optimal resource, and insurance, and two additional factors: market pricing and tax policy. Findings show that all the above factors will first impact economic well-being and, subsequently, social well-being. When COVID-19 struck, the smallholder's well-being was also affected in addition to the destabilised food chain. Travel restrictions have led to a labour shortage. The smallholders had to turn to e-commerce to sell their products. They also incurred losses and experienced difficulties in procuring agricultural intermediate inputs. The absence of agricultural insurance worsened the impact on the well-being of the smallholders. To safeguard the well-being of these smallholders, the study suggests that stakeholders should encourage local labour participation, increase investment in human capital, adopt e-commerce in marketing, offer agricultural insurance schemes against various disasters and continuously provide or increase subsidies to smallholders.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that climate adaptation responses that do not incorporate equity considerations may worsen inequality and increase vulnerability. Using data from a systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical research on adaptation responses to climate change (n = 1,682), we present an assessment of how social equity is considered in adaptation across regions, sectors, and social groups. Roughly 60% of peer-reviewed literature on adaptation responses considers social equity by reporting on which marginalized groups were involved in planning or implementation. Articles on responses in Africa and Asia and those focusing on poverty reduction most frequently considered social equity. Equity was less likely to be considered in adaptation responses in Europe, Australasia, and North America, as well as in literature focused on cities. Income-based inequity was more frequently considered than gender, age, or Indigenous status. Ethnic and racial minorities, migrants, and people with disabilities were rarely considered. Attention to the levels and forms in which equity is integrated into adaptation research and practice is needed to ensure just adaptation.

AB  - Growing demand for renewables and sustainable energy production contributes to a growing interest in producing high quality biomethane from biogas. Despite having methane (CH4) as its main component, biogas may also present other noncombustible substances in its composition, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N-2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Contaminant gases, such as CO2 and H2S, are impurities known for being the main causes for the decrease of biogas calorific value and corrosion, wear of pipes, and engines, among others. Thus, it is necessary to remove these compounds from the biogas before it can be used in applications such as electricity production, thermal purposes, and replacement of conventional fossil fuels in vehicles, as well as injection into natural gas distribution networks. In this context, the present work aimed to present a systematic review of the literature using the multicriteria Methodi Ordinatio methodology and to describe processes and materials for H2S removal. The discussion indicated new materials used, as well as the advantages and disadvantages observed and the limitations in industrial implementation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands restoration is an emerging field which aims to recover the ecological characteristics of degraded ecosystems to natural ones. The recent UN declaration of 2021-2030 as the "Decade on Ecosystem Restoration" will hopefully encourage global implementation of these projects. However, a lack of common indicators of restoration success hinders our knowledge on the ecological outcomes of restoration projects. We conducted a literature review to determine trends in monitoring indicators. We classified indicators following the Society for Ecological Restoration template, adapting it to coastal wetlands. We found that indicators on structural diversity (e.g., tree height, fish size) were the mostly commonly used. Indicators on ecosystem function were the second most investigated, with half of the assessed studies including them, especially those focusing on carbon, nutrient and sediment dynamics. We propose a recovery wheel framework adapted to coastal wetlands. Structural diversity indicators are generally easier to measure and often the traits that recover the fastest. However, ecosystem function indicators could be more important to assess the recovery of ecosystem services, which is a primary objective of restoration. Restoration objectives and goals are variable for each project, and we encourage future restoration projects on coastal wetlands to select the most appropriate indicators on the basis of the recovery wheel proposed in this study to plan a monitoring framework. Future studies assessing coastal wetlands restoration ecological outcomes should include ecosystem function indicators and monitor the sites over periods adequate to their recovery.

AB  - Within the urban context, heritage conservation has been acknowledged as fundamental for sustainable development. This paper address the need to develop methodologies that enable understanding of the dynamics between these two fields that for long were regarded as opposing practices. The research crosses disciplinary boundaries through a mixed methodology that identifies 27 urban development common indicators as factors that are affecting the conservation of 69 World Heritage Cities (WHC). Indicators, which were selected from global urban monitoring tools, were analyzed within UNESCO State-of-Conservation reporting system. Results reveal key trends on urban factors assessed as a SWOT analysis in relation to the management of WHC. We argue that urban indicators can facilitate the understanding of development impacts in cultural heritage conservation, across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. This paper contributes to the debate on the ability of indicators to bridge interdisciplinary and methodological issues that were related to common conceptualizations between urban development and heritage conservation and sustainability. The conceptual approach that is presented has proven to offer an empirical basis for a monitoring practice that fosters the sustainable management of urban heritage, which in the light of the New Development Agenda and the gaps in the state-of-the-art, is very much needed.

AB  - Agenda 2030 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 11 recognizes tourism as one of the central industries to global development to tackle global challenges. With the transformation of information and communication technologies (ICT), e-tourism has evolved globally to establish commercial relationships using the Internet for offering tourism-related products, including giving personalised suggestions. The contextual suggestion has emerged as a modified recommendation system that is integrated with information-retrieval techniques within large databases to provide tourists with a list of suggestions based on contexts, such as location, time of day, or day of the week (weekdays or weekends). This study surveyed literature in the field of contextual suggestion and recommendation systems with a focus on e-tourism. The concerns linked with approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems are highlighted in this systematic review, while motivations, recommendations, and practical implications in e-tourism are also discussed in this paper. A query search using the keywords "contextual suggestion system", "recommendation system", and "tourism" identified 143 relevant articles published from 2012 to 2020. Four major repositories are considered for searching, namely, (i) Science Direct, (ii) Scopus, (iii) IEEE, and (iv) Web of Science. This review was carried out under the protocols of four phases, namely, (i) query searching in major article repositories, (ii) removal of duplicates, (iii) scan of title and abstract, and (iv) complete reading of articles. To identify the gaps in current research, a taxonomy analysis was exemplified into categories and subcategories. The main categories were highlighted as (i) review articles, (ii) model/framework, and (iii) applications. Critical analysis was carried out on the basis of the available literature on the limitations of approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems. In conclusion, the approaches used are mainly based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, preference-based product ranking, and language modelling. The evaluation measures for the contextual suggestion system include precision, normalized discounted cumulative, and mean reciprocal rank, while test collections comprise Internet resources. Given that the tourism industry contributed to the environmental and social-economic development, contextual suggestion and recommendation systems have presented themselves to be relevant in integrating and achieving SDG 9 and SDG 11 in many ways such as web-based e-services by the government sector and smart gadgets based on reliable and real-time data and information for city planners as well as law enforcement personnel in a sustainable city.

AB  - Lack of public support for coastal adaptation can present significant barriers for implementation. In response, policy makers and academics are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation, which requires a deeper understanding of peoples' preferences for coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred, often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication for adaptation research and practice.

AB  - . This chapter presents a narrative synthesis of the evidence relating to the effectiveness of 13 different approaches (interventions) that have been incorporated into national suicide prevention programs. These approaches are presented in an analytic framework that distinguishes between national and community-based multilevel programs, prevention, and treatment/maintenance. The primary source of evidence are six reviews of reviews published since 2005, supplemented by a small number of systematic reviews and primary studies. We report strongly supportive evidence concerning the effectiveness of structural interventions (restrictions on access to bridges, tall buildings, and railways) and restriction on access to pharmacological agents. Weakly supportive evidence of effectiveness is available for community-based multilevel programs; restrictions on access to firearms and ligature points in institutional settings; settings-based programs (in schools, communities, workplaces, prisons, and the armed forces); education and training targeted at primary care physicians; lithium; cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy; and brief contact. There is insufficient or conflicting evidence concerning the effectiveness of the remaining approaches. We conclude that the evidence base for effective suicide prevention is far from convincing. Major improvement in the extent and quality of collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners and a considerable increase in funding for evaluation studies in suicide prevention are required if the current knowledge gap about effective interventions is to be bridged.

AB  - Sustainability Rating Systems are standard methods for achieving sustainable development of buildings and urban landscapes. However, they suffer from low adoption and implementation rates, mainly due to labour-intensive evaluation processes. This study explores how recent advancements in big data, combined with the availability of new urban environment datasets, could advance sustainability rating systems in landscape development. We compared between existing computational technology (supply) and industry performance evaluation needs (demand) using a systematic review and survey of Israel's professional communities as a case study. Of the existing indicators, Israeli professionals prioritised measuring socio-ecological indicators of landscapes in development projects, mainly at the urban level. Our review revealed that this level also holds available big data sustainability evaluation methods and technologies. Specifically, directed data for measuring ecology and volunteered and automated data for measuring social indicators. Such supply-demand links could significantly advance evaluation methods towards achieving a broader application of sustainable urban development.

AB  - Research studies on mode shift toward sustainable transport, particularly cycling, have become more common in the last decade. Despite some success in increasing cycling usage, there exist many barriers, both environmental and societal. This study provides a review of the key equity findings to date in cycling usage and identifies knowledge gaps. Barriers to cycling from an equity perspective are examined from three perspectives: policy and planning, infrastructure and cycling facilities, and population groups. The review includes both peer-reviewed and grey papers. Using a systematic review process, out of 73 documents, 33 which met the scope of the study were carefully examined. The review showed that accessibility is the most common measure for bicycling equity. A key knowledge gap is the lack of robust measures to determine inequities in cycling and evaluate the distribution of benefits across population groups. This is attributed to the lack of measures to effectively evaluate a program or policy from an equity perspective. Consequently, this review emphasizes the need to develop and evaluate equity measures for effective policymaking, to ensure that the needs of different population groups are met. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, given the identified knowledge gaps.

AB  - The recent and projected upward trends in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced events in cities have enhanced the focus on adaptation. In addition to enhancing the capacity of cities to prepare for and absorb risks, adaptation measures provide multiple co-benefits. However, health co-benefits are among the least explored. These are now seen as increasingly important with the renewed focus on public health since the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviews literature focused on the health co-benefits of urban climate change adaptation measures. Health co-benefits of seven different categories of adaptation measures are discussed. Results showed that existing evidence is mainly related to some categories such as critical infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and urban planning and design measures. Other adaptation categories like early warning systems; policy, management & governance, including local adaptation policies; and measures and strategies related to 'knowledge, perceptions & behavior' that mainly involve people's understanding and individual responses to climate change, are relatively underexplored. Moreover, it was discussed that some adaptation measures may result in health trade-offs and these needs to be further studied. Overall, through identifying health co-benefits, results of this review can make a strong case for further promotion of climate change adaptation in cities.

AB  - Purpose of review
   The aim of the review is to examine the findings of empirical studies of palliative care interventions for patients with heart failure in which a social worker was identified as a key member of the interprofessional clinical team.
   Recent findings
   Our systematic review of the empirical literature from January 2016 to August 2019 found five palliative care interventions with heart failure patients that cited involvement of a social worker as a key team member. The reviewed studies highlighted social workers' roles in the areas of psychosocial assessments and support, advance care planning, and patient-medical team communication.
   Summary
   Palliative social workers possess the knowledge and skills to provide expertise in psychological, social, and cultural care within palliative care domains of practice. Given this primary and critical role, more studies that include the assessment of outcomes linked to the social worker's role should be pursued. Our review unearthed several important studies that highlight the role of the palliative social workers in heart failure models of care.

AB  - Telecoupling is an integrative social-ecological framework that has made important contributions to understanding land change processes in a hyperconnected world. Visualizations are a powerful tool to communicate knowledge about telecoupling phenomena. However, little is known about current practices of telecoupling visualization and the challenges involved in visually displaying connections between multiple social ecological systems. Our research takes stock of existing telecoupling visualizations and provides recommendations for improving current practices. We systematically review 118 visualizations presented in the scientific literature on telecoupling, and assess them in terms of their content and the adopted visualization approaches. To this end, we conceptualize telecoupling visualizations through a network lens. We find that they typically present networks of social-ecological systems, which are linked through flows. Displays of telecoupling connections through actor networks or action situation networks are less frequent. We categorize the existing visualizations into seven main types, which differ in terms of the visual encoding strategies used to represent telecoupling components. We then draw on insights from data visualization literature to reflect critically upon these current practices and provide practical recommendations. Finally, we show that network perspectives are inherent in telecoupling research and visualizations, and may deserve further attention in this field.

AB  - Background: Walking is an essential activity for everyone and for older adults in particular, given that it is the most accessible form of physical activity and one of the healthiest transportation modes. Understanding how walkability (the potential of the environment to enable and/or encourage walking) has been objectively measured and analyzed for older adults is critical to create more inclusive, healthy, and sustainable environments and to promote healthy aging. Despite the numerous reviews on physical activity among older adults and its relationship with the built environment, the literature still lacks comparison reviews focusing specifically on objective operationalizations of walkability for older adults vs. the general population.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of 146 empirical studies that measured walkability objectively in relation to walking-related outcomes. We compared studies focused on older adults (n = 24) and the general population (n = 122). Content analysis included the characteristics of the study design, walkability measures, spatial extent, and associations found between walkability and walking-related outcomes.
   Results: In both groups of publications, the majority of studies were conducted in the US, Canada, and Europe, and largely in high-income countries. They were mostly published in health-related journals and used cross-sectional designs, operationalized walkability by using indexes, employed self-reported measures for walking-related outcomes, and found positive associations between walkability and walking outcomes. However, we observed some differences among studies focusing on older adults. Compared to studies focusing on the general population, a larger proportion of studies on older adults was conducted in the Middle East and Asia, and they used longitudinal designs, mixed methods to measure walking-related outcomes, variables related with land-use characteristics, safety from traffic and crime, and greenery, and a larger proportion found positive, as well as no associations between walkability and walking-related outcomes.
   Conclusion: Although there is a promising increase in interest in older adults-focused walkability studies in the last decade, there is still a need for more studies focusing on different settings, using wider spatial extents, longitudinal designs, objective or mixed methods to collect outcome data, and specific variables and/or specially created indexes for older adults and for settings.

AB  - DevOps is a set of practices and a cultural movement that aims to break down barriers between development and operation teams to improve collaboration and communication. Different organizations have embraced DevOps principles due to the massive potential, such as a much shorter time to production, increased reliability and stability. However, despite the widespread adoption of DevOps and its infrastructure, there is a lack of understanding and literature on the key concepts, practices, tools, and challenges associated with implementing DevOps strategies. The main goal of this research paper is to explore and discuss challenges related to DevOps culture and practices. Moreover, it describes how DevOps works in an organization, provides a detailed explanation of DevOps, and investigates the cultural challenges that organizations face when implementing DevOps. The proposed paper reveals ten critical challenges that need to be addressed in adopting the DevOps culture. The challenges are further analyzed on the basis of the various continents. According to the findings, the following critical challenges are considered during the implementation of a DevOps culture: lack of collaboration and communication, Lack of skill and knowledge, complicated infrastructure, Lack of management, Lack of DevOps approach, and trust confidence problems.

AB  - Tropical small islands are particularly vulnerable to environmental impacts. In the small islands of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), multiple stressors of environmental and socio-economic change interact and intensify at reduced spatial scales. Actors and institutions need to respond to these changes through responses - reactive or proactive actions planned or implemented by individuals, groups or organisations; aimed at responding to changing contexts and scenarios, by reducing, preventing and/or reverting the risks and impacts of environmental change. Through a mixed-method systematic review of academic literature from 2010 to 2020 using the Web of Science literature database, we document the types of responses, actors involved and elements of effective responses. We analysed 329 studies focusing on nine WIO small island states and territories (SISTs) - Zanzibar, Mafia, Seychelles, Comoros, Mayotte, La Re acute accent union, Mauritius, Maldives and Lakshadweep. Using quantitative content analysis, we organised information into categories ranging from institutional (economic instruments, laws, policies and community based), social (educational and informational), infrastructural (engineered and technological) and ecological restoration-based responses. The articles varied in their geographical distribution, focus and depth with regard to the responses studied. Diverse responses are documented, that often overlap across categories and may be combined and pursued simultaneously. For example, responses range from coastal protection structures, land reclamation, land elevation and artificial islands to mangrove restoration, awareness raising programs, coastal zone regulations and climate induced migration and relocation policies. Responses were predominantly institutional (85% of 329 articles, n = 281) - mainly driven by governments. The most common social responses (53%, n = 183) were linked to environmental education programs and knowledge sharing platforms. Although the responses indicated an increasing interest in ecological restoration (27%, n = 91) and community-based initiatives (36%, n = 120), they were largely underrepresented in research. Cataloguing the different responses may help incorporate the diversity into well-informed decisions, offer alternative ways of thinking and highlight specific areas and response types that should be the focus of future research and practice. The elements influencing the effectiveness of responses were identified through thematic synthesis - relevance to the local social-ecological context, resources available (time and funding), knowledge (access, diversity, integration, transfer, innovative and anticipatory), governance of responses (coordinated, transparent, adaptive, equitable, participatory and polycentric) and iterative monitoring. These elements of effectiveness tend to be synergistic and no single element is effective in isolation. When these elements are not considered, the response intervention could be maladaptive or counterproductive. Poorly designed responses result in perverse social and ecological outcomes, further increasing the exposure and vulnerability to the environmental stressors and decreasing public confidence and support. This review documents current literature, points to knowledge gaps and highlights the potential for islands to learn from each other and to further apply these lessons to non-island settings, critically considering the local context.

AB  - The anthropogenic release of chemicals from industry, agriculture and the breakdown of consumer wastes constitute a major threat to water resources and public health. Pollution is severe and increasing in the developing world where chemical substances are produced, used, and disposed of in an unregulated manner. The global public health consequences of chemical pollution are comparable to or greater than those of widespread infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. However, chemicals have so far been neglected by the WaSH sector. Here, we report the results of a systematic review of the Journal of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for Development (2011-2018) and oral/poster presentations given at the UNC Water & Health Conference (2010-2018). The review enumerated studies that focused on water quality and treatment from a chemical perspective, highlighting in particular organic contaminants of emerging concern. Organic chemicals were addressed in only 2% of journal articles and fewer than 0.7% of conference presentations. Geogenic contaminants arsenic and fluoride were only addressed in 2-3% of articles and presentations. The review concludes that a rapid, major effort to address toxic chemicals in WaSH is necessary to meet UN Sustainable Development Goals for universal access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030.

AB  - Entrepreneurial ventures that explicitly address social and environmental issues have proliferated, together with diverse but strictly connected research streams and academic discussions around the phenomena of social entrepreneurship and sustainable entrepreneurship. However, while existing literature reviews address either social or sustainable entrepreneurship, studies systematizing the convergences and divergences of both sustainable and social entrepreneurship simultaneously in the academic literature are lacking. To fill this gap, the authors performed a systematic literature review covering the Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2001 to 2022. A total of 209 articles were reviewed, and thematic and lexical data analyses were conducted. As a result, convergences and divergences related to enablers, impact, business models, financial constraints, and fundraising instruments were identified. This article concludes by providing insights about knowledge gaps associated with the role of entrepreneurs, networks, impact measurement, business model innovation, and the capital structure of social and sustainable ventures.

AB  - The comprehension of the businesses' impact to sustainable development requires consideration of the different factors that affect firms' behavior, such as corporate governance, non-financial regulation, and the external environment. The contribution of business and management scholars to the discussion surrounding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their impact for business organizations has grown exponentially in the last years. This review systematically examines, through bibliometric and systematic literature review methods, the scientific knowledge about SDGs and the business sector, analyzing (after fine-tuning) 266 articles published in leading journals between 2012 and 2019. The results reveal the existence of four research themes: technological innovation (cluster 1), firms' contributions in developing countries (cluster 2), non-financial reporting (cluster 3), and education for SDGs (cluster 4). The main insights from the analysis of the papers are discussed, future research directions and practical implications for the field of study are provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Schools have been identified as well placed to support students' wellbeing and encouraging the active participation of children and young people in school life is in line with current English legislation. Student-led research has the potential to create a positive, long-lasting impact. This evaluative systematic literature review (SLR) sought to identify the features of effective student participation in the co-production of whole-school wellbeing strategies, with a focus on Participatory Action Research (PAR) projects. Ten papers published between 2011 and 2021 were identified using the PRISMA framework and evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness of focus. Several factors were identified as impacting on the success of PAR, including group composition, power balance, and sustainability. The paper concludes that carefully planned PAR projects can result in successful collaboration with students to develop whole-school strategies for a range of issues/topic areas. Further research evaluating the long-term impact of such projects on whole-school practice is warranted.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is increasingly seen as a promising approach to feed the growing world population under climate change. The review explored how institutional perspectives are reflected in the CSA literature. In total, 137 publications were analyzed using institutional analysis framework, of which 55.5% make specific reference to institutional dimensions. While the CSA concept encompasses three pillars (productivity, adaptation, and mitigation), the literature has hardly addressed them in an integrated way. The development status of study sites also seems to influence which pillars are promoted. Mitigation was predominantly addressed in high-income countries, while productivity and adaptation were priorities for middle and low-income countries. Interest in institutional aspects has been gradual in the CSA literature. It has largely focused on knowledge infrastructure, market structure, and hard institutional aspects. There has been less attention to understand whether investments in physical infrastructure and actors' interaction, or how historical, political, and social context may influence the uptake of CSA options. Rethinking the approach to promoting CSA technologies by integrating technology packages and institutional enabling factors can provide potential opportunities for effective scaling of CSA options.

AB  - Self-collection concepts, such as collection and delivery points and parcel lockers, have been commonly deployed. These concepts rely on consumers' efforts to carry out Last-Mile Delivery (LMD) tasks and consequently relieve both operators' financial and sustainability pressures. Since the success of these self-collection operations involves both the operators' planning perspectives and consumers' participation, it is essential to jointly consider both aspects. However, existing research has largely overlooked the required synergies between the underlying consumer research and operations management studies. This paper aims to provide a review of related literature and subsequently propose a dual-perspective framework that bridges the gap. Specifically, systematic reviews on LMD self-collection consumer research and operations management studies are first conducted. The review highlights the research-to-practice gap that exists in consumer research as well as the need for improved modelling of consumer behaviours in operational models. This study then argues that an integrated approach that encompasses both viewpoints is needed. It is an approach that proactively optimises consumer demands through operational decisions supported by the connection between consumer behaviours and operational characteristics. For successful implementations of the proposed approach, specific research topics and directions are explicitly discussed.

AB  - The escalated energy demand in conjunction with the global warming and environmental degradation has paved the path of transportation electrification. Electric Vehicles (EVs) need to recharge their batteries after travelling certain distance. Thus, large scale deployment of EVs calls for development of sustainable charging infrastructure. The placement of charging stations is a complex optimization problem involving a number of decision variables, objective functions, and constraints. Placement of charging station mimics a non-convex and non- combinatorial problem involving both transport and distribution network. The complex and non-linear nature of the charging station placement problem has compelled researchers to apply Nature Inspired Optimization (NIO) algorithms for solving the problem. This study aims to review the NIO algorithms applied for solving the charging station placement problem. This work will endow the research community with a systematic review of NIO algorithms for solving charging station placement problem thereby revealing the key features, advantages, and disadvantages of each of these algorithms. Thus, this work will help the researchers in selecting suitable algorithm for solving the charging station placement problem and will serve as a guide for developing efficient algorithms to solve the charging station placement problem.

AB  - Metaverse is the next disruptive technology that will impact society in the coming decades, by enabling immersive experiences in both virtual and physical environments. Although still conceptual, Metaverse converges the physical and digital universe, allowing users to seamlessly traverse between them. Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse. Although still experimental, Metaverse is expected to revolutionize travel and tourism management and marketing. It empowers destination awareness, positioning and branding, as well as coordination and management, through digital twins. Metaverse provides opportunities to support trip planning, interaction and engagement, effectively transforming consumer behaviour. Visiting and engaging with destinations virtually is expected to motivate real travel, rather than replace it. This paper provides a vision of how Metaverse can revolutionize tourism experiences and transform tourism management and marketing. Drawing on a systematic review of scholarly works, articles from media and industry reports, this study defines and conceptualizes the Metaverse ecosystem for tourism and travel. It explores the foundations of the disruptions that Metaverse brings to tourism destinations and organisations and identifies the building blocks of Metaverse tourism. The study outlines research directions so that the tourism industry can take full advantage of the Metaverse capabilities and opportunities emerging as well as identify challenges for the future.

AB  - Sustainable urban water management (SUWM) requires an integrated, adaptive, coordinated and participatory approach. Current urban water policies are beginning to reflect this understanding yet the rhetoric is often not translated to implementation. Despite the 'new' philosophy, urban water management remains a complex and fragmented area relying on traditional, technical, linear management approaches. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the barriers to change, there has been little systematic review of what constitutes the scope of such barriers and how these should be addressed to advance SUWM. To better understand why implementation fails to occur beyond ad hoc project interventions, an extensive literature review of observed and studied barriers was conducted. Drawing on local, national and international literature from the field of integrated urban water management and other similar fields, 53 studies were assessed, resulting in a typology of 12 barrier types. The analysis revealed the barriers are largely socio-institutional rather than technical, reflecting issues related to community, resources, responsibility, knowledge, vision, commitment and coordination. Furthermore, the meta-analysis demonstrated a paucity of targeted strategies for overcoming the stated institutional barriers. Evaluation of the typology in relation to capacity building suggests that these systemic issues require a sophisticated programme of change that focuses on fostering social capital, intersectoral professional development, and inter-organisational coordination.

AB  - Place identity studies have attracted considerable interest in South Africa because of its history of separate racial development. However, there is a paucity of studies that have reviewed such studies in the country. This article, therefore, aims to present a selective review of place identity studies in post-apartheid South Africa. A literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Studies published in English between 1994 and 2020, relating to changing place identities as a result of apartheid in South Africa, were included in our search. The search yielded studies from which four key themes were identified - these being identity and belonging, social identity and discursive practice, cultural symbolism and group identity, and social inclusion and exclusion. These themes attest to the social construction of place identity, with people forming cognitive and affective bonds within groups. In addition, these themes show that mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are crucial for identity formation in which the self is contrasted with 'the other'. The studies collectively point to the intricacies surrounding attempts at desegregation and building social cohesion in post-apartheid South Africa.

AB  - In recent years, there have been international movements advocating more sustainable societies, and as a result of such movements, a remarkably important sub-branch has been shaped in systems studies called sustainability. It would be vital to propose methods that could deal with inherent complexities and uncertainties in such systems. Grey systems theory (GST) represents a nascent method that could help to solve complexities in the face of multifaceted problems, uncertainty, and complexity in systems, and the theory could considerably contribute to sustainability studies. The present study sought to fill a gap and provide an updated review of the literature on the roles and impacts of GST-based methods in sustainability studies as one of the most significant areas of exploring economic, social and environmental systems. Primarily, the theoretical foundations of sustainability and GST were briefly reviewed. Next, by categorizing the studies conducted in the literature on sustainability studies, GST-based methods used in such studies were identified. Finally, the advantages, effects and functions of GST-based theories and their applications in sustainability studies were explicated. The papers found in this systematic review were searched on such databases as Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, as published from 2010 up to the first three months of 2020, based on these keywords: grey relation or grey relational, grey model, grey system or grey systems, grey prediction, grey control, grey incidence, grey cluster, grey decision, grey input-output. The total number of publications found on all of the databases was 446, although (following a more meticulous investigation of the publications) 145 ones were used for the comprehensive analysis. The 10 different areas in which GST was used to explore sustainability in the publications were: sustainability assessment, industrial sustainability, urban sustainability, energy sustainability, sustainability development, businesses sustainability, agricultural sustainability, sustainable products, tourism sustainability, social sustainability. The results revealed that complexity, uncertainty, and inaccessibility of a large set of data and initial statistical distributions led researchers to rely on GST in sustainability studies, and that the applied areas of GST in terms of sustainability issues had some features in common, including linguistic variables, long-term projects, technological demands, conflicting goals, and uncertainty. Moreover, compared to other methods used to deal with uncertainty, GST did not require the formation of an extensive databank of classified rules and was more practical and efficient in sustainability calculations (as complex systems) with fewer numerical calculations. Ignoring systematic approaches, causal relations, cause-effect loops, and dynamic feedback was the missing link in the application of GST in sustainability studies as complex economic, social and environmental systems.

AB  - Background Extensively managed grasslands in temperate biomes are capable of harboring a big variety of plant and invertebrate species. Yet, they have suffered from a strong decline in the past decades mainly due to agricultural intensification. Agri-environment schemes have been introduced in Europe in order to promote farmland biodiversity, but they were only little effective, especially so in grasslands. Not surprisingly, grassland restoration and recreation through active seed addition has thus gained in importance in the recent years. The most common methods used rely either on the addition of commercial seed mixes, on the addition of seeds collected from a speciose donor grassland or on transferring hay from a speciose donor grassland after the soil of the receiver site has been prepared (ploughing, harrowing or topsoil removal). While there is evidence that these restoration methods may contribute to improve the biodiversity of grasslands, especially plant diversity, their relative effectiveness remains poorly known. The aim of this systematic review is to scrutinize the peer-reviewed literature for scientific evidence about comparative effectiveness. Methods We will search for peer-reviewed journal articles in bibliographic databases and grey literature in search engines and organizational websites dealing with at least one of the above mentioned seed addition methods. We will only include studies which were carried out in temperate Europe. Through a scoping exercise a search string was developed which was based on a previously prepared test-list. The search string was then tested for validity with two independent reference lists. Screening will be done on the title, abstract and full-text level and consistency checking will be done on a random subsample by a second reviewer. After critically appraising internal validity of the retained studies, data on the responses of plants and invertebrates as well as all relevant meta-data will be extracted and coded. A meta-analysis will be conducted on studies with high internal validity whereas a narrative analysis will be done with descriptive statistics on studies with medium internal validity. Potential effect modifiers like study duration, former land use or local climate will be included in the analysis as moderators.

AB  - Historically, the Olympic Games have had a tremendous impact on the economy, tourism industry and social and political aspects of a hosting nation. The Olympic Games are the most globally promoted and commercialised sporting event in the world. This fact has led global firms to mandate significant changes in many aspects of traditional Olympics advertising relating to media content, media channel/placement and the overall budget allocation pattern. In pursuit of desired outcomes, sponsorship-linked promotion and marketing that primarily focuses on communication objectives allows both sport authorities and corporate sponsors to reach a considerable number of markets across the world. The aim of this paper was to explore the content characteristics of commercial partners who participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games on the basis of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental sustainability (ES). The intention is not to merely verify the marketing communication strategies of commercial partners, but to review historical and theoretical perspectives through a systematic review of the Olympic Partners. This facilitates our understanding of why there have been certain historical changes in their marketing communication strategies with regard to CSR and ES. Implications for mega-event managers and future research are also outlined.

AB  - Despite its popularity in urban studies, the smart city (SC) concept has not focused sufficient attention on citizens' quality of life (QoL) until relatively recently. The aim of this study is, therefore, to examine the concept of QoL in SCs using a systematic review of 38 recent articles from 2020-2022. This includes definitions and concepts, indicators and domains that are used to measure QoL, and the typical research methods that are used to collect data. The review analyses some of the main themes that emerge from the field of SCQoL which include smart urban governance, sustainability, smart living, participation, and social inclusion. The findings from this SC and QoL research can help city planners to prioritize which domains are the most important or meaningful for citizens and which services to invest in. It has been suggested that smart living is the most important domain of a SC. However, various studies have found that citizens experience SC initiatives holistically and that QoL is quite dependent on context in terms of priorities. Therefore, citizen participation strategies should be tailored and adapted to each respective context. SC governance also needs to be more long-term and strategic with real evidence that citizens are involved in decision making and problem solving and are not just passive recipients.

AB  - Tilapia culture is a very promising industry within the aquaculture sector. However, disease outbreaks have continued to threaten the industry, causing serious economic losses among the producers. Streptococcosis has become the major bacterial disease affecting tilapia production in most regions of the world. To combat the disease and minimize its economic impact on fish producers, numerous preventive and control measures have been developed and reported over the years. This paper aims to systematically review the measures that could be used to manage the disease outbreaks and maintain fish health based on previously published scientific studies. Although numerous measures currently available have been highlighted, it is far better for the producers to maximize the preventive measures for management to be economically feasible. Among the currently available preventive measures, the use of vaccines has been shown to have the most promise, while the use of herbs has been demonstrated to be a more sustainable and economically affordable control measure. However, there are still a number of important gaps in existing literature that require further investigation. Overall, significant progress has been made in preventing and controlling streptococcosis in tilapia although, no single effective measure has been identified. Therefore, a combination of these measures may provide a more effective result.

AB  - Achieving sustainable food and nutrition security calls for multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms in implementing, among others, nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. Despite progresses made in evaluating the effectiveness/impact of these interventions in some countries, very little is known about the nature and causal effect of these interventions in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review aims to provide evidence on the impact of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions and pathways linking agriculture to improved nutrition. Based on a comprehensive advanced literature search using keywords in various databases and setting inclusion/screening criteria, we identify 25 relevant studies conducted between 2008 and 2018. Overall, we find positive effects on knowledge, attitude, and practice of complementary feeding and economic indicators (income, poverty and asset accumulation). We also find an overwhelming positive effect on food consumption, dietary diversity, and food security indicators. However, we also note mixed effectiveness in relation to child anthropometry. The most important pathways linking agriculture to improved nutrition center on its role as a source of food and income, and its effect on food prices/market. Hence, enhancing community-based nutrition education, accelerating adoption of improved technologies, improving access to farm inputs and technical information, integrating farmers to markets, and boosting enabling environments and capacities should be emboldened.

AB  - This article presents results of a systematic review of the conceptual and empirical literature published in the area of environmentally sustainable freight transportation (ESFT) since 1990. The research has been largely atheoretical and descriptive, though that has begun to change with the dramatic growth in this literature since 2010. The literature to date provides interesting insights into the way that ESFT practice has evolved. Following an input-transformation-output model, the topical focus of the research began with an emphasis on transformation processes or activities, and then considered inputs (represented by drivers/facilitators), barriers as moderators of the process, and outcomes of practice, or outputs. This article provides extensive suggestions for future research in each of the topical areas to help fill some of the gaps in theory and to enhance practice.

AB  - Solid waste management (SWM) has recently received more attention, especially in developing countries, for smart and sustainable development. SWM system encompasses various interconnected processes which contain numerous complex operations. Recently, deep learning (DL) has attained momentum in providing alternative computational techniques to determine the solution of various SWM problems. Researchers have focused on this domain; therefore, significant research has been published, especially in the last decade. The literature shows that no study evaluates the potential of DL to solve the various SWM problems. The study performs a systematic literature review (SLR) which has complied 40 studies published between 2019 and 2021 in reputed journals and conferences. The selected research studies have implemented the various DL models and analyzed the application of DL in different SWM areas, namely waste identification and segregation and prediction of waste generation. The study has defined the systematic review protocol that comprises various criteria and a quality assessment process to select the research studies for review. The review demonstrates the comprehensive analysis of different DL models and techniques implemented in SWM. It also highlights the application domains and compares the reported performance of selected studies. Based on the reviewed work, it can be concluded that DL exhibits the plausible performance to detect and classify the different types of waste. The study also explains the deep convolutional neural network with the computational requirement and determine the research gaps with future recommendations.

AB  - Today's agriculture faces many concerns in maintaining crop yield while adapting to climate change and transitioning to more sustainable cultivation practices. The application of plant biostimulants (PBs) is one of the methods that step forward to address these challenges. The advantages of PBs have been reported numerous times. Yet, there is a general lack of quantitative assessment of the overall impact of PBs on crop production. Here we report a comprehensive meta-analysis on biostimulants (focus on non-microbial PBs) of over one thousand pairs of open-field data in a total of 180 qualified studies worldwide. Yield gains in open-field cultivation upon biostimulant application were compared across different parameters: biostimulant category, application method, crop species, climate condition, and soil property. The overall results showed that (1) the add-on yield benefit among all biostimulant categories is on average 17.9% and reached the highest potential via soil treatment; (2) biostimulant applied in arid climates and vegetable cultivation had the highest impact on crop yield; and (3) biostimulants were more efficient in low soil organic matter content, non-neutral, saline, nutrient-insufficient, and sandy soils. This systematic review provides general biostimulant application guidelines and gives consultants and growers insights into achieving an optimal benefit from biostimulant application.

AB  - Agricultural management practices have impacts not only on crops and livestock, but also on soil, water, wildlife, and ecosystem services. Agricultural research provides evidence about these impacts, but it is unclear how this evidence should be used to make decisions. Two methods are widely used in decision making: evidence synthesis and decision analysis. However, a system of evidence-based decision making that integrates these two methods has not yet been established. Moreover, the standard methods of evidence synthesis have a narrow focus (e.g., the effects of onemanagement practice), but the standard methods of decision analysis have a wide focus (e.g., the comparative effectiveness of multiple management practices). Thus, there is a mismatch between the outputs from evidence synthesis and the inputs that are needed for decision analysis. We show how evidence for a wide range of agricultural practices can be reviewed and summarized simultaneously ("subject-wide evidence synthesis"), and how this evidence can be assessed by experts and used for decision making ("multiple-criteria decision analysis"). We show how these methods could be used by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in California to select the best management practices for multiple ecosystem services in Mediterranean-type farmland and rangeland, based on a subject-wide evidence synthesis that was published by Conservation Evidence (www.conservationevidence.com). This method of "evidence-based decision analysis" could be used at different scales, from the local scale (farmers deciding which practices to adopt) to the national or international scale (policy makers deciding which practices to support through agricultural subsidies or other payments for ecosystem services). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method, and we suggest some general principles for improving evidence synthesis as the basis for multi-criteria decision analysis.

AB  - Land to people interaction is an old phenomenon that has occurred throughout human history. The scope and nature of the relationship has been changing over time as a result of continuous and disruptive socio-cultural and technological changes. Human civilizations observed in the past as well as the current rapid technological advancements and high rate of urbanization, along with the need for sustainable development are driving for changes in land to people interactions. However, studies and scientific discourses on examining the changing people-land relationships and the co-evolving need to manage or govern land are scarce. This paper, therefore, aimed to offer an understanding on how the concept of land administration evolved from the complexities involved in the changing people to land relationships. To achieve the objective of the paper, desk review research approach was employed. The review demonstrates that various forms, designa-tions, functions of land administration have been evolved over the history of human being as a response to manage the changing people to land relationships. Thus, it is plausible to assume that the notion of land administration is deeply founded in human history and is one of the oldest professions that support humanity. Finally, this study underlines that land administration as a subject or concept is constantly evolving due to the changing nature of people's perception to-wards land and it is also expected to continue to co-evolve and respond to address societal needs at a particular time.

AB  - Many pilot-based initiatives have been developed to promote awareness and use of climate information services among vulnerable smallholder farmers in Africa through milliondollar investments. However, despite their experimental nature, these pilot projects have been successful in raising participating farmers' awareness and use of climate information services and they can inform transferrable good practices. Through a systematic literature review approach, this review sought to understand ways in which these past pilot projects have contributed to climate risk management in the context of smallholder farming and the factors that led to their success. Results showed that climate information services' main contribution to climate risk management has been through facilitating farm level decision making. Factors that led to success of the pilots include: use of downscaled information; building institutional partnerships to add value to climate information; involving farmers through the co-designing and co-developing process; face-to-face communication; embedding pre-seasonal workshops in the activities of local institutions for sustainability; and using diversity of communication channels to enhance reach among others. These factors can be borrowed as good practices to inform future effort s f ocused on increasing adoption of climate information services among a wider population, beyond the reach of specific pilot projects.

AB  - Every year, logging in the world's largest tropical forest, located within the Amazon biome, continues unabated. Although it is a preferred alternative to deforestation, the residual stand and site are impacted by logging. The objective of this review was to determine and assess the current state of research throughout Amazonia on the subject of logging impacts. To achieve this goal, a systematic approach was utilized to gather, assess and categorize research articles conducted in the Amazon biome over the last decade. Eligibility for inclusion of articles required demonstration of a direct impact from logging operations. A total of 121 articles were determined to meet the eligibility requirements and were included in this review. Articles were subdivided into three environmental categories: forest (n = 85), wildlife (n = 24) and streams (n = 12). The results of this review demonstrated that impacts from logging activities to the forest site were a direct result of the logging cycle (e.g., how often logging occurs) or logging intensity (e.g., how many trees are felled). The impacts to wildlife varied dependent on species, whereas impacts to streams were affected more by the logging system. Overall, research suggested that to attain sustainability and diminish the impacts from logging, a lower logging intensity of 10-15 m(3) ha(-1) and a longer logging cycle of 40-60 years would be essential for the long-term viability of forest management in Amazonia.

AB  - This study investigates the main aspects of the quality of service (QoS) assessment process at airport passenger terminals to find gaps, highlight trends, and discuss current day challenges. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in Scopus and ISI Web of Science databases. Excluding redundancies, the searches resulted in an initial set of 565 articles. After preliminary steps, 61 of these studies were selected for in depth analysis. The research findings and discussions are organized into subsections focused on: (1) places of application (countries/regions); (2) airport areas; (3) evaluators profile; (4) methods; and (5) evaluation criteria. The main gaps revealed are the lack of: (a) applied studies in underdeveloped or developing countries; (b) specific studies for important airport areas, such as those related to access; (c) studies using assessments from arriving and transfer passengers, as well as from travel professionals and experts; and (d) full noncompensatory multicriteria sorting methods. In terms of trends, there is a clear advance in the use of data mining and sentiment analysis, evidencing the challenge for airport managers in dealing with the sources of online information as a management tool. Finally, the challenge of including in assessment process new criteria related to sustainability and COVID-19 era aspects is also noteworthy.

AB  - The present research aims to conduct a systemic review on Renewable Energy, Economic Growth and Economic Development and look for links between the papers published between 2008 and May 2021. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, it was possible to reach a sample of 111 articles selected by Web of Science and a sample of 199 academic articles selected by Scopus in that specific period. The analysis of the group of Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Consumption, Economic Growth and Economic Development shows that most of the articles published in this subsample use the quantitative methodology in economic sciences. The results indicate that research on the subject has a growing trend and that most of the articles are post-2015 publications. In addition, China has been the leading nation in published works. The journal Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews is considered the most relevant in this category, and Sustainability has the most publications. Finally, a research gap was identified to be explored, lacking studies aimed at understanding the consumption of renewable energies and economic development and studies that focus on renewable energies and economic growth in less developed economies.

AB  - This paper documents an exercise to synthesize and assess the best available scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of different farm practices at enhancing natural pest regulation in agriculture. It demonstrates a novel combination of three approaches to evidence synthesis-systematic literature search, collated synopsis and evidence assessment using an expert panel. These approaches follow a logical sequence moving from a large volume of disparate evidence to a simple, easily understandable answer for use in policy or practice. The example of natural pest regulation in agriculture was selected as a case study within two independent science-policy interface projects, one European and one British. A third funder, a private business, supported the final stage to translate the synthesized findings into a useful, simplified output for agronomists. As a whole, the case study showcases how a network of scientific knowledge holders and knowledge users can work together to improve the use of science in policy and practice. The process identified five practices with good evidence of a benefit to natural pest regulation, with the most beneficial being 'Combine trap and repellent crops in a push-pull system'. It highlights knowledge gaps, or potential research priorities, by showing practices considered important by stakeholders for which there is not enough evidence to make an assessment of effects on natural pest regulation, including 'Alter the timing of pesticide application.' Finally, the process identifies several important practices where the volume of evidence of effects on natural pest regulation was too large (> 300 experimental studies) to be summarised with the resources available, and for which focused systematic reviews may be the best approach. These very well studied practices include 'Reduce tillage' and 'Plant more than one crop per field'.

AB  - The mining sector generates a considerable amount of waste stone and tailings, which constitute a rrsubstantial hazard to the ecology. The most prevalent method of disposing of these industrial rrwastes is by dumping, which adds to soil deterioration and water contamination and also takes up rrvaluable land. Fortunately, it can be recycled in a variety of ways, including the promising rrgeopolymerisation technique, which converts waste into value. This article discusses recent rradvances in the production of mine tailings-based geopolymers composites (MT-GPC) from waste and rrindustrial by-products as a potentially sustainable construction material. Besides, focusing on the rrfollowing rraspects: economic and production perspective; environmental consequences and waste rrdisposal; physical and chemical properties; mechanical properties; durability properties; rrmicrostructure propertiesr; thermal properties; and potential applications of MT-GPC.r

AB  - Mixed conifer forests of western North America are challenging for fire management, as historical fire regimes were highly variable in severity, timing, and spatial extent. Complex fire histories combined with site factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great variation in understory plant communities, and management activities influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities. This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density) commonly declined in the short term within 4 years after treatment. This may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire, heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5 years since treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory understory relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000 stems ha(-1) and 80 m(2) ha(-1) basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30-50% cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed conifer forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the age of big data, case studies build the foundation for the large-scale models that are increasingly being used for decision and policymaking. In this systematic literature review, we investigated the geographic, methodological, and conceptual characteristics of case studies in climate change science to evaluate the extent they provide policy recommendations to answer the questions: how can researchers best gather and report policy-relevant information for climate change adaptation, resilience, and/or recovery? What are the current themes within the literature, and how can these areas best advance as policy-relevant fields within climate change science? Findings highlight that policy recommendations were more robust, and significantly more likely, in case studies that employ participatory research methods; and geographic characteristics and use of theoretical frameworks are associated with providing policy recommendations. On the other hand, studies that focus on biophysical parameters of climate change offered weak or no policy recommendations.Thus, we conclude that local-level case study research can serve as validation and calibration data for large-scale models as long as they accurately represent the local values and perceptions of the people in the study area. We elaborate on the opportunities that exist in non-human, biophysical, research for communicating findings to policy-friendly audiences.

AB  - ObjectivesMeta-analyses are considered generally as the highest level of evidence, but concerns have been voiced about their massive, low-quality production. This paper aimed to evaluate the landscape of meta-analyses in the field of occupational and environmental health and medicine.MethodsUsing relevant search terms, all meta-analyses were searched for, but those published in 2015 were assessed for their origin, whether they included randomised trials and individual-level data and whether they had authors from the industry or consultancy firms.ResultsPubMed searches (last update February 2017) identified 1251 eligible meta-analyses in this field. There was a rapid increase over time (n=16 published in 1995 vs n=163 published in 2015). Of the 163 eligible meta-analyses published in 2015, 49 were from China, followed at a distance by the USA (n=19). Only 16 considered randomised (intervention) trials and 13 included individual-level data. Only 1 of the 150 meta-analyses had industry authors and none had consultancy firm authors. As an example of conflicting findings, 12 overlapping meta-analyses addressed mobile phones and brain cancer risk and they differed substantially in number of studies included, eligibility criteria and conclusions.ConclusionsThere has been a major increase in the publication of meta-analyses in occupational and environmental health over time, with the majority of these studies focusing on observational data, while a commendable fraction used individual-level data. Authorship is still limited largely to academic and non-profit authors. With massive production of meta-analyses, redundancy needs to be anticipated and efforts should be made to safeguard quality and protect from bias.

AB  - The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was established by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 to promote comparative effectiveness research (CER) to assist patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policy-makers in making informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence concerning the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and managed through research and evidence synthesis.
   The development of PCORI is vested in the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The framework of CER and PCORI describes multiple elements which are vested in all 3 regulations including stakeholder involvement, public participation, and open transparent decision-making process. Overall, PCORI is much more elaborate with significant involvement of stakeholders, transparency, public participation, and open decision-making. However, there are multiple issues concerning the operation of such agencies in the United States including the predecessor of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR), AHRQ Effectiveness Health Care programs, and others.
   The CER in the United States may be described at cross-roads or at the beginnings of a scientific era of CER and evidence-based medicine (EBM). However the United States suffers as other countries, including the United Kingdom with its National Health Services (NHS) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), with major misunderstandings of methodology, an inordinate focus on methodological assessment, lack of understanding of the study design (placebo versus active control), lack of involvement of clinicians, and misinterpretation of the evidence which continues to be disseminated.
   Consequently, PCORI and CER have been described as government-driven solutions without following the principles of EBM with an extensive focus on costs rather than quality. It also has been stated that the central planning which has been described for PCORI and CER, a term devised to be acceptable, will be used by third party payors to override the physician's best medical judgement and patient's best interest. Further, stakeholders in PCORI are not scientists, are not balanced, and will set an agenda with an ultimate problem of comparative effectiveness and PCORI that it is not based on medical science, but rather on political science and not even under congressional authority, leading to unprecedented negative changes to health care. Thus, PCORI is operating in an ad hoc manner that is incompatible with the principles of evidence-based practice.
   This manuscript describes the framework of PCORI, and the role of CER and its impact on interventional pain management.

AB  - Sharing of resources, goods, services, experiences and knowledge is one of the fundamental practices that has been widely embedded in human nature. With the advance of information and communication technology, the realm of sharing has expanded drastically, which has led to the evolution of the sharing paradigm'. In spite of the increasing attention on the new sharing phenomenon and its potential contribution to a sustainable and resilient society, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of varied sharing practices in the context of sustainability and resilience. This study maps out the academic landscape of sharing studies and examines what and how we share by a systematic literature review. Based on the review of 297 peer-reviewed papers, we explore the features of varied sharing practices identified in academia. We also discuss research gaps in sharing paradigm studies and the potential contribution of sharing to building sustainable and resilient societies. Our results show regional and sectoral imbalances in the sharing studies. The findings also illustrate that sharing ofmanufactured goods and accommodations, and access-based sharing with monetary compensation via intermediaries such as online platforms are predominant. Our evaluation provides a bird's-eye view of existing sharing studies and practices, enabling the discovery of new opportunities for sustainable and resilient societies.

AB  - IntroductionAlthough progress has been made over the past 30 years to decrease neonatal mortality rates, reductions have been uneven. Globally, the highest neonatal mortality rates are concentrated in countries chronically affected by conflict. Essential newborn care (ENC), which comprises critical therapeutic interventions for every newborn, such as thermal care, initiation of breathing, feeding support, and infection prevention, is an important strategy to decrease neonatal mortality in humanitarian settings. We sought to understand the barriers to and facilitators of ENC delivery in conflict settings. MethodsWe systematically searched Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases using terms related to conflict, newborns, and health care delivery. We also reviewed grey literature from the Healthy Newborn Network and several international non-governmental organization databases. We included original research on conflict-affected populations that primarily focused on ENC delivery. Study characteristics were extracted and descriptively analyzed, and quality assessments were performed. ResultsA total of 1,533 abstracts were screened, and ten publications met the criteria for final full-text review. Several barriers emerged from the reviewed studies and were subdivided by barrier level: patient, staff, facility, and humanitarian setting. Patients faced obstacles related to transportation, cost, and access, and mothers had poor knowledge of newborn danger signs. There were difficulties related to training and retaining staff. Facilities lacked supplies, protocols, and data collection strategies. ConclusionsStrategies for improved ENC implementation include maternal and provider education and increasing facility readiness through upgrades in infrastructure, guidelines, and health information systems. Community-based approaches may also play a vital role in strengthening ENC.

AB  - Changes in land use appear as one of the direct drivers of global environmental change. Consequently, international recommendations indicate the need to integrate protected natural areas into land-use planning policies to favor the conservation of nature, its cultural values and ecosystem services in the long term. This is possible by understanding that nature conservation is a complex issue that crosses and is crossed by numerous territorial issues such as economy, politics and culture. However, the articulation between protected areas and land use planning policies is still a generalized challenge. In this article we expose to what extent and in what way the international scientific community has responded to the need for knowledge on this subject, focusing, particularly, on the social approach of these processes. This perspective is relevant insofar as it allows identifying values, social behaviors and political factors for an effective coordination that favors the mitigation of the socio-ecological crisis from "bottom up". To this end, the results of a systematic review of international and, particularly, Latin American literature, indexed in the Scopus database for the last 20 years, are presented, complemented with a search in Scielo and other academic bibliography available on the subject in the region. Three main approaches were identified in the literature, with a prevalence of a technical vision of the articulation of protected areas in land use planning, oriented to the measurement and prediction of impacts and priority areas, rather than the analysis of political and social variables. A research agenda is proposed.

AB  - Scientific research provides essential information for conservation of threatened species. Data deficiency due to insufficient research impedes the design of conservation plans, and research bias may mistakenly direct limited resources to low biodiversity regions or less threatened species. Here, we conducted a systematic review of published papers, grants, and graduate student training on carnivorans in China to identify species bias and research gaps. Furthermore, we collected intrinsic and extrinsic features of carnivorans, and identified features that impact research intensity using generalized linear models. We found that the amount of research on carnivorans increased markedly after 2000, but species bias existed. Bears and big cats received the greatest research attention, while most small- and medium-sized carnivorans received little attention, thus showing the 80-20 phenomenon. Species with a higher level of endemism and protection under Chinese law received more consideration. As an animal conservation icon in China, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) attracted more than 50% of overall carnivoran research resources. However, the giant panda also showed spillover effects, i.e., post-doctoral graduates who studied the giant panda shifted their research focus to other species after graduation, which may help improve research on other species. Thus, to improve and strengthen Carnivora research and conservation, we suggest investing greater effort in species of less concern, training of more graduate students, and reinforcing academic exchange. If such actions are not taken, many carnivoran species will continue being data deficient and threatened.

AB  - Recurring controversies involving supply chain-related sustainability incidents suggest that firms with a global presence struggle to improve environmental, social and economic outcomes in global supply chains. Sustainable supply chain management has been suggested for improving sustainability outcomes in supply chains, yet global supply chains pose unique challenges. This paper aims to provide a synthesis of the key elements of sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains. To achieve this goal, we conduct a rigorous systematic literature review of articles focused on sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and apply structured content analysis to * mentioned articles spanning 15 years of research published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals. The research contributes by identifying configurations and governance mechanisms as key elements characterizing sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and synthesizing their relationship with sustainability outcomes. Overall configurations characterized by a greater connection between the focal firm and multi-tier suppliers, managed directly or through third parties, are increasing trends suggested to better serve sustainability development and offer several areas for future research. The research also contributes to practice by providing managers of focal firms with global supply chains directions for improving sustainable outcomes in their supply chains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite their importance to ecosystem services, wetlands are threatened by pollution and development. Over the last few decades, a growing number of wetland studies employed remote sensing (RS) to scientifically monitor the status of wetlands and support their sustainability. Considering the rapid evolution of wetland studies and significant progress that has been made in the field, this paper constitutes an overview of studies utilizing RS methods in wetland monitoring. It investigates publications from 1990 up to the middle of 2022, providing a systematic survey on RS data type, machine learning (ML) tools, publication details (e.g., authors, affiliations, citations, and publications date), case studies, accuracy metrics, and other parameters of interest for RS-based wetland studies by covering 344 papers. The RS data and ML combination is deemed helpful for wetland monitoring and multi-proxy studies, and it may open up new perspectives for research studies. In a rapidly changing wetlands landscape, integrating multiple RS data types and ML algorithms is an opportunity to advance science support for management decisions. This paper provides insight into the selection of suitable ML and RS data types for the detailed monitoring of wetland-associated systems. The synthesized findings of this paper are essential to determining best practices for environmental management, restoration, and conservation of wetlands. This meta-analysis establishes avenues for future research and outlines a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art ML tools for processing RS data. Overall, the present work recommends that wetland sustainability requires a special land-use policy and relevant protocols, regulation, and/or legislation.

AB  - In the last decades, a growing scholarship has outlined the crucial role of social networks as a source of resilience. However, with regard to the Global South, the role of social networks for the resilience of rural communities remains an under-researched and underconceptualized issue, because research remains scattered between different strands and has rarely been integrated from a resilience perspective. To provide common ground for the exchange between disciplines and to identify steps towards a more comprehensive social network perspective on the resilience of rural communities in the Global South, we present a systematic review of contemporary case studies from three strands of research: (i) natural resource management, (ii) agricultural innovation, and (iii) social support. Although studies in each strand have their own particular strengths and weaknesses in addressing aspects of the resilience of rural communities in the Global South, they all share a static view of the outcomes of social networks, tend to emphasize structure over agency, and neglect spatial dimensions of social relations. To address these challenges, we propose a translocal social network perspective on resilience that views rural communities as being embedded in social networks that connect people and facilitate the flow of resources, information, and knowledge between places.

AB  - Pacific Island Countries (PICs) lag behind global trends in water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) development. We conducted a systematic search of all English language papers (published before February 2015) about WaSH in PICs to evaluate the state of the peer-reviewed literature and explore thematic findings. A total of 121 papers met the criteria for full-text review following an initial search result of more than 6,000 papers. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality and relevance of each article and consolidated their findings according to four emergent themes: public health, environment, emergency response and interventions, and management and governance. Findings indicate a knowledge gap in evidence-guided WaSH management strategies that advocate for human health while concurrently protecting and preserving drinking water resources. Extreme weather events threaten the quantity and quality of limited freshwater resources, and cultural factors that are unique to PICs present challenges to hygiene and sanitation. This review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the peer-reviewed literature on WaSH in PICs, addresses spatial and temporal publication trends, and suggests areas in need of further research to help PICs meet development goals.

AB  - The institutional setting within which consumption and production occurs has profound influence on preferences and forms of production, and substantially shapes resource throughput of economies, pollution and land use. Institutional economics is arguably the most important subdiscipline of economics in enabling an inter-disciplinary and systems approach to ensure sustainable economy solutions. The purpose and academic contribution of the paper is to conduct the first systematic review of existing institutional economics frameworks that can be applied to explore sustainable development. The scientific value added of the review is to draw out, cluster, compare and contrast: the focus, contribution, use and institutional approaches of studies, as well as sector applicability, aims of sustainable development addressed and key gaps. Results show that most frameworks can be classed as applying new institutional economics approaches (or similar) and focus on common property or social ecological systems. Most of these frameworks see institutions as rules and often have a strong focus on formal rules. Another key finding is that most frameworks address the environmental aim of sustainable development, but few address all three aims. There was also found to be a lack of frameworks with a foreground focus on the end consumer and downstream supply chains that drive resources use and environmental impact. Classical institutional economics is largely neglected by most frameworks, yet classical institutional economics can inform the cultural shift to more sustainable economies, because of its focus on a wider range of informal institutions.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Multiple agricultural water management (AWM) technologies are being promoted worldwide in rainfed agro-ecological production systems, such as the Limpopo River Basin, to close the yield gap, enhance food security and reduce poverty, but evidences on yield gains and environmental impacts are varied. This paper conducts a review of the performance of AWM technologies against conventional farmer practices to produce adequate evidence on cereal yield and field runoff changes. With the interrogation of literature from 1980 to 2013 using seven AWM groupings, enough evidence was found that AWM technologies can deliver substantial benefits of increased crop yield and water productivity with reduced environmental impacts. Using random effects model, the standardized mean difference (SMD) of yield between AWM and control was 0.27, while SMD of water productivity was 0.46, indicating the effectiveness of the technologies (SMD>0). Subgroup analyses showed greatest yield responses on silty-clay-loam, clay-loam and sandy soils compared to clay and loam-sandy soils, and higher yield increase under low rainfall regime (200-500 mm) than under high rainfall regime (500-800 mm). Large yield change variations for different AWM technologies present a huge opportunity for meeting the existing yield gaps and enhancing coping capacity in dry years and under climate change.

AB  - The preconception period is a key public health and clinical opportunity for obesity prevention. This paper describes the development of international preconception priorities to guide research and translation activities for maternal obesity prevention and improve clinical pregnancy outcomes. Stakeholders of international standing in preconception and pregnancy health formed the multidisciplinary Health in Preconception, Pregnancy, and Postpartum (HiPPP) Global Alliance. The Alliance undertook a priority setting process including three rounds of priority ranking and facilitated group discussion using Modified Delphi and Nominal Group Techniques to determine key research areas. Initial priority areas were based on a systematic review of international and national clinical practice guidelines, World Health Organization recommendations on preconception and pregnancy care, and consumer and expert input from HiPPP members. Five preconception research priorities and four overarching principles were identified. The priorities were: healthy diet and nutrition; weight management; physical activity; planned pregnancy; and physical, mental and psychosocial health.

These priorities provide a road map to progress research and translation activities in preconception health with future efforts required to advance evidence-translation and implementation to impact clinical outcomes.

AB  - The use of Battery Electric Vehicles is one of the biggest transformations in the field of sustainable development, holding the potential to address many sustainability challenges. Despite their high energy efficiency, the utilisation of these vehicles remains largely underexplored due to several factors. One of the prominent factors is the phenomenon of range anxiety (RA). This review aims to provide an overview of the range anxiety phenomenon, identifying its primary influencing variables and strategies for mitigating it. The review places particular emphasis on the method-ologies and tools employed for assessing range anxiety and related factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and APA PsycInfo, using the following keywords: "range" AND ("stress" OR "anxiety") AND ALL ("electric" AND "vehicle"). The protocol was registered with OSF, registration number is https://doi.org/10. 17605/OSF.IO/FN4VW. The articles were selected by two independent authors. The methodo-logical quality and risk of bias were assessed.A total of 17 studies were included in the systematic review. Studies were analysed by sample size, conceptual framework, assessment method and results. The findings highlight that an approach grounded in Human-Factors principles and psychological metrics can significantly contribute to addressing range anxiety. More, individual (level of experience, self-efficacy, threatening perceptions, attitude, technology commitment and personality) and interface fea-tures (range estimation, State of Charge, adaptability, GPS, charging points map, road informa-tion) have a role in influencing the EV usage and the onset of RA. Among the commonly employed methods for assessing range anxiety were questionnaires (PASA), scenario-based analyses, and behavioral observations (including facial expression and gaze analysis). This review shows that the best solution to reduce the range anxiety may be to design im-provements that minimize alterations to lifestyle and behaviour in comparison to the traditional vehicle.The most effective approach for mitigating range anxiety might involve designing improve-ments that minimise disruptions to lifestyle and behaviours when compared to traditional vehi-cles. As a novel contribution, this research presents a diagram illustrating the significant relationships between range anxiety and individual, socio-technical, and Human-Factors variables.

AB  - The Nordic countries' agricultural sector is potentially considered both a winner and loser in relation to climate change. With effective adaptation management, climate change could lead to increased agricultural productivity. Yet if concurrent challenges are left unaddressed, productivity losses may impede gains. Thus, adaptation to climate change is key both to avoid negative consequences and to benefit from opportunities. This paper conducts the first systematic literature review of scientific and grey literature on climate change related opportunities and challenges in Nordic agriculture, resulting in a complex overview of required adaptation actions. The synthesis on suggested adaptation policies and measures shows that farm based adaptation measures appear to be more abundant and more discussed than policy driven adaptation in the scientific literature. This paper identifies a knowledge gap regarding the complexity of adaptation needs and trade-offs in the Nordic agricultural sector. In conclusion, although the agricultural sector in the Nordic region is facing certain benefits from climate change, this review demonstrates profound challenges related directly to climate change. The synthesis of suggested adaptation actions furthermore indicates that adaptation involve trade-offs, however, increased knowledge on this subject is required. Failing to address these challenges might impede Nordic agriculture's potential gains from climate change in a long-term perspective.

AB  - The present article, classified as theoretical-conceptual applied, of descriptive nature, aims to mapping and analyze, through scientometry, the international scientific production that addresses the integration between public policies for family agriculture production and food and nutrition security in the period from January 1990 until the present day. Therefore, a portfolio survey was carried out through the search system of the Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct databases, comprising the terms "Food and Nutrition Security", "Public Policy" and "Family Agricult*", combined in pairs, following the Methodi Ordinatio research methodology. Then, a systematic analysis was performed to identify the behavior of the publications related to the theme over these almost 30 years. To explore the issue, we analyzed nine variables of interest. It was noticed that the subject is of interest to several areas of study, besides a global concern, and the studies developed in Brazil are highlighted in the international scenario. This study contributes as a justification for the integration between public policies of food and nutrition security and family agriculture production to be strengthened, both in the formulation of government strategies, as well as in social and academic research, by applying a systematic preparation process of a scientific portfolio.

AB  - For decades, nations around the world have been promoting irrigation expansion as a method for improving agricultural growth, smoothing production risk, and alleviating rural poverty. Despite its apparent advantages, suboptimal adoption rates persist. According to the existing literature, determinants of irrigation adoption are often highly dependent on cultural, contextual, and/or local institutional factors. Yet, studies from diverse geographies identify a consistent set of factors. Thus, to be able to make generalizable inferences from such studies, a global geographic representativeness assessment of irrigation adoption studies was conducted to determine whether identified factors influencing irrigation were the result of geographic, epistemological, or disciplinary biases. The results indicate that multiple geographic biases exist with respect to studying farmers' irrigation adoption decision-making. More research on this topic is being conducted in regions that have little to a high percentage of irrigation (>1%), are readily accessible, receive moderate amounts of average annual rainfall, and have moderate amounts of cropland cover. The results suggest the need to expand research efforts in areas with little to no irrigation to identify constraints and help accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction, and food and livelihood security for rural communities in these regions.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of environmental risks, the growing pressures from stakeholders and the development of ESG standards have prompted companies to embrace an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment. In such a scenario, technological change and innovation are pivotal enablers to improve how companies monitor their ESG data for disclosure purposes, and significantly enhance their strategic ESG per-formance in several ways, such as by reducing emissions and environmental impact. The adoption of digital solutions for ESG performance has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners, leading to a significant increase in scientific production in the past few years. Yet, extant literature appears fragmented and scattered, despite the fast pace at which it is developing. Consequently, the present study conducts a systematic review of 89 distinct contributions ranging from 2017 to 2023, in order to acquire pertinent information regarding the current status of the topic and draw several lines for future research. The review identifies three main thematic areas, namely the use of digital technologies to enhance the transparency and reliability of ESG data tracking and reporting, the peculiarities of strategic ESG performance when it comes to high-tech companies, and the direct effects technological change has on ESG performance. The study provides a critical overview of each of the thematic areas mentioned above, along with a structured research agenda, thus contributing to the theoretical and managerial discussion on ESG performance and technological change.

AB  - The conventional component repair in remanufacturing involves human decision making that is influenced by several factors such as conditions of incoming cores, modes of failure, severity of damage, features and geometric complexities of cores and types of reparation required. Repair can be enhanced through automation using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Advancements in AM have led to the development of directed energy deposition and laser cladding technology for repair of damaged parts and components. The objective of this systematic literature review is to ascertain how intelligent systems can be integrated into AM-based repair, through artificial intelligence (AI) approaches capable of supporting the nature and process of decision making during repair. The integration of intelligent systems in AM repair is expected to enhance resource utilization and repair efficiency during remanufacturing. Based on a systematic literature review of articles published during 2005-2021, the study analyses the activities of conventional repair in remanufacturing, trends in the applications of AM for repair using the current state-of-the-art technology and how AI has been deployed to facilitate repair. The study concludes with suggestions on research areas and opportunities that will further enhance the automation of component repair during remanufacturing using intelligent AM systems.

AB  - Recent innovations in business models and technology have brought out new mobility systems, including shared and electric micromobility. A rapidly expanding strand of literature mirrors the micromobility's exponential growth and popularity. While many studies analyze micro-mobility from operations, management and user perspectives, fewer works investigate the micro-mobility and built environment (BE) relationship. This paper systematically reviews the descriptive and empirical studies that investigate this relationship. It analyzes whether, similar to other transportation modes, micro-mobility (e.g., bike-sharing schemes and e-bikes/e-scooters) can potentially influence three BE aspects: urban design, land use, and transportation system. Furthermore, it outlines the recommended changes in the BE to support the micro-mobility and/or enhance the quality of the environment for non-users. This paper investigates the BE and micro-mobility relation at the three levels of node (e.g., the emergence of docking stations and parking stops), link (e.g., the street-level conflicts with walking/cycling/ vehicle lanes) and network (e.g., infrastructure network creation and catchment area shifts). In addition, this relation is explored over time, based on the development stage of micro-mobility, the BE aspect (urban design, land use, or transport system), and spatial context (urban or rural). The findings are relevant for urban and transport planners, designers, researchers, policy makers and public authorities. They contribute to a much-needed evidence base for effective design and policy recommendations to accommodate micro-mobility in the BE to achieve a safe and inclusive public space.

AB  - Agri-food systems (AFS) have been central in the debate on sustainable development. Despite this growing interest in AFS, comprehensive analyses of the scholarly literature are hard to find. Therefore, the present systematic review delineated the contours of this growing research strand and analyzed how it relates to sustainability. A search performed on the Web of Science in January 2020 yielded 1389 documents, and 1289 were selected and underwent bibliometric and topical analyses. The topical analysis was informed by the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) approach of FAO and structured along four dimensions viz. environment, economy, society and culture, and policy and governance. The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS. It makes the case for adopting a holistic, 4-P (planet, people, profit, policy) approach in agri-food system studies.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify the main Green Technology practices carried out in the countries Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), through a systematic review without temporal delimitation. BRICS countries were chosen due to the high potential for impact on the environment, as well as the possibility of increasing the theoretical subsidy in discussions related to sustainable practices in these countries. The Methodi Ordinatio methodology was used to select and map the portfolio of relevant articles in the area, which allowed the identification of the main Green Technology practices used in the BRICS countries. The final portfolio was composed of 170 studies. The main Green Technology practices used in the BRICS are related to products, processes, and raw materials; a sustainable agriculture; water treatment and retention; waste management; green energy and energy reduction; carbon and biogas reduction; green buildings; and sustainability and ecocities policies. A greater number of researches on Green Technology and its practices took place in the countries of China and India, which can be explained due to its more sustainable development, greater number of sustainable actions, and growing interest by the country's local academy. Brazil, Russia, and South Africa did not excel in Green Technology practices. The study provided an overview of the practices used in these countries and that can contribute to guidance for companies that are concerned with sustainability. It is worth mentioning that the political interest in this topic was identified, because there are political actions that encourage Green Technology practices.

AB  - In today's globalized world, possessing an intercultural communicative competence is important. For this reason, technology-assisted intercultural learning programs are widely implemented in all academic levels. However, most scholars reviewed studies on intercultural learning that were carried out in language learning context. We argue that there are many other learning contexts in which intercultural learning was integrated but they were neglected in related review studies. For example, intercultural learning was integrated in business, healthcare or tourism because it is important for students who study in these learning contexts to be interculturally competent and have abilities to smoothly interact and collaborate with colleagues, partners or customers from different cultural backgrounds in the future. Another example is when interculturally competent teachers can teach students from multicultural perspectives and respond to their needs based on appreciation for otherness and cultural difference. To address the existing gap in the field, we reviewed research on technology-assisted intercultural learning implementation in various learning contexts. We particularly focused on the following dimensions: (1) research focus; (2) theoretical foundation; (3) technologies; (4) learning contexts; (5) countries, languages and participants; (6) learning activity; (7) data collection; and (8) findings. Twenty-eight research articles were reviewed and the results were reported and discussed in the paper. The results of this study can be useful for educators and researchers who plan to integrate intercultural learning in various learning contexts.

AB  - This paper conducts a structured review on the topic of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in the supply chain management context to define research trends on the topic and identify research gaps. The review is carried out using the largest databases of peer-reviewed literature (Scopus and Web of Science). A sample of 122 papers focusing on the topic of energy-efficient and sustainable supply chain management was selected and analyzed through descriptive and content analysis. The review highlights that despite there is a growing research trend on the topic, different research gaps remain to be covered. These gaps concern the factors influencing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives, the classification of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives, the impact of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability on supply chain performance, the customer perspective in sustainable and energy-efficient supply chain, and the different technologies supporting the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability initiatives. The research gaps and the research questions identified offer the opportunity to identify areas of investigation to design future research directions and propose guidelines in the field of supply chain management.

T2  - TRANSYLVANIAN REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA  - English
KW  - REFLECTIONS
KW  - GOVERNMENT
AB  - A general trend is easily observable in the literature on public administration reforms in post-communist countries and it consists in analyses of the degree of adoption and success of the New Public Management (NPM) model. Relevant implementation gaps for some levels as well as areas of reform, which cannot be ascribed to the NPM in these countries, are highlighted. The combination of these two features also common, and not by accident, to other Continental European countries may well be read as the adoption of a modernization framework different from the NPM, which some authors have come to recognize as the New Weberianism.
   Nonetheless, both models are not sufficiently developed and analyzed to provide a framework for evaluating country experiences. Therefore, the paper will firstly perform a systematic review of the literature on the context and cultural dependency of public management reforms, the debate on the NPM and the New Weberianism, with the aim of defining an analytical theoretical framework suitable for the analysis and comparison of country experiences; secondly, undertake an in-depth evaluation of public management reform trends in two countries Albania and Romania and contrast these with OECD countries' experience.
   Public administrations of some European countries, including Albania and Romania, are not NPM "laggards" but have instead chosen to adopt a different modernization model: i.e. the New Weberianism. Implications for future research and policy-makers are drawn.

AB  - Tourism has the potential to trigger lifelong changes through a transformative experience. However, existing tourists' transformative experience (TE) research has been criticized for lacking the embodied dimensions of transformative experiences leading to fragmented and contradictory views on what and where these experiences take place in the tourism context. Considering these criticisms coupled with the important role of transformative experience, this study systematically examines tourists' transformative experience literature to address the current knowledge gap. Adopting a quantitative systematic literature review approach, this paper aims to outline the research trends of tourists' transformative experiences and provide insights for future research. The findings suggest that more research concerning transformative experiences in tourism has been dedicated to volunteer tourism discourses as the context of volunteering offers a 'once in a lifetime' experience. The findings also point to a dearth of appropriate and comprehensive theoretical frameworks in the tourism context. The current study found that while transformative experiences are reflected in four dimensions of behavioral, psychological, social, and spiritual experiences; socio-psychological transformation experiences dominate. A research framework with future research questions unpacking possible theoretical and methodological directions is further proposed.

AB  - Objective
   In addition to the many social, economic, cultural, security, and environmental problems in the metropolitan areas, suburbanization has led to the growth and spread of domestic violence against women, and is still increasing. Different social determinants can play a role in violence against suburban women, so this study was designed to investigate the social determinants of domestic violence in suburban women of developing countries.
   Methods
   According to PRISMA guideline, the keywords, which were determined considering MESH, were searched in Google Scholar, MEDLINE, SID, Web of Science, Pubmed, Scopus and Science Direct with the 2009 to 2019 time limit. STROBE checklist was used for evaluating quantitative studies and JBI for qualitative studies. Finally 30 high quality studies were included.
   Results
   The prevalence of general domestic violence among women of different ages was reported between 2.3-73.78% in the suburban regions of developing countries. The prevalence of physical, emotional and psychological violence was about 11.54-61.6% and 7.8-84.3%. The prevalence of sexual,economic and the verbal violence was about 0.8-58.8%, 13.7- 43.7% and 33.21-86.1%. The most common factors affecting violence against women were the structural factors of early marriage, the husband's addiction to alcohol and drugs.
   Conclusion
   General domestic violence and its various types are prevalent in different parts of the world and the factors affecting domestic violence such as age, marriage age, low literacy, husband addiction to alcohol and drugs are all things that can be prevented by special health planning in these areas to improve women's health and thus prevent violence against suburban women.

AB  - Efficient energy supply is a means for people to gain access to a wide range of energy-related services. In unmet energy markets where energy supply is inadequate or lacking, such services, and the resulting benefits, are seldom attained. This has prompted research on energy transition, specifically a transition to renewable energy, to rapidly diffuse energy access in these regions. Existing energy transition frameworks are predominantly contextualised in developed economies, with little evidence of their applicability in the context of developing countries. This paper proposed an energy transition framework for the unmet electricity markets, after conducting a systematic review of the literature on energy transitions, specifically relating to sustainable transitions of electricity systems. Contextual limitations observed in the energy transition literature included market demand, scale of energy infrastructure, type of energy resource, transition duration, novelty of opportunities, and level of external influence. An energy transition framework for unmet electricity markets was subsequently conceptualised. The key characteristics of this modified transition framework are: (i) traditional technology; (ii) defunct deceleration; (iii) a niche technology curve; (iv) landscape support for niches; and (v) new regime condensation (emergence). Contextual awareness in designing policy frameworks for energy transition is essential to achieve sustainable energy for all, particularly in unmet electricity markets.

AB  - The sharing economy (SE) has gained attention in recent years in both academia and practice. This derives from the economic and social benefits that are often attributed to it, but also from its limited anticipated environmental impacts. However, its role as a sustainability enabler will largely depend on the extent to which consumers change the criteria they consider. If consumers engage in sharing motivated by the same drivers as usual, rebound effects can significantly reduce the sustainability potential of the SE. This paper contributes to this debate by illuminating on the existing SE literature and consumer behavior. The research team systematically scrutinized 175 scientific papers through a novel approach that combines bibliometric, epistemological and substantive meta-analysis. 3,191 influential construct-item combinations were collected from the sample and categorised according to a comprehensive typology. The findings highlight the diversity of drivers/barriers studied so far regarding the SE, as well as the limited attention paid to environmental factors. Despite this, environmental factors are often found to significantly influence the willingness to share, particularly in sectors such as mobility, clothing and household goods. Results demonstrate that environmental factors have been analysed at a broad level and almost exclusively as potential motivations (rebounds never being considered).

AB  - Objective: The main objective of this study was to summarize the Hybrid War's core characteristics and humanitarian and medical impacts. Method: A Systematic Literature Review according to PRISMA guidelines, using the following keywords, 'Hybrid War,' 'Humanitarian Law,' 'Human Rights,' 'Lawfare,' and search engines PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Gothenburg University's database to collect literature from 2000 to 2022 in English was conducted. The eligibility of qualified articles was assessed, an inductive qualitative thematic analysis was applied, and the scientific evidence of each selected piece was evaluated. Results: The objectives of a Hybrid War are to achieve the tactical and strategic goals in a battle rather than to save civilian lives. It involves networks of state and non-state actors with various means of military and militia influences and strategies, creating difficulties in implementing, controlling, and evaluating the International Humanitarian Law's "A State responsibility" principle, to gain insight into an armed conflict. It targets populated civilian areas and raises ethical and moral concerns by using Lawfare. Conclusions: Hybrid War's multi-domain action should be met with multi-dimensional approaches and a doctrine of 'acceptable losses.' Its characteristics and consequences should be learned and taught. Several measures need to be implemented to counteract its impacts, and a flexible surge capacity should be designed, planned, and executed.

AB  - Following the systematic review and bibliometric analysis of current literature, this paper attempts to investigate whether the wealth generated through cryptocurrency trading can assist in attaining the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goal (SDG) 7, affordable and clean energy and UN SDG 13 related to climate action. The critical analysis of literature indicates a growing interest in cryptocurrency, the UN's SDGs and the negative effect that crypto mining has on the use of enormous energy. However, there is a clear gap in the literature that focuses on the possibility of using the wealth generated through cryptocurrency trading in financing environmentally friendly projects and attaining the UN's SDG 7 and SDG 13. The findings and the future research direction of this study aim to firstly expand the academic literature related to SDG 7 and SDG 13 and secondly to examine the relationship between cryptocurrency and sustainability even during an uncertain period. This study provides evidence pertaining to the theoretical models that can be applied within discussion of the complex relationship between cryptocurrency, clean energy and climate action. Our findings will provide policymakers with information regarding actions that need to be taken in order to convert cryptocurrency generated wealth and consequently attaining sustainable socio-economic goals in the future.

AB  - Critical metals are technologically vital to the functionality of various emerging technologies, yet they have a potentially unstable supply. This condition calls for strategic planning based on the expected long-term demand and supply of these metals and the implications attached. Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles. All of these findings affirm the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Conventional fossil-fuel energy resources are being drastically depleted; thus, the current shift towards renewable energy (RE) resources has become imperative. However, there are many impediments to the adoption of renewable power generation. These impediments can be overcome by enacting policies to encourage the acceptance of sustainable energy resources. For instance, the net-metering policy can provide the necessary incentives to promote the development of local distributed energy sources, primarily solar photovoltaic and wind generators. While there has been significant advancement and development in net-metering in Asia with the increased penetration of RE, at present there is a lack of systematic review in this area. This paper aims to present an in-depth review on net-metering advances and challenges, current RE shares, and future RE targets in the Asian region. Additionally, a case study is performed and an economic analysis of net-metering regulations in an Asian country is carried out. In this study, the monetary benefits of net-metering policies for residential consumers are proved. It is envisaged that the information gathered in this paper will be a valuable one-stop source of information for Asian researchers working on this topic.

AB  - IntroductionThe purpose of emergency medical services (EMS) is to preserve life and limb in emergency situations. Palliative care, however, is not concerned with 'life-saving' measures, but the prevention and relief of suffering. While these care goals appear to conflict, EMS and palliative care may be complementary if integrated. The aim of this scoping review is to map existing literature concerning EMS and palliative care by identifying literature types, extracting key findings and noting limitations using descriptive analysis.Methods and analysisThe framework of Arksey and O'Malley will direct this review. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO. In addition, the University of Cape Town Thesis Repository and Google Scholar will be searched for relevant grey literature. Empirical studies concerning EMS and palliative care published between January 2000 and September 2021 will be included. Article selection will be performed and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist. Extracted data from included articles will undergo descriptive analysis with findings being reported in a discussion format.Ethics and disseminationThis review will identify and describe existing literature concerning EMS and palliative care, highlighting key findings and knowledge gaps in the subject area. Findings will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders through peer-reviewed, open-access journal publication. As no participants will be involved and selected literature is publicly available, no ethical approval will be required.

AB  - For years the health systems of the world have maintained a complex organizational structure that responds to their health needs based on their internal characteristics. Currently, the pandemic put the health systems of the entire world to the test; Various interpersonal, community operational strategies - pre-hospital, hospital, isolation and quarantine were applied, and Ecuador was no exception, but despite this nothing is enough. To analyze the relationship between the management and response capacity of health systems, in times of COVID-19. A systematic review was carried out in the Scopus, Pub med and Google Academic databases under the terms: "Health systems", "COVID - 19", "response capacity", "health policies", "pandemic", at the global, regional and local levels. A critical analysis of the bibliography found was carried out, of a total of 30 articles that met the search and selection criteria, most of the articles mentioned the importance of Primary Health Care (PHC) applied at all levels under various approaches in addition to the use of novel and proactive technologies. The health systems were put to the test during the pandemic, each of them responded according to their management capacity and sustainability, it was evidenced that there is no method that allows to deal effectively with stochastic situations, so the only thing that What could be done was to shovel the various components of the pandemic, the interleaved mitigation and suppression methods are a promising element under novel modalities such as Tics.

AB  - Patients with nocturia are commonly referred to urology clinics, including many for whom a nonurological medical condition is responsible for their symptoms. The PLanning Appropriate Nocturia Evaluation and Treatment (PLANET) study was established to develop practical approaches to equip healthcare practitioners to deal with the diverse causes of nocturia, based on systematic reviews and expert consensus. Initial assessment and therapy need to consider the possibility of one or more medical conditions falling into the "SCREeN"areas of Sleep medicine (insomnia, periodic limb movements of sleep, parasomnias, and obstructive sleep apnoea), Cardiovascular (hypertension and congestive heart failure), Renal (chronic kidney disease), Endocrine (diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, pregnancy/menopause, and diabetes insipidus), and Neurology. Medical and medication causes of xerostomia should also be considered. Some key indicators for these conditions can be identified in urology clinics, working in partnership with the primary care provider. Therapy of the medical condition in some circumstances lessens the severity of nocturia. However, in many cases there is a conflict between the two, in which case the medical condition generally takes priority on safety grounds. It is important to provide patients with a realistic expectation of therapy and awareness of limitations of current therapeutic options for nocturia. Patient summary: Nocturia is the symptom of waking at night to pass urine. Commonly, this problem is referred to urology clinics. However, in some cases, the patient does not have a urological condition but actually a condition from a different speciality of medicine. This article describes how best the urologist and the primary care doctor can work

AB  - Continuous increase in the population of the world along with multiple nutrient deficiencies and poor water use efficiency offers a challenging scenario for agriculture sector to meet the increasing demand of food. Use of organic amendments like biochar and compost has been suggested as a novel approach for restoration of degraded soil further improving crop productivity and water productivity. Thus here, we have reviewed the publications on individual and combined application of biochar and compost to find out the potential role of these amendments in agriculture sector. We have concluded that (1) data on well-designed field studies and long-term effect of biochar and compost is limited; (2) traditional methods have been adopted for production of biochar and compost; and (3) biochar and compost have the potential to enhance soil fertility, crop production and water productivity with reduced environmental impacts. Furthermore, combined application of biochar and compost found to be more effective as compared to sole application of these amendments. This review article will play a dynamic role for scientists to conduct research to evaluate these ecological fertilizers best suited for soils, which will be helpful to reduce the chances of soil degradation caused by application of unsuitable amendments. Application of amendments not suitable for a soil may increase the demand of synthetic fertilizers thus making it uneconomical for farmers. Thus, it is suggested for the scientists and policy makers to make a great collaboration to implement this promising technology worldwide.

AB  - IntroductionCardiovascular disease (CVD) contribute the largest mortality burden globally, with most of the deaths (80% of all deaths) occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Tanzania. Despite the increasing burden, to date, CVD research output is still limited in Tanzania, as it is for many sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. This trend hinders the establishment of locally informed CVD management and policy changes. Here, we aim to review the existing gaps while highlighting the available opportunities for a sustainable CVD research strategy in Tanzania. MethodsA rapid review of available literature on CVD research in SSA was conducted, with emphasis on the contribution of Tanzania in the world literature of CVD. Through available literature, we identify strategic CVD research priorities in Tanzania and highlight challenges and opportunities for sustainable CVD research output. FindingsShortage of skilled researchers, inadequate research infrastructure, limited funding, and lack of organized research strategies at different levels (regional, country, and institutional) are among the existing key bottlenecks contributing to the low output of CVD research in Tanzania. There is generally strong global, regional and local political will to address the CVD epidemic. The establishment of the East African Centre of Excellence in Cardiovascular Sciences (EACoECVS) offers a unique opportunity for setting strategies and coordinating CVD research and training for Tanzania and the East African region. ConclusionThere is a light of hope for long-term sustainable CVD research output from Tanzania, taking advantage of the ongoing activities and plans for the evolving EACoECVS. The Tanzanian experience can be taken as a lesson for other SSA countries.

KW  - EXPLORATION
AB  - Although Sustainability accounting originated around the 1980s and has been actively developing in recent years, it is considered to be not fully explored. To help scientists better understand the conceptual essence of this term, a systematic review of the literature. The aim of the article is a bibliometric analysis of the concept of sustainability accounting to visualize the scientific landscape using bibliometric maps. Information retrieval for bibliometric analysis was conducted in two scientometric databases Scopus Elsevier and Web of Science Core Collection for the keyword "sustainability accounting" in the period between 2010-2020. Based on the information obtained and exported to the data file, the analysis of visualization and clustering of the study was performed and bibliographic maps were generated using the VOSviewer tool. Clustering is a statistical procedure that made it possible to break down a large array of information on the topic of sustainability accounting into multiply (clusters). According to the results of the analysis, 251 publications were received in Scopus and 252 in Web of Science, the vast majority of which are scientific articles. Our findings show that the number of articles published in this area during the analyzed period has increased significantly, which indicates the interest among scholars and the relevance of this issue. The constructed bibliometric maps, tables and graphs made it possible to visually identify the leading countries (United Kingdom, USA, Australia, Germany, Italy and Spain), scientists from which deal with this issue, the most productive journals (Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability (Switzerland), Sustainability Accounting Management And Policy Journal), as well as the main areas of research shortly (sustainability report, corporate social responsibility, sustainable development, disclosure).

AB  - Objective: Post-stroke depression is a depressive mood disorder that follows a cerebrovascular accident and is a burden on stroke patients. Its management is included in clinical practice guidelines focused on stroke, and the recommended treatment is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in conjunction with psychotherapy. Clinical practice guidelines are recommendations used to standardize best medical practice, but there is no current evaluation of guidelines containing post stroke depression recommendations. Thus, the objective is to appraise the selected guidelines manner of development and quality.Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review across three databases and a manual google search was performed to collect guidelines that included recommendations on the management of post-stroke depression. 1236 guidelines were screened, and 27 were considered for inclusion. Considered guidelines were manually reviewed by the authors, and ultimately, 7 met inclusion criteria. The appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation was used to evaluate these guidelines' recommendations around post-stroke depression.Results: Three guidelines met the threshold considered "High", with all of them having five or more quality domains eclipse the cutoff score of 70%. Across all guidelines, the highest scoring domains were "Scope and Purpose", "Clarity of Presentation", and "Editorial Independence" with scores of 76.98%, 73.81%, and 91.36% respectively. The lowest scoring domains were "Applicability", "Rigor of Development", and "Stakeholder Involvement" with respective scores of 58.73%, 54.02%, and 43.90%.Conclusions: The domains "Applicability", "Rigor of Development," and "Stakeholder Involvement" were the lowest scoring domains. These specific domains represent areas in which future guidelines could be more developed.

AB  - Increasing prevalence of endemic chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka is a major health problem since the 1990s. Despite numerous studies on CKDu, research groups have been unable to develop a comprehensive approach to mitigate the disorder, and thereby to identify research gaps. We conducted a systematic literature review of 119 publications on CKDu in Sri Lanka from Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, published until end September 2020. A higher CKDu prevalence in the working population of the North Central Province was reported with recent studies indicating patients from non-endemic regions as well. A majority were etiological studies that recorded conflicting and inconclusive evidence on CKDu etiology. Studies on clinico-pathological, diagnostic, biochemical, and molecular biological aspects of CKDu, studies analyzing CKDu symptom burden, anthropological, and behavioral impacts of CKDu, were reviewed as well. A dearth of research exists on nutritional, demographical, immunological, and microbial aspects of CKDu. The overview of the reviewed literature indicated the absence of a comprehensive plan of action to mitigate this situation. Hence, we propose the "One Health" approach with a systems dynamics model as a potential way forward to alleviate the CKDu epidemic in Sri Lanka. This enables the representation of multiple causative agents (and interactions thereof) among environmental, animal, and human systems, in concert with the "exposome" that provides the totality of exposure the individual has undergone since birth.

AB  - Smart Agroforestry (SAF) is believed to be one of the alternative solutions in implementing sustainable forest management to achieve the community welfare. SAF provides agricultural and silvicultural knowledge and practices that aims not only for recovering the environmental attributes but also for increasing farmers resilience. However, the benefits of agroforestry related to soil fertility in optimizing the land productivity and governing the community livelihood are often overlooked and have not been well discussed. This review aims to describe how smart agroforestry practices in various regions in Indonesia and several other countries have significantly contributed to maintaining soil fertility and increasing crop production while assuring profitable benefits for the community. This review paper focuses on discussing the role of SAF in sustaining soil fertility and community livelihood in tropical and non-tropical regions. The review article was based on a synoptic review approach to SAF and Soil Fertility-related relevant publications and nationwide experiences. The review compiled and analyzed information from national and international research papers in various online scientific journals, conference proceedings and relevant books, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic being discussed. The study utilized a qualitative approach and drew upon primary and secondary sources based on a systematic review. Agroforestry has a significant role in recycling soil nutrients from the materials in the surrounding environment. SAF influences soil fertility physically, chemically and biologically. SAF practices in both wet and dry lands can contribute significantly to the community's income. This review unveils the latent potential and the role of SAF in sustaining soil fertility that supports the community's livelihood and can serve as impetus for future research.

AB  - Due to the rapidly increasing ridership and the relatively enclosed underground space, the indoor air quality (IAQ) in underground subway stations (USSs) has attracted more public attention. The air pollutants in USSs, such as particulate matter (PM), CO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are hazardous to the health of passengers and staves. Firstly, this paper presents a systematic review on the characteristics and sources of air pollutants in USSs. According to the review work, the concentrations of PM, CO2, VOCs, bacteria and fungi in USSs are 1.1-13.2 times higher than the permissible concentration limits specified by WHO, ASHRAE and US EPA. The PM and VOCs are mainly derived from the internal and outdoor sources. CO2 concentrations are highly correlated with the passenger density and the ventilation rate while the exposure levels of bacteria and fungi depend on the thermal conditions and the settled dust. Then, the online monitoring, fault detection and prediction methods of IAQ are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are also discussed. In addition, the available control strategies for improving IAQ in USSs are reviewed, and these strategies are classified and compared from different viewpoints. Lastly, challenges of the IAQ management in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic and several suggestions for underground stations' IAQ management in the future are put forward. This paper is expected to provide a comprehensive guidance for further research and design of the effective prevention measures on air pollutants in USSs so as to achieve more sustainable and healthy underground environment.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a bibliometric analysis of publication trends on the themes of biomass and bioenergy worldwide. A wide range of studies have been performed in the field of the usage of biomass for energy production, in order to contribute to the green transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies. Over the past 20 years (from 2000 to 2019), approximately 10,000 articles have been published in the "Agricultural and Biological Sciences" field on this theme, covering all stages of production-from the harvesting of crops to the particular type of energy produced. Articles were obtained from the SCOPUS database and examined with a text mining tool in order to analyze publication trends over the last two decades. Publications per year in the bioenergy theme have grown from 91 in 2000 to 773 in 2019. In particular the analyses showed how environmental aspects have increased their importance (from 7.3% to 11.8%), along with studies related to crop conditions (from 10.4% to 18.6%). Regarding the use of energy produced, growing trends were recognized for the impact of biofuels (mentions moved from 0.14 times per article in 2000 to 0.38 in 2019) and biogases (from 0.14 to 0.42 mentions). Environmental objectives have guided the interest of researchers, encouraging studies on biomass sources and the optimal use of the energy produced. This analysis aims to describe the research evolution, providing an analysis that can be helpful to predict future scenarios and participation among stakeholders in the sector.

AB  - Shrimp aquaculture is under pressure to increase its production to meet the growing demand for food from a growing population. In the Philippines, aquaculture has experienced the shift from milkfish to prawn, with its attractive marketable price. This intensification has led to negative and positive impacts, which have raised a range of environmental and socioeconomic problems. This paper reviews the environmental and socioeconomic challenges that the shrimp aquaculture industry faces using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. We examine the gaps and the changes that are required to revitalize the industry. We examine and assess the impacts of shrimp culture on the environment, e.g., shrimp farm management, marine pollution, disease outbreaks, and the social, economic, and climate change impacts. The presence of viral diseases, such as White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), Monodon Baculovirus (MBV), Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV), Hepatopancreatic Parvovirus (HPV), and Yellow Head Virus (YHV), have caused approximate losses in the industry of 40,080 mt in 1997, and 51,000 mt in 2014. Recommended strategies and policy changes are considered for the improvement of shrimp aquaculture, including disease management, the adoption of good aquaculture practices, proper environmental monitoring, sustainable practices at the farm level, and priorities for cooperation among the concerned government agencies and local governments, as well as the involvement of state universities and colleges, for better management practices.

AB  - Social science studies view community wellbeing to be a cumulative construct of multiple dimensions which include social, economic, environmental, physical, political, health, education indicators and more. The study of community wellbeing is compounded by climate change as it increases the frequency of disasters affecting all dimensions of community wellbeing. It becomes crucial for communities to build community resilience and address the impact on community wellbeing in the context of Disaster Risk Reduction and sustainable development. This systematic literature aimed to understand how community wellbeing is affected by climate change. It analysed 23 papers from Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, to address three research questions: (i) how do climate change scholars understand community wellbeing, (ii) how community wellbeing is affected by specific climate change factors/conditions and the nature of impact, and (iii) how the impact on community wellbeing as a result of climate change is being addressed. The study found that climate change scholars hold mixed and multiple views or understanding of community wellbeing and climate change led to mental stress decreasing community wellbeing. The solutions to improve community wellbeing in the context of climate change suggests that adaptation should be the main policy instrument supplemented by mitigation strategies and recommends building a vibrant research culture in wellbeing and climate studies, among others. This review provides insights into the complex relationship between community wellbeing and climate change and identifies areas for future research and policy development.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are transitional environments between continental and marine aquatic systems. Globally, coastal lagoons are of great ecological and socioeconomic importance as providers of valuable ecosystem services. However, these fragile environments are subject to several human pressures, including pollution by microplastics (MPs). The aim of this review was to identify and summarize advances in MP pollution research in coastal la-goons across the world. We consider peer-reviewed publications on this topic published in English and Spanish between 2000 and April 21, 2022, available in Scopus and Google Scholar. We found 57 publications with data on MP abundances and their characteristics in 50 coastal lagoons from around the world, 58% of which have some environmental protection status. The number of publications on this type of pollution in lagoons has increased significantly since 2019. Methodological differences amongst studies of MPs in coastal lagoons were nevertheless a limiting factor for wide-ranging comparisons. Most studies (77%) were conducted in single environmental compartments, and integration was limited, hampering current understanding of MP dynamics in such lagoons. MPs were more abundant in lagoons with highly populated shores and watersheds, which support intensive human activities. On the contrary, lagoons in natural protected areas had lower abundances of MPs, mostly in sediments and organisms. Fiber/filament and fragment shapes, and polyethylene, polyester, and polypropylene polymers were predominant. MPs had accumulated in certain areas of coastal lagoons, or had been exported to the sea, depending on the influence of seasonal weather, hydrodynamics, anthropogenic pressures, and typology of MPs. It is advised that future research on MP pollution in coastal lagoons should focus on methodological aspects, assessment/monitoring of pollution itself, MP dynamics and impacts, and prevention measures as part of a sound environmental management.

AB  - Mountains are a critical source of water. Cryospheric and hydrological changes in combination with socio-economic development are threatening downstream water security triggering the need for effective adaptation responses. Here, we present a global systematic review (83 peer-reviewed articles) that assesses different water-related stressors and the adaptation responses to manage water stress in major glaciated mountain regions. Globally, agriculture (42%), tourism (12%), hydropower (8%) and health and safety (4%) are among the main sectors affected by hydrological and cryospheric changes . A broad set of adaptation measures has already been implemented in the world's mountain regions. We find that globally the most commonly used adaptation practices correspond to the improvement of water storage infrastructure (13%), green infrastructure (9.5%), agricultural practices (17%), water governance and policies (21%), disaster risk reduction (9.5%) and economic diversification (10%). Successful implementation of adaptation measures is limited by reduced stakeholder capacities, collaboration and financial resources, and policies and development. To overcome these limitations, funding for climate change adaptation and development programmes in mountains and trust-building measures such as shared stakeholder activities need to be strengthened. Local awareness raising of both, the adverse effects of climate change and potentially positive implications of specific adaptation measures can help to support successful adaptation.

AB  - The increasing incidence of forest and land degradation is affecting billions of people, and causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Realizing the importance of forest restoration in moderating those impacts, various global and regional forest restoration initiatives (including Bonn Challenge 2011 and UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) have been launched. But the gap between restoration commitments and their ground realities is becoming a huge challenge because of the limited knowledge on forest restoration approach as well as underlying socio-economic and ecological factors impacting the restoration undertaking. Moreover, few studies have comprehensively looked at institutional, socio-economic, and ecological aspects of forest restoration in a common framework. By employing a systematic review of the literature (n = 64), review of policies, plans and project reports (n = 58) and expert survey (n = 22), this study has navigated the rise and fall of Nepal's 65 years of forest restoration practices. Our study found that Nepal's forest restoration interventions from 1956 to the early 1980s got mixed results because of the limited integration of socio-economic and ecological concerns in restoration programs. However, forest restoration works after the mid-1980 s charted a more successful pathway because of (1) policies favouring decentralized decision making and local institutions; (2) devolution of rights and responsibilities; (3) firmed commitment for and adoption of multistakeholder partnership for the forest and landscape restoration; (4) recognition of multifunctionality of forest ecosystems; (5) accommodation of socio-economic and ecological concerns in restoration program; 6) adoption of multiple restoration approaches at multiple scales; and 7) capacity development and extension services. As institutional, socio-economic, and ecological factors are often been overlooked in forest and landscape restoration initiatives, the inferences we made and suggestions we provided can inform the policymakers and practitioners (of Nepal and other countries) in translating regional and global restoration commitments into action.

AB  - Understanding the state of research, and its effectiveness, in a predominantly Life Sciences sphere, requires an assessment of knowledge growth dynamics, and the associated scientific and bibliometric impacts. We aim to create and evaluate, in a systematic review process, a macro-structure of the science generated in lion research in South Africa (SA) from 1990 to 2018. First, we classified the evidence architecture of lion research data extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection. Then, we identified prominent features that the datasets reveal in terms of authorship and ownership, as defined by first author affiliation and geographical location. Fifteen sub-disciplines were identified to characterize the topics. From 2000 onwards, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary contributions started to emerge, catering for research problems defined at the interface of the academic-practitioner domains. These included social and economics components, and were aligned with conservation framings that seek to evaluate conservation within market-based vs. people-based approaches. Study areas were concentrated within SA (61.8%) and the remainder was either conducted in the rest of Africa (22.9%), or in various combinations of geographical focus. Author affiliation indicated that 63.1% of first authors had a South African affiliation. The rest of Africa was poorly represented at 2.4%. The majority (57.1%) of the first authors was male, but from 2014 to 2018, female researchers outnumbered males; however, male first authors continued to be cited more frequently. Furthermore, we provide a systemic analysis of the way in which research contributes to lion conservation. Overall, three voices dominate this area. Firstly, Mode 1 research has been driving research output in a "vicious circle," motivated by researchers' quest for accumulating academic rewards. Secondly, the citation impact shows a gender disparity against the recognition of female researchers. Lastly, a power imbalance against authors from the rest of Africa became apparent, whereby their role is mainly shaped toward being team contributors. This research shows that effective conservation requires appropriate knowledge to be generated, and this to be effectively translated into practical applications, while considering all perspectives in order to provide the opportunity for balanced contributions and influences. Imbalances such as the ones revealed above are likely to prevail more broadly.

AB  - Over the last decades, urban agriculture (UA) and controlled environmental agriculture (CEA) have been growing in many urban areas of the world to supply fresh food locally and to provide multiple benefits for the sustainable development of urban landscapes. Municipal policies and regulatory tools are increasingly employed to support UA/CEA and minimize practical challenges. However, especially in Europe, there is a lack of systematic reviews that evaluate the impacts of city-level food policies for UA/CEA and their effectiveness as perceived by local responsible actors. To address this gap, this study presents a qualitative overview of municipal policies that affect UA/CEA. We reviewed more than 83 policy documents and manuscripts and performed an online structured survey targeting key local managers or employees of UA and innovative CEA systems in four EU cities - Barcelona (Spain), Lyon (France), Trieste and Udine (Italy). We assessed policy tools, especially for three identified types of UA (allotment gardens, community gardens and closed spaces using CEA) by mainly focusing on public and private institutions and including aspects concerning land use planning, health and environmental policies. The findings demonstrate how the four cities' municipal governments specifically designed and combined a multiplicity of policy instruments to enable, regulate and acknowledge UA/CEA as part of the urban metabolism and landscape. The policy instruments were shaped by different local governance and institutional structures as well as by the local actors and community practitioners and their growing interest in UA/CEA.

AB  - Lepidoptera represents one of the most abundant and diverse insect groups globally, with more than 178,159 species described in more than 4000 genera. This paper discusses the economic importance of these insects in Cameroon. The work was built on a comprehensive review of 60 relevant published articles from 1955 to 2021. Results show a great diversity of insects of economic importance belonging to the order Lepidoptera, of which 51 are known at the species level, eleven at the genus level, and many others not yet identified. Their economic importance is somehow conflicting, with a mix of harmful and beneficial species. Some are threats to agricultural production as pests at various plant stages, the Fall Armyworm being one of the worst. Their impact on food security is well documented and led to the conclusion that lepidopterans are the most important group of agricultural pests to be studied and controlled for sustainable production under climate change. Meanwhile, beside the use of butterfly wings for craft and artwork, lepidopterans are also a group valued as an excellent marketable food source in Cameroon's humid forest regions. Larval stages are sold fresh, dried or parboiled in rural and urban markets. This review concludes that there is a need in the context of food security to deeply evaluate the diversity, geographical distribution and seasonality of lepidopterans and their economic importance, and to promote sustainable management of those with positive economic importance and better control of those with negative impacts.

AB  - This study explores the business model literature within nature tourism, focuses on its sustainability-related aspects, and adopts some of the results of the literature review by Reinhold et al. The research questions concern how scholars use and operationalize the business model concept in the context of nature tourism, and to what extent sustainability-related aspects are included and discussed. A literature review was conducted including a total of 18 scientific articles from various disciplines. The findings suggest that scientific literature about business models in nature tourism is very limited, both in relation to the number of articles and their content. With regard to the latter, the business model concept is sometimes adopted without any clear definition, sustainability-related aspectsespecially those relative to the environmental dimensionare scarcely discussed, the perspective adopted is usually static, and innovation for sustainability is only marginally included. This indicates a clear gap in the literature and a considerable potential for future studies.

AB  - The growing relevance of video games in the social landscape requires an in-depth evaluation of the bidirectional influences of these adjacent contexts, among which the educational and cultural contexts stand out. This permeability allows the study of the cultural aspects surrounding the production and use of video games as tools for cultural dissemination. Our research enunciates, recognises, analyses and evaluates the impact of these tools with the aim of being taken into consideration by the scientific community and the general population, who most frequently consume, use and socialise through video games around the world. Based on this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out using the Prisma 2020 Protocol, using the WOS and SCOPUS databases as documentary sources, and the selection of research articles that explore the cultural aspects of video games according to pre-established criteria. The final sample (N = 45) was subjected to a study that posed 12 research questions around which this work is structured. As a result, it is evident that video games have a direct impact on the transmission of culture. Patterns and agents of cultural representation, transmission and communication were identified, allowing researchers to evaluate the impact of video games on culture and to approach this object of study from an academic perspective, helping to open up other lines of research related to the influence of video games on the assimilation of culture, the learning of relevant issues related to it or the transmission of specific cultural elements.

AB  - This paper analyses the future orientation of flood risk management in Austria. Framed by a systematic review of risk reduction measures, we assess the extent to which Austrian policies are characteristic of an anticipatory, forward-looking flood management approach to cope with expected future stresses on the flood risk, such as climate change and land development. The analysis shows that risk reduction measures build on status quo assessments and do not explicitly consider future changes in the flood hazard or vulnerability. However, new design standards for extreme events, the proliferation of large-scale flood retention, tightened land development and building restrictions, and novel planning instruments indicate that Austrian policies are increasingly forward-looking to more effectively mitigate future increases in the flood risk. This temporal reorientation is a consequence of a wider policy shift from flood control to integrated flood risk management. Faced with the increasing spatial interplay of risk reduction measures (e.g. securing land for flood runoff and flood retention), our analysis shows that inter-sectoral cooperation between water management and spatial planning can support long-term flood management decisions and maintain the ability to adapt to changing future conditions.

AB  - Equilibrium models (EMs) are frequently employed to examine the potential impacts of economic, energy, and trade policies as well as form the foundation of most integrated assessment models. Despite their central role coupling economic and environmental systems, environmental scientists are largely unfamiliar with the structure and methodology underpinning EMs, which serves as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration and model improvement. In this study we systematically extract data from 10 years of published EMs with a focus on how these models have been extended beyond their economic origins to encompass environmentally relevant sectors of interest. The results indicate that there is far greater spatial coverage of high income countries compared to low income countries, with notable gaps in Central America, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. We also find a high degree of aggregation within production inputs and sectoral outputs, particularly within the context of global socioeconomic scenarios. For example, we were unable to identify a single temporally dynamic study that distinguished between products arising from managed versus natural forest, or pastures relative to natural grasslands. Due to the necessary breadth and associated knowledge gaps within a model of the entire global economy, we see considerable potential for cross-disciplinary innovation as natural scientists gain familiarity into the role these models play in bridging the nexus between socioeconomic systems and environmental change.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse extant literature on POE of a building's operations and performance as a means of holistically mapping the existing body of knowledge (BOK); identify impediments preventing its wide-scale adoption throughout practice; and develop new theory that seeks to integrate digital technologies (such as building information modelling (BIM)) within facilities management (FM) via a POE feedback mechanism.
   Design/methodology/approach - An inductive and interpretivist methodological approach is adopted that utilises a mixed methods systematic review to map bibliometric data on the POE, associated underpinning processes and benchmarking facilities. Publication and citation metrics are produced via the software VOS-viewer to determine the extent to which POE interrelates with other fields of study (namely, digital technologies and FM).
   Findings - The BOK accrued illustrates that whilst POE has received comparatively scant academic attention in comparison to other fields of study, interest in the area is growing. The work also identifies that a stronger community of practice (CoP) is needed (that comprises of academics and practitioners) to ensure that a consistent approach to POE implementation is developed and that the barriers to POE implementation are addressed.
   Originality/value - Findings presented accentuate the need for design practitioners to reverse engineer POE implementation to inform future design vis-a-vis simply reporting upon an existing building's performance post construction. Other new theories are also introduced as a means of engendering wider academic discourse in this field of science.

AB  - In recent years, climate change has been one of the most complicated problems that human being has faced. Climate change adaptation (CCA) is considered to be an important component of risk management. In order to achieve adaptation, it is necessary to determine the indicators influencing adaptation in each community and this requires measurement and standard tools. The aim of this study is to determine and categorize the indicators of CCA. International electronic databases including Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar were investigated for only articles published in English language. In addition, Iranian databases including Irandoc, SID, and Magiran were investigated. There was no limitation on the methods of studies. Furthermore, snowball method was used for finding more articles while the ProQuest database was searched for related dissertations. The published documents from 1990 to November 2017 were gathered in this study. Out of 4439 publications initially search, 152 full texts were investigated. Finally, a total of 45 potentially relevant citations were included for full text review; in addition, fourteen other sources were investigated. Using snowball method, we found 24 other articles that were included in our final result. From the searches, 176 indicators were identified, while seven main domains were mentioned. Since in the articles, domains of adaptation are not in the form of a model, it is better to focus on this issue in the future and it seems that prioritizing and weighting domains in adaptation in different communities with different needs are an important issue.

AB  - Purpose: To examine prevalence, nutrition and activity, and overweight and obesity prevention and management in Saudi Arabia. Design: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis criteria, PubMed, Web of Science, PyschINFO, Global Health, Family Studies Worldwide, Middle Eastern Studies, and Sociological Abstracts was searched from January 1, 2003 to January 31, 2016. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles published in Arabic and English that focused on prevalence, overweight or obesity in children 2 to 20 years of age, body mass index percentile, and interventions. Findings: Three themes were identified: epidemiological features, where the eastern region had the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity, risk factors, which included higher parental education, and lifestyle factors, which included increased consumption of calorie-dense food and a sedentary lifestyle. Conclusion: Childhood obesity is increasing in Saudi Arabia at an alarming rate. Implications for Practice: Practitioners need to consider the cultural influences of the increasing obesity epidemic in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - This paper follows a bibliometric assessment methodology to provide a systematic review of studies devoted to cultural heritage (CH) buildings that simultaneously refer to hygrothermal conditions and/or behavior and climate change (CC) scenarios. Moreover, this paper aims at identifying the main research trend and research gaps in this combined research field, and to provide a critical discussion of previous works relating to CH, hygrothermal behavior, and CC. Scopus database was used for data gathering and export, followed by VOSviewer for network visualization. The advanced search on the database showed that only 36 documents have considered the study of these three subjects together, as of 2022. The majority of research has been carried out in Italy (27% of the relevant documents). This paper further describes some funded research projects on the topic of CH, hygrothermal behavior, and CC. It was concluded that the investigation on this combined research topic is very recent and scarcely unexplored, and further research is required to assess how future CC scenarios will affect the hygrothermal behavior of CH buildings. These new understandings are fundamental for all stakeholders involved in topics related to heritage conservation and assessment of the hygrothermal behavior of buildings.

AB  - Epilepsy is a significant, but often underappreciated, health problem in Asia. Here, we systematically review the literature on epidemiology, aetiology, and management of epilepsy in 23 Asian countries. Prevalence estimates are available for only 11 countries from door-to-door surveys and are generally low. Figures for annual incidence in China and India are similar to those in the USA and Europe but lower than those reported from Africa and Latin America. There is a peak in incidence and prevalence in childhood, but a second peak in elderly people, as seen in developed countries, has not been documented. The main causes are head injuries, cerebrovascular disease, CNS infections, and birth trauma. Availability of epilepsy care depends largely on economic factors. Imaging and neurophysiological facilities are available in most countries, but often only in urban centres. Costly drugs, a large treatment gap, limited epilepsy surgery, and negative public attitude to epilepsy are other notable features of management in Asia. An understanding of the psychosocial, cultural, economic, organisational, and political factors influencing epilepsy causation, management, and outcome should be of high priority for future investigations.

AB  - With sensors becoming smaller, more accurate and networked, the knowledge about our environment in urban studies can be enriched; thanks to the availability of diffused fine-grained and real-time information layers, the smart city concept can be enhanced as the sustainable city. For example, the use of electrochemical sensors for monitoring urban air quality allows the deployment of multi-scale high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations, pushing the boundary of traditional environmental and urban studies.
   In addition, deploying diffuse biosensors to measure qualitatively and quantitatively specific behavior from communities (i.e. biomarkers) might foster a completely new approach to the study of cities and their urban environment, people, and technology.
   The paper will therefore present a systematic review of previous studies on micro and nano-sensors applied to the smart city concept and projects, stressing challenges and positive outcomes. Monitoring for surveillance, urban management, knowledge support for assessment, and decision making processes are the main features potentially enhanced by the use of sensors for the smart and sustainable city, and starting from the different experiences analyzed, the paper will discuss how sensors are currently changing the way cities are studied and managed.

AB  - The managerial and environmental studies conducted in the energy research area reflect its substantial importance, particularly when optimizing and modifying consumption patterns, transitioning to renewable sources away from fossil ones, and designing plans and systems. The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of the literature allowing us to identify which research subjects have been prioritized in the fields of energy and sustainability in recent years, determine the potential reasons explaining these trends, and categorize the techniques applied to analyze the uncertainty faced by decision-makers. We review articles published in highly ranked journals through the period 2003-2020 and apply text analytics to cluster their main characteristics; that is, we rely on pre-processing and text mining techniques. We analyze the title, abstract, keywords, and research methodology of the articles through clustering and topic modeling and illustrate what methods and fields constitute the main focus of researchers. We demonstrate the substantial importance of fuzzy-related methods and decision-making techniques such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS). We also show that subjects such as renewable energy, energy planning, sustainable energy, energy policy, and wind energy have gained relevance among researchers in recent years.

AB  - The problem of global warming and climate change has attracted global attention, and reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is an important step towards solving the problem. This paper mainly introduces the current development status, research hotspots, challenges and some emerging technologies of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Among CO2 capture technologies, solvent absorption technology is currently the most mature and widely used technology, among which ionic liquid technology has great application prospects because its molecular structure can be designed and different functional groups can be connected. The surface functionalization of metal-organic frameworks in the adsorption method endows them with excellent CO2 adsorption capacity. In CO2 transportation, temperature and pressure must be considered in pipeline transportation, because they will affect the phase state of CO2 transportation. The impact of impurities on CO2 pipeline transportation is a challenge that affects pipeline design and transportation safety. In CO2 utilization, the key to enhanced oil recovery, gas recovery and displacement of coalbed methane is to increase the recovery rate and increase the storage capacity at the same time. Only by strengthening the research on the adsorption behavior between CO2 and CH4 and revealing the relevant mechanism can innovative technologies be developed. The chemical utilization of CO2 has formed many routes, but they all lack certain advantages. Most scholars are working on catalysts for CO2 conversion, especially copper-based catalysts that can convert CO2 into methanol. The conversion rate of CO2 can be effectively increased through doping or process improvement. The coupling of electrocatalytic technology and renewable energy is an important development direction in the future. In CO2 storage, geological storage is currently the most important method, especially in saline aquifers. There are currently critical issues concerning reservoir integrity and leakage potential that should be further investigated. CO2 leakage will cause serious environmental problems, and the common monitoring methods are reviewed and discussed in this paper. Finally, the research status, hotspots and cooperation networks of CCUS are summarized by using CiteSpace software in order to help the development of CCUS technology. In addition, through the review and analysis, it is found that CCUS is faced with challenges such as low capture efficiency, difficulties in transformation and utilization, high operating costs, lack of strong support policies, and lack of international cooperation, which restrict the further development of CCUS.

AB  - There is increasing interest in community gardens where people collectively grow food in cities, reflecting concerns about food insecurity, loss of agricultural biodiversity, pollution, food miles and climate change, among other issues. Mirroring this is a growing corpus of research, but what themes does this literature examine, and how is it evolving including in relation to the findings of a previous systematic review in 2012? To identify who publishes on the topic, from where, in which disciplines and journals, and what are the major themes and gaps in the literature, we used a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach to review 1090 English language articles on community gardens identified from systematic searches of Scopus and Web of Science databases. The literature published from 1972 to 2021 was diverse in terms of discipline, subject area, and journal, but remains mostly about temperate regions, often in the United States of America (USA), with limited consideration of gardens in tropical and subtropical cities and cities in Asia, Africa and South America. Using thematic analyses based on keywords in VOSviewer, as well as titles and abstracts in Leximancer, we found there is ongoing interest in topics such as urbanization, diversity and health. While earlier research often focused on community benefits, recent research is examining climate change, food security and ecosystem services. Important thematic gaps remain including research about agrobiodiversity, the effects of uncertain land tenures and the roles of traditional knowledge in the gardens. The current review highlights how research on community garden continues to provide fruitful insights into diverse aspects of urban food production, while future reviews investigating liter-ature in other languages, including more than just articles, and that used other terminology for the gardens would be beneficial.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure is critical for providing a wide range of ecosystem goods and services that benefit the urban population. Past studies have suggested that multifunctionality concerning urban infrastructure services and functions is a prerequisite for targeting effective and impactful urban green infrastructure. Moreover, urban green infrastructure with multiple functions can offer socio-economic and environmental benefits. However, there has been a knowledge gap in the planning literature to elaborate multiple ecosystem functions in urban green infrastructure. In particular, existing methods and approaches are lacking for quantifying and monitoring such ecological services and biodiversity in urban green infrastructures at different spatial scales. Therefore, this research aims to review studies focusing on the multifunctionality concept in urban green infrastructure plan-ning. The study highlights the current status and knowledge gaps through a systematic review. Our analysis revealed that current studies on green infrastructure multifunctionality have focused on five main themes: 1) planning methods for urban green infrastructure, 2) assessment approaches of urban green infrastructure, 3) ecosystem services and their benefits, 4) sustainability and climate adaptation, and 5) urban agriculture. The study found that the five themes are somewhat connected to each other. The study has revealed a knowledge gap regarding incorporating multifunctional green infrastructure in the planning principle. The results suggest at least five critical elements to ensure multiple functions in urban infrastructure. The elements are spatial distri-bution, optimal distance, integrated network, accessibility, and public participation and engagement. The study further recommends research directions for future analysis on green infrastructure multifunctionality that are critical for urban planning.

AB  - Both research and policy recognize land systems as fundamental to human life and activities. However, these two perspectives approach land from different ends and it can be difficult to see how studied variables contribute to broader policy goals. In this paper, we argue that there is a need to better select variables to study land systems as social-ecological systems, and to align research more with those policy goals. Concentrating on the European continent, we pursue three interrelated objectives: we (1) build a classification of land systems variables, (2) examine where existing land systems research is positioned in this classification, and (3) compare a set of policies and science-policy frameworks with the classified research. To do so, we conduct a systematic review of 69 peer-reviewed, empirical land systems papers, as well as four overarching policies and science-policy frameworks. We find that over 60% of the reviewed papers include both environmental and social variables, and we identify 154 unique variables studied, 57% of which are environmental. The average paper examines four times as many environmental variables as social ones. We find that policies and science-policy frameworks stress social variables more and include health and air quality aspects that are lacking in the reviewed land systems research. Our classification can help to design research that includes both social and environmental variables and is aligned with broader policy goals. We highlight social variables with available spatial data to encourage a more balanced and integrative social-ecological research design, going beyond a focus on the built and natural environment. Our classification can contribute to guiding land systems researchers towards greater policy relevance. We hope that our classification contributes to a conversation within land systems research on the selection of variables, as well as its further development.

AB  - The contemporary business landscape is witnessing an ever-increasing concern for environmental sustainability, which has also surfaced in the apparel industry through the introduction of green apparel. Whether the adoption of green apparel is as a result of growing external pressures on firms to adopt green practices or due to deliberate strategies to incorporate sustainable orientation in the making of products, it remains a topical subject-making a comprehensive account of the existing academic literature indispensable. Furthermore, while academic research on green apparel is undoubtedly at an all-time high, the literature is largely disjointed, necessitating a robust synthesis of the exiting literature to illuminate the existing shortcomings and to provide direction to the future research efforts. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to gauge the existing literary work in this field and to identify research gaps. After the critical review of 90 selected studies, four major themes were extracted: consumer apparel purchase, circular economy, consumer awareness, and barriers. After we identified theme-based critical knowledge gaps in the existing literature, we posed corresponding research questions that provide avenues for future research. The study also constructed a framework with significant practical and theoretical implications. Researchers can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the broader contours of this academic field and, with our meticulously tabulated gaps and potential research questions, explore new dimensions and broaden the horizons of this field.

AB  - The opportunities for the global growth of the bioeconomy (BE) are generated by the need to expand the food supply for an increasing world population without compromising the environment even further. Organic agriculture (OA) claims to be more environmentally friendly than conventional agriculture and capable of addressing sustainable development objectives by using green technologies, resulting in economic, social, and ecological benefits. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between OA and BE through a systematic literature review. We addressed the benefits of OA under perspective of the main aspects of BE. As demonstrated by previous papers assessed on this review, OA can be a means to facilitate strategies for the use of renewable resources to mitigate the emergencies arising from global warming, as claimed by the BE concept. This article introduces a necessary discussion due the lack of previous studies reporting the capacity of OA to connect with the BE. As a final contribution, we present a conceptual framework characterizing potential benefits of OA under the perspective of BE, for organic farmers and researchers to advance in sustainability and green innovation.

AB  - In this research, it was shed light on the imperative of ensuring effective government services and sustainable policies in the context of modernity. The study utilized a combination of scientometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current landscape of public administration and management. The analysis of the latest Scopus publications revealed a noticeable increase in research production over the past five years. There were identified three categories of trends: consolidated, intermediate, and emerging. Prominent themes included governance, transparency, corruption, e-government, and sustainability, while emerging trends encompassed public health, big data, open government, digital transformation, and smart cities. The findings emphasize the critical role of effective governance and citizen participation in shaping health-related policies, as well as the strategic adoption of technologies to improve service delivery. Looking ahead, it is proposed further investigation into emerging and intermediate trends, along with addressing identified thematic gaps such as public-private and international collaboration for sustainable governance, addressing health disparities in vulnerable communities and the role of higher education to develop ethical leaders. Moreover, the impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on achieving developmental goals in developing countries merits in-depth exploration. This research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and practitioners seeking to enhance public administration practices and meet the evolving needs of society.

AB  - It has been more than two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic at the end of 2019. Many scholars have introduced the "resilience" concept into COVID-19 prevention and control to make up for the deficiencies in traditional community governance. This study analyzed the progress in research on social resilience, which is an important component of community resilience, focusing on the current literature on the impact of social resilience on COVID-19, and proposed a generalized dimension to integrated previous relevant literature. Then, VOSviewer was used to visualize and analyze the current progress of research on social resilience. The PRISMA method was used to collate studies on social resilience to the pandemic. The result showed that many current policies are effective in controlling COVID-19, but some key factors, such as vulnerable groups, social assistance, and socioeconomics, affect proper social functioning. Some scholars have proposed effective solutions to improve social resilience, such as establishing an assessment framework, identifying priority inoculation groups, and improving access to technology and cultural communication. Social resilience to COVID-19 can be enhanced by both external interventions and internal regulation. Social resilience requires these two aspects to be coordinated to strengthen community and urban pandemic resilience.

AB  - Considering the current energy consumption worldwide, it has become increasingly important to study the effects of urban heat island on energy consumption in order to improve the environment. This paper investigates the impact of Urban Heat Island (UHI) on energy consumption and also determines which factors can directly affect energy use in the city. The UHI current knowledge and literature are reviewed, as well as how UHI can affect energy consumption. This paper explores literally the conceptual framework of confliction between population and urban structure, which produce UHI intensity and affected energy consumption balance. It is then discussed how these two factors can be affected and gives implication to the city and then, focuses on whether actions should be taken for balancing adaptation and mitigation UHI effects. It will be concluded by making the three important strategies to minimise the impact of UHI on energy consumption: providing an appropriate landscape, using appropriate materials on external surfaces of buildings and urban areas and promoting natural ventilation.

AB  - Evidence of heat mitigation through green infrastructure has been extensively documented and quantified in the literature; however, the effectiveness of implementing these strategies regarding thermal comfort at the pedestrian level has not received the same attention. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the role of UGI strategies on pedestrian the thermal comfort in different climatic contexts. Seventy-six peer-reviewed studies were included, analysed and synthesised for their (i) methodological approaches, (ii) pedestrian-level heat mitigation effects. It is seen that there is a positive association of UGI with pedestrian thermal comfort in temperate, continental, arid and tropical climates. Concerning to heat mitigation effects, street trees, green spaces and green walls have great cooling potential. However, green roofs have a negligible effect at the pedestrian level. The evolution of the role of the UGI for pedestrian thermal comfort in different climatic zones reveals the need to develop urban projects based on choosing the "right tree in the right place". Furthermore, the challenges of evaluating the heat mitigation performance of the UGI require procedures to compensate for psychological influences on thermal perception and standardized monitoring protocols to increase the reliability of the results and allow comparisons between different studies.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning, based on certain principles, has emerged as a way to conceptualise connected greenspace in urbanised environments. This is achieved through the application of processes and approaches linked to policy themes to which the concept can significantly contribute. Taken together the processes, approaches and policy themes constitute the principles of UGI, which when adopted can promote, maintain and enhance quality of life in resource-efficient, compact and climate-resilient cities. In this study we explore the extent to which strategic greenspace planning in Europe is UGI compliant, as we hypothesised that the above principles are presently under-represented in planning documents and policies. This was accomplished by conducting a comparative analysis of the adoption of UGI principles in current practices of greenspace planning across European city-regions based on a systematic review of previous data and reports. The study found that many UGI principles and related concepts are present to some degree in strategic greenspace planning in Europe. However, gaps exist with regard to their scope and level of consideration. Presently, conservation emerges as the predominant task in strategic urban greenspace planning. However, enhancing network connectivity is key to the development of UGI, hence a greater focus on the restoration and creation of greenspace is required in the future. Based on our analysis it can be concluded that the advancement towards UGI planning is well established and progressing, although some areas are markedly under-represented. Strategic greenspace planning in Europe, with a few exceptions, requires further development to be effectively considered as UGI compliant.

AB  - Characterized by inequalities along gender, income, caste, and ethnic differences, urban areas are especially vulnerable to climate risks. Recognizing this, cities are adapting through infrastructural, ecosystem-based, institutional, and behavioural interventions at multiple scales. However, the extent to which these interventions enable or constrain the achievement of specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains unclear. Using a systematic review, we evaluate the impacts of urban adaptation options on SDG 5 (gender equality), This review highlights that the urban adaptation literature tends to focus inordinately on women's differential (and additional) vulnerability to climate risks with limited evidence on the gendered outcomes of adaptation interventions. We find that although some adaptations such as urban agriculture interventions unequivocally increase agency for women, early warning systems and building risk awareness through public messaging showed mixed effects, with the outcomes depending on the implementation of the intervention and socio-cultural context. Further, the analysis indicates that adaptations such as urban agriculture can positively impact agency but, may show negative interactions with other indicators such as women's paid and unpaid work. We also identify key knowledge gaps and reflect on expanding the scope of SDG 5 to take a more intersectional and relational approach to gender equality.

AB  - In recent years, traffic congestion has become increasingly serious and the urban environment has deteriorated, posing a challenge to the modern sustainable transportation system. Sustainable travel behavior is a solution that many scholars recognize as being an important aspect in the development of socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable communities. Increasing numbers of studies analyzed the travel choice behavior based on Random Regret-Minimization (RRM) model. RRM considers multiple attribute compromises to capture the traveler's choice behavior based on minimizing the perceived regret decision criteria. Travel route choice and travel mode choice are interrelated and mutual restraint when a traveler makes a travel decision. To our knowledge, there are limited literatures that overall considered travel mode and travel route choice behavior based on RRM at present. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents a literature review for the application of RRM on sustainable travel mode and travel route choice behavior from empirical issues, influencing factors, theories and methods to evaluate RRM's potential and limitations as a discrete model of travel choice behavior. The results will provide reference for researchers to study this field and develop novel strategies to promote the sustainable traffic system in the future.

AB  - The compact city has garnered significant attention from researchers in academia, particularly in recent years, due to its relevance to various global challenges, such as climate change, COVID-19, economic crises, and urbanization. Given the vast knowledge represented in the compact city literature and its diverse perspectives, this study aims is a comprehensive literature review through bibliometric analysis. Following the PRISMA protocol, a total of 570 articles from the Scopus database published in English between 1973 and 2022 underwent screening at two main levels of bibliometric analysis: performance analysis and science mapping. The findings of this study reveal a substantial increase in scientific production related to the compact city over the years. Furthermore, the concept of the compact city encompasses multiple dimensions, with a significant emphasis on the urban dimension. Remarkably, Asian countries (regions), particularly mainland China and China-Hong Kong, demonstrate a notable interest in the compact city concept. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the scientific production of compact city literature, highlighting its growth, multidimensionality, and geographic focus, which can inform future research and policymaking efforts.

AB  - West Africa is facing the challenge of its population's food insecurity in a context of accelerated degradation of natural resources. In order to efficiently face this double bottleneck, agroecological interventions were implemented as a way to promote best agricultural practices. Agroecology is a mode of production that nowadays questions our food system which, despite technological progress, still struggles to feed the world's population. This systematic review is part of the vision of a deep agroecology and aims at analyzing the institutional, political, organizational, and social obstacles and levers for an agroecological transition and its amplification in Burkina Faso and Benin. For this purpose, a structured literature review was conducted using grey and published literature. It appears that despite the mitigated results of the implementation of the Green Revolution model of agricultural production in West Africa, African public authorities seem to have placed once again their faith in conventional production practices to respond to the challenges facing agriculture in the region. This situation goes beyond the regional framework to take root at the national level, (e.g., Burkina Faso, Benin), with the corollary of an apparent lack of institutional interest in sustainable modes of production. However, there is a network of stakeholders who are developing promising initiatives for scaling up agroecological practices.

AB  - The severity and frequency of flood and drought events have increased in recent decades. These climate change-induced and anthropogenic stressors on water resources represent the leading water-related hazards to communities. Further, the increasing exposure of the population and infrastructure to such events has heightened the risks. Assessing the impact scope of these events in different subfields towards comprehensively evaluating the risks requires an unbiased systematic approach. This paper combines content analysis and science mapping to investigate the existing multidisciplinary body of knowledge on analyzing flood and drought together. Searching the literature using selected search terms yielded a sample of 119 publications. Initially, various contents, such as the authors' keywords, applied methods and indices, and study scale, were extracted from these articles. These contents were then incorporated into the science mapping technique to form communicative networks. Analyzing these publications revealed 13 major research themes, with a sustained focus on hydrological issues. However, a more diverse range of themes was recently revealed, including economy, sociology, insurance, and policymaking. Producing such computational and visual networks explained informative insights that can help further develop both existing and new frameworks to support the management, design and policymaking sectors in responding to both flood and drought events.

AB  - Conservation managers are challenged with the task of compiling management plans in which they have to decide on appropriate actions to meet specific objectives. We argue that support for such decision-making is poor and that decision-makers have little opportunity to capture and evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of alternative management options. The result is that decisions are often made without access to the best quality evidence thus increasing the probability that inappropriate management options will be adopted. The aim of this paper is to propose a mechanism for increasing support by improving information flow to decision-makers within an evidence-based framework. The model of evidence-based practice in medicine and public health is used to explore possibilities for parallel practice in conservation. The processes of management plan and action plan formulation are used as examples of how this model provides opportunities to enhance information flow between scientists and practitioners and to encourage formation of productive partnerships and decision support systems, thereby improving effectiveness. Accessibility of evidence is a key issue addressed through the production of systematic reviews and their results being actively disseminated, in a usable format, to the point of need. The role of funding bodies and particularly governments in catalysing this process is seen as key to achieving more evidence-based conservation practice.

AB  - In recent years, citizen science has proven to be an effective means of monitoring plastic litter, bring potential benefits to professional researchers and authorities, and create awareness on plastic pollution at a society level. This paper aims to review the advances of employing the citizen science approach for plastic litter evaluation and explore the research contributions of these initiatives and their impact at the society and environmental levels. A systematic search was undertaken using the main scientific paper databases and back-referencing from reviewed papers over a period of 10 years. Out of 221 papers found, only 94 papers that discussed plastic litter/waste and citizen science remained in the analysis. Geographically, 66% of the studies were concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere (mostly in USA). The majority were related to clean-up activities that analysed litter density, types, and potential sources. The results showed that citizens can provide data over large geographical regions and can be essential to researchers and authorities in implementing litter management policies. Citizen science programs are effective in creating awareness and increasing education regarding plastic litter pollution and impact. However, it is not clear if they can enhance behavioural changes after participation in field survey programs.

AB  - Diversified cropping systems, especially those including legumes, have been proposed to enhance food production with reduced inputs and environmental impacts. However, the impact of legume pre-crops on main crop yield and its drivers has never been systematically investigated in a global context. Here, we synthesize 11,768 yield observations from 462 field experiments comparing legume-based and non-legume cropping systems and show that legumes enhanced main crop yield by 20%. These yield advantages decline with increasing N fertilizer rates and crop diversity of the main cropping system. The yield benefits are consistent among main crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize) and evident across pedo-climatic regions. Moreover, greater yield advantages (32% vs. 7%) are observed in low- vs. high-yielding environments, suggesting legumes increase crop production with low inputs (e.g., in Africa or organic agriculture). In conclusion, our study suggests that legume-based rotations offer a critical pathway for enhancing global crop production, especially when integrated into low-input and low-diversity agricultural systems.
   Crop rotations including legumes have been proposed as a strategy to enhance food production. Here, the authors conduct a global meta-analysis on legume-based crop rotations, showing that legume pre-crops increase 20% of yield in average across various crops and climatic regions.

AB  - Community management is the accepted management model for rural water supplies in many low and middle-income countries. However, endemic problems in the sustainability and scalability of this model are leading many to conclude we have reached the limits of an approach that is too reliant on voluntarism and informality. Accepting this criticism but recognising that many cases of success have been reported over the past 30 years, this study systematically reviews and analyses the development pattern of 174 successful community management case studies. The synthesis confirms the premise that for community management to be sustained at scale, community institutions need a 'plus' that includes long-term external support, with the majority of high performing cases involving financial support, technical advice and managerial advice. Internal community characteristics were also found to be influential in terms of success, including collective initiative, strong leadership and institutional transparency. Through a meta-analysis of success in different regions, the paper also indicates an important finding on the direct relationship between success and the prevailing socio-economic wealth in a society. This holds implications for policy and programme design with a need to consider how broad structural conditions may dictate the relative success of different forms of community management.

AB  - Continuous cropping (CC) is a common practice in agriculture, and usually causes serious economic losses due to soil degeneration, decreased crop yield and quality, and increased disease incidence, especially in medicinal plants. Continuous cropping obstacles (CCOs) are mainly due to changes in soil microbial communities, nutrient availability, and allelopathic effects. Recently, progressive studies have illustrated the molecular mechanisms of CCOs, and valid strategies to overcome them. Transcriptomic and metabolomics analyses revealed that identified DEGs (differently expressed genes) and metabolites involved in the response to CCOs are involved in various biological processes, including photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and bioactive compounds. Soil improvement is an effective strategy to overcome this problem. Soil amendments can improve the microbial community by increasing the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, soil fertility, and nutrient availability. In this review, we sum up the recent status of the research on CCOs in medicinal plants, the combination of transcriptomic and metabolomics studies, and related control strategies, including uses of soil amendments, crop rotation, and intercropping. Finally, we propose future research trends for understanding CCOs, and strategies to overcome these obstacles and promote sustainable agriculture practices in medicinal plants.

AB  - The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals with 169 targets. The Agenda 2030 of the United Nations envisages a holistic approach to achieve these goals by focusing on humankind and the planet. In this review, we analyzed the scientific literature and technical reports of international bodies such as the United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization relating to traditional ethnobotanical knowledge (TEK). The literature on TEK was mapped with the targets of the SDGs to determine the role of traditional knowledge in the realization of selected goals and targets. Our extensive and systematic reviewing of available literatures suggests that, of the 17 goals, at least seven goals are associated with TEK. To achieve these seven goals, a thorough understanding is required to disentangle the intricacies involving TEK, indigenous people holding TEK, and their future role in achieving the SDGs. Our review points towards the role of TEK in achieving goals linked to poverty, health and wellbeing, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life on land, and partnerships. In summary, we argue that achieving the intended outcomes of the SDGs and the targets requires concerted efforts of all relevant stakeholders, including indigenous communities, common citizens, scientists, policy makers, and world leaders.

AB  - Water quality is declining worldwide and an increasing number of waterbodies lose their ecological function due to human population growth and climate change. Constructed floating wetlands (CFWs) are a promising ecological engineering tool for restoring waterbodies. The functionality of CFWs has been studied in-situ, in mesocosms and in the laboratory, but a systematic review of the success of in situ applications to improve ecosystem health is missing to date.
   This review summarises the pollutant dynamics in the presence of CFWs and quantifies removal efficiencies for major pollutants with a focus on in situ applications, including studies that have only been published in the Chinese scientific literature. We find that well designed CFWs successfully decrease pollutant concentrations and improve the health of the ecosystem, shown by lower algae biomass and more diverse fish, algae and invertebrate communities. However, simply extrapolating pollutant removal efficiencies from small-scale experiments will lead to overestimating the removal capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter of in situ applications. We show that predicted climate change and eutrophication scenarios will likely increase the efficiency rate of CFWs, mainly due to increased growth and pollutant uptake rates at higher temperatures. However, an increase in rainfall intensity could lead to a lower efficiency of CFWs due to shorter hydraulic retention times and more pollutants being present in the particulate, not the dissolved form. Finally, we develop a framework that will assist water resource managers to design CFWs for specific management purposes. Our review clearly highlights the need of more detailed in situ studies, particularly in terms of understanding the short- and long-term ecosystem response to CFWs under different climate change scenarios.

AB  - Cities are characterized by the presence of a dense population with a high potential for interactions between individuals of diverse backgrounds. They appear in parallel to the Neolithic revolution a few millennia ago. The advantages brought in terms of agglomeration for economy, innovation, social and cultural advancements have kept them as a major landmark in recent human history. There are many different aspects to study in urban systems from a scientific point of view, one can concentrate in demography and population evolution, mobility, economic output, land use and urban planning, home accessibility and real estate market, energy and water consumption, waste processing, health, education, integration of minorities, just to name a few. In the last decade, the introduction of communication and information technologies have enormously facilitated the collection of datasets on these and other questions, making possible a more quantitative approach to city science. All these topics have been addressed in many works in the literature, and we do not intend to offer here a systematic review. Instead, we will only provide a brief taste of some of these above-mentioned aspects, which could serve as an introduction to the collection 'Cities as Complex Systems'. Such a non-systematic view will lead us to leave outside many relevant papers, and for this we must apologise.

AB  - With the sustainable development goals has come a renewed global interest in ending hunger and achieving food security, while preventing natural resource degradation. Despite this renewed interest and increased commitments to invest in agricultural development, there is an outstanding debate over the technological trajectories to sustainability. The debate centres on sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) and agroecological intensification (AEI) pathways to agricultural sustainability. Using a systematic literature review approach, this study examines the debate over AEI and SAI. This study employs a theoretical framework based on the economic, social, and ecological dimensions of sustainable agriculture within a policy and institutional space. Based on the sustainability dimensions, a discourse analytical technique is applied to unravel the debate. The results reveal differences in actor composition in the SAI and AEI pathways. Both pathways aim to promote food security with optimal and sustainable use of inputs; however, the actors differ on discourse relating to the concept of farming, the role of genetic engineering, the scale of operation, land use and soil health. Resolving these differences requires a blended sustainability approach that moves beyond the current AEI and SAI debate by acknowledging the tradeoffs and synergies of the socio-economic and ecological dimensions.

AB  - Animal biomass is an important substrate in the anaerobic digestion process. The implementation of a waste technology for energy production, such as the production of biogas from animal waste, has been recognized in many countries as one of the best ways to achieve the Sustainable Energy Development Goals. Without a systematic review of resources and accurate estimation of available sources in terms of the amount of potential electricity, it is impossible to manage biomass rationally. The main aim of the article was to present a new tool for assessing the biomass of animal origin and estimating its potential energy through a computer database, which will be widely available in the end of 2020 to show results from the calculation using the database. This tool is configured to enter the data on the developed and undeveloped biomass resources in production of farm animals in rural areas in Poland. Calculations from the database show the biogas potential of swine and cattle manure and slurry in Poland, which is approximately 5.04 billion m(3), with a 60% share of methane in biogas. It is the value of approximately 3.03 billion m(3) of methane. It is worth underlining that slurry and manure are not high-energy substrates; therefore, it is necessary to introduce more energetic substrate streams to improve the biogas plant efficiency.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review that illuminates the current state of knowledge regarding the specific approaches by which multinational corporations (MNCs) implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the subsidiary level in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach Even though substantial scholarly work has been made to outline MNCs' activities in developing countries, this literature remains fragmented. To support the field in its theoretical as well as empirical advancements, this study conducts a systematic review of this body of literature and content analysis of relevant articles using insights from strategic marketing literature (market driving/proactive and market-driven/reactive approaches). Findings The authors synthesize our findings by presenting a taxonomy of proactive/reactive CSR approaches in developing markets along with propositions that can guide future research in this area. Originality/value Among the key contributions of this study's literature review is the development of a taxonomy of proactive/reactive CSR, bringing together different and fragmented streams of research and viewing them from strategic marketing ("proactive/reactive") perspective. The taxonomy and the two ensuing propositions can advance future CSR-related studies with MNCs in focus by providing both theoretical and empirical guidance.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of the energy planning (EP) activities being conducted in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Of particular interest is the establishment of an understanding of current practices. A matrix of evaluation of literature was developed and applied, to find out who is active in EP, the purposes of EP, how energy demand is considered, the scope of the EP activity, and the specificity of indicators used in the ECOWAS region. Energy planning documents were discovered for ten ECOWAS members and the West African Power Pool (WAPP). Electrical systems planning documents were the most common. A set of common fundamental objectives for the EP activities was found. Disconnections were found between EP Objectives and the Attributes used in the EP activities. Monitoring and verification activities as part of the plans were absent from all of the EP documents. While few similarities were found through the comparison of indicators/attributes used in the EP documents of ECOWAS and those used in more developed countries, in contrast the analysis found similarity between the EP objectives set by the region and those of developed countries.

AB  - As a globally consumed agricultural product, soybeans have long been one of the most important commodities in the current international market. In this regard, the governance of the global soybean supply chain has become one of the central themes in both industry and academia. However, existing scholarly works focusing on sustainability issues and mechanisms for better governance in the soybean chain are rare. Moreover, the relationship among soybean supply chain governance mechanisms remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature to identify key themes or topics and to develop a conceptual framework to guide future research. Based on our inclusion criteria and by considering the Scopus database, we identified and reviewed 55 articles published between 2000 and 2019. In our analysis, four themes were identified in soybean supply chain management: drivers (e.g., land-use conflict), global value chain governance (e.g., REDD+), consequences (e.g., reduced CO2 emissions) and potential barriers (e.g., low market demand). Finally, a conceptual model was proposed that elaborates the linkage of the themes, and a research agenda was proposed to direct studies in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opuntia spp. are cacti with high ecological, economic and conservation interest in semiarid environments, particularly in Mexico. We conducted a systematic search of the existing peer-reviewed literature about the state of knowledge of pollination ecology on these plants. We documented the most studied Opuntia species worldwide with an emphasis on Mexico. We found that only 15% of Opuntia species described have been investigated so far, and studies were mainly focused on comprehension of the biology of a single species. Despite the economic and cultural importance of Opuntia, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the flower-visiting insects and their taxonomic identity. We provide a checklist of the insect species associated with Opuntia spp. Through a circular network, we visualize the complex Opuntia flower-visiting insect relationship, and we detected a set of key species constituting the generalist core of the networks constructed. Since pollination is crucial for crop production, a better understanding of ecological interactions would inform management measures to strengthen biodiversity and agriculture sustainability as well as productivity in arid and marginal lands. Further research on pollination ecology is needed to improve the conservation status of the insects associated with Opuntia species.

AB  - Assuring the quantity and quality of groundwater resources is essential for the well-being of human and ecological health, society, and the economy. For the last few decades, groundwater vulnerability modeling techniques have become essential for groundwater protection and management. Groundwater contamination is highly dynamic due to its dependency on recharge, which is a function of time-dependent parameters such as precipitation and evapotranspiration. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the time-series analysis in the "approximation" process to model the dynamic vulnerability of groundwater contamination. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to critically review the methods used to evaluate the spatiotemporal assessment of groundwater vulnerability. The PRISMA method was employed to search web platforms and refine the collected research articles by applying certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite the enormous growth in this field in recent years, spatiotemporal variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration were not considered considerably. Groundwater contamination vulnerability assessment needs to integrate the multicriteria decision support tools for better analysis of the subsurface flow, residence time, and groundwater recharge. Holistic approaches need to be formulated to evaluate the groundwater contamination in changing climatic scenarios and uncertainties, which can provide knowledge and tools with which to prepare sustainable groundwater management strategies.

AB  - Population increase is exacerbating resource insecurities due to increased demand for already depleted resources. Coupled with climate change, they are the main drivers of both intra- (rural-urban and urban-urban) and inter-migration (from one country to the other). We carried out a systematic review of literature, focusing on available options to ensure water and food security, as well as improve the socio-economic environment, highlighting the drivers of migration in southern Africa. The aim was to develop informed adaptation strategies and build resilience in the advent of accelerated migration. We developed a migration conceptual framework based on the nexus between water, food and socio-economic interlinkages. Urban areas in southern Africa are under immense pressure to accommodate climate refugees from resource stressed rural areas, a situation that is impacting on agricultural production. Most urban areas are exceeding their ecological thresholds to support the built environment, causing some socio-ecological challenges. Nexus planning can inform adaptation planning on permissible migration that are aligned with regional goals such as regional integration, poverty reduction and improved livelihoods. This would also contribute to the region's achievements of the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, through the identification of synergies and trade-offs, nexus planning can inform regional adaptation strategies for positively managing migration leading to sustainable outcomes.

AB  - Intensification of agricultural production and simplification of landscape structure have negatively affected arthropod communities, in particular since the end of Second World War. Agri-environment schemes may partly compensate for these losses and enhance arthropod populations, but their effectiveness is higher in simple landscapes rather than complex landscapes, characterized by a large proportion and diversity of semi-natural areas. As the landscape-scale species pool is known to drive local species richness, we tested our hypothesis that landscape complexity determines local arthropod species richness, whereas local management affects only arthropod abundance. Here we undertake a meta-analysis as part of a wider systematic review of the effects of land use heterogeneity on arthropod species richness. We searched for studies quantifying the effects of agri-environment schemes (e.g. wildflower strips/areas, grassy field margins, organic farming) and landscape complexity on arthropod richness and abundance. We additionally separated vegetation-vs. ground-dwelling taxa, because the effects were hypothesized to be greater in the more mobile vegetation-dwelling taxa. As ex-pected, increasing landscape complexity enhanced arthropod richness, but not their abundance. Unexpectedly, agri-environment schemes did not only support the abundance of arthropods, but also their species richness. This pattern was driven by the vegetation-dwelling, not the ground-dwelling taxa, presumably because the higher mobility of vegetation-dwelling taxa allows faster responses to environmental changes. Our results show that agri-environment schemes in Europe benefit both arthropod abundance and species richness, whereas increasing landscape complexity primarily enhances species richness. This is why both local and landscape management need to be taken into account to halt current biodiversity losses in agricultural landscapes. Agri-environment schemes need to be implemented at a larger spatial and temporal scales to enhance landscape complexity, maintaining or restoring biodiversity sustainably.

AB  - Despite considerable interest in urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in recent decades, its contributions to urban sustainability and human wellbeing remain contested. This systematic literature review examines the geographical landscape of the peer-reviewed literature on UPA and assesses its reported outcomes on sustainability and wellbeing. Following systematic review protocols, we undertook a two-step literature screening and quality assessment process. From a total of 4029 articles, based inclusion-exclusion criteria, we filtered 320 articles for quantitative and 86 for qualitative assessment. Quantitative analysis confirmed an exponential increase in literature on UPA since 2015 and a regional bias towards the Global North. The qualitative analysis identified six thematic outcomes of UPA under three sustainability pillars - environmental sustainability; material well-being; labour and livelihoods; land tenure and urban planning; and food and nutritional security as part of economic sustainability; and subjective and relational wellbeing as well as gender and social differentiation as elements of social sustainability. Environmental sustainability was most discussed, followed by subjective wellbeing and food and nutritional security. Gender and social differentiation issues were least represented in the papers. There remain knowledge gaps around how urban policy and planning can recognise, leverage, and scale up the sustainability and wellbeing co-benefits of UPA.

AB  - Knowing the main factors that influence the degree of flood risk perception of the various actors of an urban system is fundamental to enable behavioral changes and the development of more effective measures to reduce risk and preparedness in the face of the occurrence of a flood. This research aims to evaluate the factors that influence the degree of perception of flood risk in the promotion of assertive actions for adaptation and mitigation of climate change. The methodology involves a systematic review of the literature as a research technique. The studies highlight a trend that respondents with older age, more experience of flooding, higher awareness, lower monthly income, lower schooling and less confidence in the government presented greater perception of risk. In addition, they indicate significant deficiencies in current understandings, highlighting the scarcity of evidence for the relationship between risk perceptions and mitigation behavior, and a failure to make use of theoretical structures in research. It is suggested as a strategy in risk management that it should be adapted to different population groups, considering the characteristics and needs of each of them.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a complex process that affects ecological systems in diverse ways, altering everything from population persistence to ecosystem function. Despite widespread recognition that habitat fragmentation can influence food web interactions, consensus on the factors underlying variation in the impacts of fragmentation across systems remains elusive. In this study, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation and spatial habitat structure on resource consumption in terrestrial arthropod food webs. Across 419 studies, we found a negative overall effect of fragmentation on resource consumption. Variation in effect size was extensive but predictable. Specifically, resource consumption was reduced on small, isolated habitat fragments, higher at patch edges, and neutral with respect to landscape-scale spatial variables. In general, resource consumption increased in fragmented settings for habitat generalist consumers but decreased for specialist consumers. Our study demonstrates widespread disruption of trophic interactions in fragmented habitats and describes variation among studies that is largely predictable based on the ecological traits of the interacting species. We highlight future prospects for understanding how changes in spatial habitat structure may influence trophic modules and food webs.

AB  - Among all the natural and human forces acting on the land surface and shaping Landuse and Landcover (LULC), anthropogenic actions have been a dominant force, which has caused dramatic changes to the LULC throughout the globe. The situation of Kashmir Himalayas is no different. LULC changes are rampant and a cause for several environmental problems in the region. Under the changing climate regime and ever-growing anthropogenic pressures, the long-term analysis of LULC has become a necessity. The present study attempts to track the LULC change through a systematic review of literature, to analyse and discuss the trends and patterns of LULC dynamics in Kashmir Valley. The findings from several studies concerning the region that have applied geospatial technology to detect changes in LULC reveal that the changes have occurred at a faster pace in the last 20 years. Major landuse classes such as agriculture, forest, water, snow, and glaciers have shown a declining trend, in comparison to horticulture and built-up that has shown an increasing trend. These changes in LULC have far-reaching impact on the economy of the region. Climate change, population growth, economic compulsion, and unplanned development among others are the major causes /drivers of intensified LULC changes in the region.

AB  - Measuring, analyzing, and evaluating social, environmental, and economic impact is crucial to aligning the sustainable development strategies of international organizations, governments, and businesses. In this sense, society has been a determining factor exerting pressure for urgent solutions. The main objective of this paper is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the literature about the tools for measuring social impact and their evolution over the last 50 years. The search was conducted in the main academic databases (Scopus and Web of Science), where 924 articles were found from 1969 to 2020 related to the topic. The results of the quantitative analysis show that 71% of the publications were in the last ten years and the most productive countries were the USA and the United Kingdom. The relational analysis identifies 4 large clusters that fragment the literature into different subfields. The most used keywords are linked to the term "Social" in measurement methods, new concepts, and participants. This article contributes to the literature by giving the researcher an insight into the current state of art, trends, categories within the field, and future lines of research.

AB  - This systematic literature review gathers societal vulnerability factors linking climate change and conflict from 53 existing studies. The findings reveal three main points. First, four relevant factors are missing from a previous vulnerability analysis framework proposed by Pearson and Newman: land degradation/land cover, gender, customs, and geographical conditions. Second, two factors, access to technology (e.g., for climate change adaptation) and partially democratic states, are insufficiently studied. Third, classification criteria in the previous framework need revision for accuracy. Considering these points, this study proposes a modified vulnerability analysis framework and offers five suggestions for future research directions in climate security research. First, more qualitative case studies are needed to complement the quantitative work. Second, in particular, cases where conflict was avoided or cooperation was established in high vulnerability areas need further research. Third, further research is needed on understudied factors (e.g., access to technology and partial democracy) and on factors the conventional framework cannot explain (e.g., land degradation/land cover, gender, customs, and geographical conditions). Fourth, no single vulnerability factor leads to conflict in isolation, but only in interaction; their connections must be studied. Finally, case studies are needed on vulnerability factors in countries and regions that have suffered from climate change but have not experienced conflict.

AB  - The decline of freshwater fish biodiversity is proceeding at an alarming and persistent rate. Given that most fish must undertake some form of migration in order to complete their life-cycle, of particular concern is the proliferation of hydropower schemes that block migration routes, as well as a variety of other barriers such as weirs and culverts. Several locations in the southern hemisphere are among the major global hotspots of hydropower development. Mitigation measures for fish passage have traditionally relied on designs developed for strong swimming, generally salmonid species of the northern hemisphere. These designs are ineffective for smaller, relatively weak swimming 'non-sport' fish, such as those found in temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, but there is no detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved. This paper introduces an innovative EU-funded project, KEEPFISH, that aims to address gaps in the knowledge of passage requirements for non-sport fish of the temperate south. The project, beginning in 2016, represents the first systematic attempt to bring together world-leading practitioners in an effort to exchange knowledge and construct a shared vision for fish passage science and policy. This will be achieved through systematic review, expert consultation, ecological modelling, postgraduate training programmes, networking and stakeholder engagement using a novel combination of approaches.

AB  - Many alternative hypotheses have been proposed about the mechanisms governing plant community structure and how plant species compete for resources. Seeking general conclusions requires identifying those hypotheses, describing them and comparing the results of the studies that tested them in a diversity of scenarios. However, comprehensive reviews and comparative studies on the hypotheses that have been actually tested rather than theoretically proposed are lacking. In this study, we focused on the relationships between four variables of interest to plant community and resource competition research: biodiversity, productivity, light and nutrients.
   We performed a novel type of systematic literature search in which we selected studies that had intended to quantify all four variables. From the shortlisted papers (88 out of 1557 initial), we identified causal interactions (effects) by doing a "backwards inference" from the statistical analyses, and assembled them as causal networks. We refer to each particular network as a tested hypothesis. The tested hypotheses that showed the same directionality of effects between the four variables of interest were simplified and grouped as compatible.
   We identified 43 hypotheses that could be classified into groups based on compatibility, with varying degrees of complexity in the number and directionality of relationships tested between variables. Only seven of these hypotheses had been tested in more than one study. The most tested hypothesis (47 times) has been one considering changes in nutrient amount (fertilization) as a sole effect variable driving changes in species richness, biomass and light penetration through canopy. Arguably, this is the simplest hypothesis and associated experimental design that one could think of for this system. Although more complex hypotheses that include indirect effect such as those of light penetration on biomass, would presumably better represent the higher complexity of the natural system, they have been tested only a handful of times each (2-21 times).
   Our results depict the landscape of hypotheses that have been tested for this system, a comparative description of their degrees of complexity, and information on available evidence. This information would be relevant to evaluate whether it is possible to proceed with more rigorous generalizations about mechanisms driving plant community structure. Moreover, our method facilitates the identification of knowledge gaps and mismatches between hypotheses, study designs and statistical tests being performed. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Soil is one of the most important assets of the planet Earth, responsible for maintaining the biodiversity and managing the ecosystem services for both managed and natural ecosystems. It encompasses large proportion of microscopic biodiversity, including prokaryotes and the microscopic eukaryotes. Soil microbiome is critical in managing the soil functions, but their activities have diminutive recognition in few systems like desert land and forest ecosystems. Soil microbiome is highly dependent on abiotic and biotic factors like pH, carbon content, soil structure, texture, and vegetation, but it can notably vary with ecosystems and the respective inhabitants. Thus, unboxing this black box is essential to comprehend the basic components adding to the soil systems and supported ecosystem services. Recent advancements in the field of molecular microbial ecology have delivered commanding tools to examine this genetic trove of soil biodiversity. Objective of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of the work on the soil microbiome, especially since the advent of the NGS techniques. The review also focuses on advances in our understanding of soil communities, their interactions, and functional capabilities along with understanding their role in maneuvering the biogeochemical cycle while underlining and tapping the unprecedented metagenomics data to infer the ecological attributes of yet undiscovered soil microbiome. This review focuses key research directions that could shape the future of basic and applied research into the soil microbiome. This review has led us to understand that it is difficult to generalize that soil microbiome plays a substantiated role in shaping the soil networks and it is indeed a vital resource for sustaining the ecosystem functioning. Exploring soil microbiome will help in unlocking their roles in various soil network. It could be resourceful in exploring and forecasting its impacts on soil systems and for dealing with alleviating problems like rapid climate change.

AB  - Source-sink dynamics investigates species dispersal, mainly at the landscape scale, providing outcomes for conservation problem-solving. Designing conservation plans requires accurately identifying a source or a sink habitat within the landscape. However, this practical use demands a theoretical background and a clear definition of source and sink for its successful implementation. This study investigates the application of the terms source and sink, examining how biological features affect their use, and if they have been consistently applied in published studies. We conducted a systematic review focused on source-sink dynamics and performed descriptive and textual analysis to understand their application. Most research did not expressly state what a source or sink was, leaving a knowledge gap that prevents complete understanding and practical application. The concept of source has different uses and is better detailed than the term sink. The application of source and sink concepts was taxon-dependent; animal requirements are needed to indicate if a population/habitat can play a role as a source or sink. Because these concepts were being used differently, the source-sink terminology hinders fundamental theory, evolutionary perspectives, and applicability for species research and conservation, especially in the tropics, where a significant information gap was found.

AB  - This paper addresses the ecological changes and urban unsustainability in metropolises of Iran based on three important indicators: administrative-political centralization, worn-out tissues and urban security. Urban unsustainability engineering is a process in urban planning and urbanization that has not been administrated and managed based on Iranian regional architecture and urban planning. The research data were gathered from a statistical analysis of documents and techniques in a systematic review (1956-2016). The results of the study demonstrated that metropolises of Iran had undergone an unsustainable growth trend. The government seeks to improve indicators of urban sustainable engineering and centralization of the metropolis. Over the past 60 years, cities have been facing rapid growth and development in Iran so that development-oriented governments can play a significant role in tackling growth and urban problems. These problems are especially evident in the socioeconomic and unsustainability of urban ecology. The rapid growth of urbanism and urbanization (74% in 2016) has culminated in the emergence of metropolitan areas in an unstable process. Also in metropolitan areas of Iran, environmental and ecological threats, rural-urban migration and marginalization have posed a serious national-regional challenge. The structural-functional reforms in Iran have been accompanied with skeletal-spatial and socioeconomic changes in cities, giving rise to a new social class called the low-income characterized with non-formal businesses and informal settlements in the outskirts of metropolitan areas.

AB  - Environmental labeling is a valuable communication and marketing tool used to enlarge the visibility and disclosure of environmental attributes of products, processes, and services. Therefore, scientists worldwide are investigating the use of environmental labeling and its possible compliance with technical and economic standards. This paper has examined the scientific output on environmental labeling over the past twenty-two years, reviewing the literature in three scientific databases. A total of 1,246 articles indexed out of 580 magazines were retrieved. The USA contributed most publications on environmental labels. European countries, such as Italy and Sweden, discussed labeling in the food industry, transportation, and forest certification. Brazil is leading Latin America in publications, including the food industry and civil construction. Type I ISO labeling has been the most used, followed by a growing number of publications on Type III ISO labels in recent years. The results display a tendency in aquaculture and food applications in Europe and South America, exhibiting a panorama of advancing scientific and practical strength of environmental labeling in such areas. Finally, we recommend simple, step-by-step activities for consumers to obtain additional benefits by choosing more sustainable products based on the information available on environmental labels.

AB  - From the 21st century to the present(2021), a worldwide awareness that cities' development must be based on projects for socio-economic growth and environmental protection is increasing. World governmental agencies and the European Union have suggested action strategies for the construction of << prototype cities >> whose value must be founded on the inclusion and/or preservation of anthropic-natural elements and their effects on territories. In order to minimize the theoretical-practical gap between planning and project design with a view to sustainable development and the evaluation of their performance from economic, social and environmental points of view, the present contribution aims to outline a framework useful for systematizing the main scientific contributions concerning sustainability and the evaluation of urban transformation projects. The objective is pursued by analyzing bibliographic references with specific regard to the use of logical-operative methodologies used to rationalize the processes of interventions' evaluation and selection. The task of examining the available literature is carried out with an investigation protocol of four sequential steps. From the implementation of the last one, the evidence expressing the heterogeneity of the examples in the literature is described. Accordingly, the theoretical-methodological framework for the project evaluation from an urban sustainability perspective is illustrated.

AB  - Natural hazards are naturally occurring physical events that can impact human welfare both directly and indirectly, via shocks to ecosystems and the services they provide. Animal-mediated pollination is critical for sustaining agricultural economies and biodiversity, yet stands to lose both from present exposure to natural hazards, and future climate-driven shifts in their distribution, frequency, and intensity. In contrast to the depth of knowledge available for anthropogenic-related threats, our understanding of how naturally occurring extreme events impact pollinators and pollination has not yet been synthesized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the potential impacts of natural hazards on pollinators and pollination in natural and cultivated systems. From a total of 117 studies (74% of which were observational), we found evidence of community and population-level impacts to plants and pollinators from seven hazard types, including climatological (extreme heat, fire, drought), hydrological (flooding), meteorological (hurricanes), and geophysical (volcanic activity, tsunamis). Plant and pollinator response depended on the type of natural hazard and level of biological organization observed; 19% of cases reported no significant impact, whereas the majority of hazards held consistent negative impacts. However, the effects of fire were mixed, but taxa specific; meta-analysis revealed that bee abundance and species richness tended to increase in response to fire, differing significantly from the mainly negative response of Lepidoptera. Building from this synthesis, we highlight important future directions for pollination-focused natural hazard research, including the need to: (a) advance climate change research beyond static "mean-level" changes by better incorporating "shock" events; (b) identify impacts at higher levels of organization, including ecological networks and co-evolutionary history; and (c) address the notable gap in crop pollination services research-particularly in developing regions of the world. We conclude by discussing implications for safeguarding pollination services in the face of global climate change.

AB  - The rapid expansion of citrus orchards and their increased cultivation intensity have accelerated soil erosion, which has impeded the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In citrus orchards, the benefits of soil and water conservation measures for alleviating soil erosion have been widely tested at the plot scale. These studies provide crucial information, but they inevitably involve considerable uncertainty and cannot fully characterize the efficacy of soil and water conservation measures. Given the seriousness of soil erosion in citrus orchards and the uncertain factors in the efficiency of soil and water conservation measures, data published in the literature were collected. A meta-analysis of 346 plots (representing 4443 events) for runoff and 307 plots (representing 3596 events) for soil loss was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of soil and water conservation measures in citrus orchards. This study aims to (i) summarize the level of soil erosion in citrus orchards worldwide, (ii) explore the influence of soil and water conservation measures on soil erosion control in citrus orchards and (iii) identify the trade-offs between runoff reduction and soil loss reduction. The results showed that the citrus orchards without soil and water conservation measures had a probability of approximately 80% of exceeding tolerable levels of soil loss. The effectiveness of soil and water conservation measures in reducing soil erosion decreased in the order biological measures + engineering measures > engineering measures > biological measures. The trade-off between runoff reduction and soil loss reduction showed that soil and water conservation measures provide better soil loss control than runoff control. Overall, besides considering the ecological benefits of soil and water conservation measures, decision maker should also consider the economic benefits to obtain an optimal citrus orchard management for farmers.

AB  - Urban food systems are connected with several pressing issues, including urban population growth, resource scarcity, and climate change. To cope within these issues, urban food systems need to become more sustainable in their practices, as well as resilient in the face of extreme weather events. While scholars have started to investigate this topic, no comprehensive analysis has yet addressed what entails sustainable and resilient urban food systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, this paper aims to improve our understanding of the key components of sustainable and resilient urban food systems. This study reviewed 53 publications and identified components related to the health, social, economy, environment, and governance domains. Only 5 of the works included in the review discussed sustainability and resilience to the impacts of climate change in urban food systems simultaneously, so there is an opportunity for original research and analysis. The most frequently identified components of urban food systems relate to: access to healthy food; connectivity between urban and rural areas; having a strong local food economy and food production; reducing food waste; and, having active participation of all actors in decision making. There is some level of consensus on linking sustainability and resilience, but diversity in food sources and the development of social capabilities need to be emphasised for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Social media are being increasingly used to inform visitor use management in parks and protected areas. We review the state of the scientific literature to understand the ways social media has been, and can be, used to measure visitation, spatial patterns of use, and visitors' experiences in parks and protected areas. Geotagged social media are a good proxy for actual visitation; however, the correlations observed by previous studies between social media and other sources of visitation data vary substantially. Most studies using social media to measure visitation aggregate data across many years, with very few testing the use of social media as a visitation proxy at smaller temporal scales. No studies have tested the use of social media to estimate visitation in near real-time. Studies have used geotags and GPS tracks to understand spatial patterns of where visitors travel within parks, and how that may relate to other variables (e.g., infrastructure), or differ by visitor type. Researchers have also found the text content, photograph content, and geotags from social media posts useful to understand aspects of visitors' experiences, such as behaviors, preferences, and sentiment. The most cited concern with using social media is that this data may not be representative of all park users. Collectively, this body of research demonstrates a broad range of applications for social media. We synthesize our findings by identifying gaps and opportunities for future research and presenting a set of best practices for using social media in parks and protected areas.

AB  - The rapid transmission of COVID-19 has meant that all economic and human efforts have been focused on confronting it, ignoring environmental aspects whose consequences are causing adverse situations all over the planet. The saturation of the sanitary system and confinement measures have multiplied the waste generated, which implies the need to adapt environmental policies to this new situation caused by the pandemic. It is a review article whose objective was to identify the environmental policies that would facilitate an adequate treatment of the waste generated by the pandemic. It was proposed to analyse the current lines of research developed on this paradigm, applying the text mining methodology. A systematic review of 111 studies published in environmental journals indexed in the Web of Science was carried out. The results identified three areas of interest: knowledge of transmission routes, management of the massive generation of plastics and appropriate treatment of solid waste in extreme situations. Leaders are called upon to implement the contingency plans to sustainably alleviate the enormous waste burden caused by society's adaptation to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Specifically, innovation aimed at achieving the reuse of medical products, the promotion of the circular economy and educational campaigns to promote clean environments should be encouraged.

AB  - It is worldwide accepted that climate change is affecting cities and that the conservation of the cultural heritage contributes to sustainable development. However, despite the high level of interest and research in climate change risks on socioeconomic, urban and natural systems, studies that assess climate change impacts on urban cultural heritage and contribute to a holistic understanding on the subject present noticeable gaps in knowledge. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the state -of-the-art of cultural heritage risk assessment methodologies within urban systems in the context of climate change, specifically historic urban areas. For this purpose, a systematic search was applied using Web of Science and Scopus. The search identified and characterized existing methodologies on vulnerability and risk assessment for cultural heritage in a changing climate following the PRISMA protocol, and it synthesized knowledge gaps to be addressed in the near future. This study aims to bring risk assessment methodologies closer to urban planners for more efficient climate change adaptation policies. The research concluded that there is an unbalance between the amount of methodologies for the different climate change derived hazards and their impacts on historic urban areas. The amount of methodologies focused on flooding highlights that further research is needed for other relevant hazards, like heat and cold waves, that contribute to a holistic perspective.

AB  - Regenerative approaches to the built environment represent a conceptual departure from reductionist sustainability fields. By utilizing the inherent interconnections between social-ecological systems as an informing foundation, regenerative fields have the potential to facilitate transformation towards sustainable cities. This paper provides a systematic review of publications on urban regenerative thinking and practice, including across urban development stages and sectors. Results indicate precincts as the optimum scale for regenerative intervention and provide insights into the worldviews underpinning regenerative approaches. The targets and aspirations of regenerative fields are well-documented, along with the practical challenges to effective implementation. Gaps in the literature are identified including paradigmatic and definitional inconsistencies across urban regenerative thinking and practice. Similarly, there is a lack of detail on the realization of planning aspirations at subsequent stages of building lifecycles. The sample also does not extensively outline the specific engagement mechanisms required to remove barriers to regenerative practice or encourage its uptake across geographic and legislative contexts. Whilst the operationalization of regenerative principles in high-density urban environments remains a challenge, these fields offer transformative frameworks to not only mitigate further harm but also achieve net-positive natural and social outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: This paper seeks to explore from an historical perspective the way in which political climates impinge upon the public and professional perception of what constitutes appropriate provision for people with an intellectual disability.
   Methods: A systematic review of literature relating to policy and provision for people with an intellectual disability in England was undertaken.
   Results: Evidence drawn from the disciplines of cultural anthropology and history demonstrates that people with an intellectual disability have been identified across cultures and historical epochs. In the three decades following the end of World War 2 (WW2), a significant development occurred in England: as a result of pioneering research work undertaken by a small group of psychologists, drawn mainly from countries beyond England, the learning potential of children and young people with an intellectual disability was demonstrated. The findings from this research led to landmark changes in legislation. The present paper seeks to underscore the fact that the changes in provision for people with an intellectual disability in the thirty years following the end of WW2 resulted from the findings of well-conceived and executed research.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need to discuss the future shape of all services for people with an intellectual disability but in a professional climate characterised by informed analysis and not ideological preference.

AB  - A small standing-water ecosystem (SWE) is a shallow (<20 m) lentic water body with a surface of a few hectares (<= 10 ha). Compared to larger counterparts, they exhibit wider ecotones, sometimes even equaling their whole surface, which maximizes structural heterogeneity, supporting exceptionally high biodiversity, metabolic rates, and functionality. Surprisingly, no binding regulations support global strategies for SWE conservation. This work consists of a literature review performed for the period 2004-2018 to assess the ecological and conservation value of SWEs and the contribution of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in promoting their conservation. Outcomes from this work open new perspectives on SWEs, which emerge as valuable ecosystems, and confirm their pivotal contribution to watershed biodiversity, resilience, and functionality. Results also suggest clear narrative trends and large knowledge gaps across geographical areas, biological components, and target issues. Additionally, we note that SWEs are under-represented in the frame of WFD implementation, stressing their marginality into assessing procedures. All of this calls for further studies, especially outside Europe and with a global, multi-taxon perspective. These should be devoted to quantitatively assess the roles of SWEs in maintaining global water ecosystem quality, biodiversity, and services, and to prioritize management actions for their conservation.

AB  - This paper outlines the necessity of planning and design provisions on urban built environment from children's understanding and aspirations' perspective. Their understanding and aspirations are analyzed through survey and a result presentation was prepared using research tools like mind maps, place representation and annotated drawings of dream neighborhood by 271 children of class 5 and class 8 from three renowned schools of Khulna, Bangladesh. Khulna, as a divisional city, is under rapid urbanization process, therefore, facing mounting pressure to build a child-friendly and livable environment which will support its growing urban population and future generations. Thereby, identifying children's understanding of built environment and highlighting their aspirations, this paper also provides solution measures for future planning and design within its scope. Thereafter, with a systematic review of Khulna Development Authority prepared structure plan, referring to the aspired child friendly built environment issues, it has been found that most of the planning provisions are available inside the plan document. However, zoning and development control mechanisms as well as maintenance of existing provisions lack the goodwill of respective authorities. Finally, this study reflects that children's participation in the planning process and the level of their cognitive perception is crucial to achieve a sustainable and child friendly built environment.

AB  - Background. Community-based health workers (CBHWs) are frontline public health workers who are trusted members of the community they serve. Recently, considerable attention has been drawn to CBHWs in promoting healthy behaviors and health outcomes among vulnerable populations who often face health inequities.
   Objectives. We performed a systematic review to synthesize evidence concerning the types of CBHW interventions, the qualification and characteristics of CBHWs, and patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of such interventions in vulnerable populations with chronic, noncommunicable conditions.
   Search methods. We undertook 4 electronic database searches-PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane-and hand searched reference collections to identify randomized controlled trials published in English before August 2014.
   Selection. We screened a total of 934 unique citations initially for titles and abstracts. Two reviewers then independently evaluated 166 full-text articles that were passed onto review processes. Sixty-one studies and 6 companion articles (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis) met eligibility criteria for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis. Four trained research assistants extracted data by using a standardized data extraction form developed by the authors. Subsequently, an independent research assistant reviewed extracted data to check accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved through discussions among the study team members. Each study was evaluated for its quality by 2 research assistants who extracted relevant study information. Interrater agreement rates ranged from 61% to 91% (average 86%). Any discrepancies in terms of quality rating were resolved through team discussions.
   Main results. All but 4 studies were conducted in the United States. The 2 most common areas for CBHW interventions were cancer prevention (n = 30) and cardiovascular disease risk reduction (n = 26). The roles assumed by CBHWs included health education (n = 48), counseling (n= 36), navigation assistance (n= 21), case management (n= 4), social services (n = 7), and social support (n = 18). Fifty-three studies provided information regarding CBHW training, yet CBHW competency evaluation (n = 9) and supervision procedures (n = 24) were largely under-reported. The length and duration of CBHW training ranged from 4 hours to 240 hours with an average of 41.3 hours (median: 16.5 hours) in 24 studies that reported length of training. Eight studies reported the frequency of supervision, which ranged from weekly to monthly. There was a trend toward improvements in cancer prevention (n = 21) and cardiovascular risk reduction (n = 16). Eight articles documented cost analyses and found that integrating CBHWs into the health care delivery system was associated with cost-effective and sustainable care.
   Conclusions. Interventions by CBHWs appear to be effective when compared with alternatives and also cost-effective for certain health conditions, particularly when partnering with low-income, underserved, and racial and ethnic minority communities. Future research is warranted to fully incorporate CBHWs into the health care system to promote noncommunicable health outcomes among vulnerable populations.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to summarize the principles of harmonization of economic relations between participants of the agrofood market of Ukraine, in particular, the livestock products market, and to create a system of criteria for socio-ecological and economic assessment of the level of harmony of these relations with adherence to the principle of inclusivity. The results of a systematic review convincingly show that the basic principles of harmonization of economic relations between the livestock market participants shall be as follows: the principle of inclusivity, maximizing the mutual benefit of all parties to relationship, the consistency of their economic interests (or the principle of consensus), the principle of systematization, controllability, social fairness, openness and scientific validity. With the help of three indicator systems, namely: (1) criteria for assessing the socio-economic conditions of the livestock market entities, (2) criteria for assessing the development effectiveness and efficiency of the specified market entities, (3) criteria for assessing the harmonious relations of agricultural producers with other participants in relations on the product market animal husbandry, it is possible to systematically explore the economic environment in which modern economic relations between the livestock production market participants are formed, developed and transformed, and to find mechanisms for harmonizing such relations.

AB  - Purpose The maintenance of process improvement programs within organizations is not an easy task. Some processes do not maintain the results achieved with the improvement project and again present low performance shortly after completion of the project. This paper aims to identify the socio-technical causes responsible for the loss of process performance after applying improvement projects, in order to support the mitigation of the problem. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the literature was carried out, which allowed the selection of 28 articles. The empirical stage used the benchmarking technique, along a large Brazilian mining company with an international standard of production and quality. This organization has been using improvement projects for more than ten years. Findings The research complements the literature regarding the prioritization of the 26 identified failures and the identification of seven new failure factors and two resources. Findings in this study can be an inspiration for other organizations, considering the similarity of methodological aspects of improvement projects since internationally standardized methodologies such as Six Sigma, Lean, Kaizen and 5S are used. Originality/value The research presented a proposal of guidelines that corroborate to the mitigation of loss of process performance after improvement project.

AB  - The concept of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has emerged in response to the need to highlight and ensure access to the multifunctional benefits of green spaces in changing cityscapes. Recent literature reviews around UGI have focused on environmental benefits and services, and the management of these spaces has been comparatively neglected. In addition to this, the core conceptual and practical research around UGI management has been produced in the Global North, and far less research has been generated in Latin America, despite the contextual challenges and opportunities brought by this rapidly urbanizing and diverse region. In response, this trilingual systematic review asks: What are the research trends in terms of topics and case studies that characterize UGI management research in Latin America? Which management types are the focuses of this research? A total of 47 publications, found through Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO, were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The research was both geographically concentrated and predominantly recent. Government-led initiatives made up the highest proportion of the research, and more than half of the publications described local government as the principle actor in the management of the UGI studied. Community-run initiatives were consistent across the temporal span of the articles found, and their established presence was supported by the qualitative review. Findings also revealed a directional push toward governance practices but significant obstacles in the form of weak local government, divisions driven by a lack of context-sensitive approaches to informal settlements and socioeconomic segregation, and amanagement discourse that jarred with urban practices by indigenous communities. Through demonstrating the contribution of existing literature on UGI management in Latin America, this review highlights the need for further published research on the region.

AB  - The global trend toward a green sustainable future encouraged the penetration of renewable energies into the electricity sector to satisfy various demands of the market. Successful and steady integrations of renewables into the microgrids necessitate building reliable, accurate wind and solar power forecasters adopting these renewables' stochastic behaviors. In a few reported literature studies, machine learning- (ML-) based forecasters have been widely utilized for wind power and solar power forecasting with promising and accurate results. The objective of this article is to provide a critical systematic review of existing wind power and solar power ML forecasters, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and extreme learning machines (ELMs). In addition, special attention is paid to metaheuristics accompanied by these ML models. Detailed comparisons of the different ML methodologies and the metaheuristic techniques are performed. The significant drawn-out findings from the reviewed papers are also summarized based on the forecasting targets and horizons in tables. Finally, challenges and future directions for research on the ML solar and wind prediction methods are presented. This review can guide scientists and engineers in analyzing and selecting the appropriate prediction approaches based on the different circumstances and applications.

AB  - Government-level ESG (environmental, social, and governance) institutionalization and active ESG activation in the private sector are being discussed for the first time this year in Korea, spurred by increased national interest since the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the declaration of a carbon-neutral society by 2050, and ESG discussion in many fields is spreading rapidly. In addition, global awareness of the crisis caused by environmental pollution and natural disasters has highlighted the importance of green infrastructure (GI) as a new conceptual alternative to improve public value. Based on sustainability, which is a common goal of ESG and green infrastructure, this study aimed to examine the research targets and techniques of green infrastructure from the perspective of ESG. This study selected and analyzed 98 domestic and international academic journal papers published over the past 10 years in the Web of Science academic journal database literature collection. Focusing on the research subjects, the focus on green infrastructure, and research keywords, we examined the aspects of the green infrastructure plan that have been focused on from the ESG perspective and compared domestic and international research trends. In addition, implications for how each research topic is connected to the concept of ESG according to its function and purpose were derived. By examining the domestic and international research trends of green infrastructure from the ESG perspective, we identified the need for a wider range of research on the diversity and relationship between humans and the ecological environment; policies and systems; and technical research that does not focus only on a specific field. In this regard, we intend to increase the contribution to ESG management in the public sector through the establishment of green infrastructure plans and policies in the future, as they account for a large portion of public capital.

AB  - Compensatory growth represents the ability of plants to counteract the negative consequences of herbivore damage, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture. Minor changes in compensatory growth due to environmental changes may significantly impact the structure and functionality of ecosystems, especially for agriculture in a semiarid region. However, there is a lack of systematic quantitative summaries and reviews on compensatory growth mechanisms, especially regarding how they might respond to global environmental changes (e.g. climate warming, drought, nutrient variation, and elevated CO2). This paper summarizes the types of physio-ecological responses of plant compensatory growth to defoliation and their characteristics through a systematic review of existing literature. The review shows that damaged plants that undergo variations in morphological and physiological traits, such as enhanced photosynthesis, increased branching, and altered biomass allocation, may mitigate injury or produce overcompensatory growth. Moderate disturbance and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus infection rates are beneficial for overcompensation. I further discuss how plant compensatory growth is affected by global change factors, concluding that adequate nutrients and water supply are crucial factors influencing overcompensation. This summary can advance our understanding of the response patterns and mechanisms underlying plant compensatory growth, which is vital for gaining insight into the regenerative capacity of plants and promoting sustainable agricultural development under global environmental changes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel and mobility of various population groups worldwide. These impacts were more pronounced for older adults, who, in various countries around the world, were instructed to quarantine for prolonged periods and avoid contact with others. The impact of these disruptions has been differently experienced between countries and geographical regions with levels of economic development and transport infrastructures playing a role. The aim of this article is firstly, to critically synthesise scientific literature about changes in travel behaviour and transport choices of older adults caused by the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries, secondly, highlight the main gaps in the literature and finally, provide avenues for future research and transport policies. Findings indicate inequalities in access to transport explained by built environment design and policies adopted by governments to control the pandemic, as well as socio-economic and developmental factors. The implications of these findings for transport provision and increased mobility for older adults in the post-pandemic world are outlined. Finally, we discuss the importance of active aging policies, which could create more transportation options to support older adults' mobility needs and access in the post-COVID-19 era in both high- and low-income countries.

AB  - Sustainable tourism research focuses on mitigating or remediating environmental, social and economic impacts on tourism. In the past years, Big Data approaches have been applied to the field of tourism allowing for remarkable progress. However, there seems to be little evidence to support that such approaches are an inspiration to sustainable tourism and are being implemented. In this context, we aim to obtain a comprehensive overview of the use of Big Data in sustainable tourism to address various issues and understand how Big Data can support decision-making in such scenarios. To that end, this paper reports on the results of a literature review via a combination of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Software Engineering, and the use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. In summary, we investigated four facets: (a) sources of big data, (b) approaches, (c) purposes, and (d) contexts of application. The results suggest that the use of various approaches have impacted practices in sustainable tourism. The findings provide a thorough understanding of the state of the art of Big Data application in sustainable tourism and provide valuable insights to foster growth both in terms of research and practice.

AB  - This review examines the global literature concerning HIV/STI risk among trafficked female sex workers (FSWs), in relation to sex trafficking and drug use. The compound effects of sexual and drug-related risk merit a systematic literature review to grant a better understanding of their role in HIV/STI transmission. The current review synthesizes the results of 21 studies conducted in multiple cultural settings. Though the selected studies similarly found heightened HIV risks faced by trafficked FSWs, the focuses varied from the effect of trafficking on HIV, to the effect of entry age to sex work on HIV, to the effects of various forms of violence on HIV, to the effect of HIV risk behaviors on HIV, and to the relationship between HIV and other STIs. While focuses and findings varied, they are in consensus that various forms of violence and diminished autonomy, as a result of sex trafficking, accelerate the FSWs' risks of HIV/STIs even in comparison to women who voluntarily enter the sex trade. Variations in findings may be attributed to specific socio-cultural settings and various research methods as well as differences in the risk factors being studied. This points to the need for more empirical studies - particularly those that specifically target trafficked FSWs and the mechanisms of HIV/STI transmissions among the highly vulnerable population..

AB  - This paper investigates the contribution of business model innovations in the advancement of novel food supply chains. Through a systematic literature review, the notable business model innovations in the food industry are identified, surveyed, and evaluated. Findings reveal that the innovations in value proposition, value creation processes, and value delivery processes of business models are the successful strategies proposed in food industry. It is further disclosed that rural female entrepreneurs, social movements, and also urban conditions are the most important driving forces causing farmers to reconsider their business models. In addition, the new technologies and environmental factors are the secondary contributors in business model innovation for the food processors. It is concluded that digitalization has disruptively changed the food distributor models. E-commerce models and Internet-of-Things are reported as the essential factors causing retailers to innovate their business models. Furthermore, consumption demand and product quality are two main factors affecting the business models of all the firms operating in the food supply chain regardless of their positions in the chain. The findings of the current study provide an insight into the food industry to design a sustainable business model to bridge the gap between food supply and food demand.

AB  - This study aims to comprehensively synthesize existing literature on AI in tourism, highlighting key themes, strengths, and limitations, and illuminating pathways for future research, including the identification of emerging areas within this context. AI technology is rapidly transforming various sectors, including tourism, by augmenting customer service, improving operational efficiency, personalizing travel experiences, and supporting sustainability initiatives. Despite the growing body of research on this topic, there is a need for a comprehensive and systematic summary of the existing literature to illuminate the most effective uses of AI in this context and to identify gaps for future research. We employed the 'overview of reviews' methodology, which involved systematically locating, appraising, and synthesizing the results of previous review articles. Using Web of Science, we identified and analyzed 31 previous review articles on the application of AI in tourism. Their synthesis presents a comprehensive perspective on the present status of AI technology in the tourism sector. It provides valuable insights, not only for practitioners contemplating the implementation of AI solutions but also for academics aspiring to advance this study area. Moreover, the academic implications of this study reaffirm its objective to shape future inquiries into AI applications within tourism, advocate for the efficacious and sustainable employment of AI, and provoke scholarly exploration at the nexus of technology and sustainability in this sector.

AB  - Abandoned mines are widely known for their environmental problems and public health and safety hazards. Although this is the case, the literature shows that the environmental problems of abandoned mines have received more attention from scholars than their physical hazards and other related problems. This review paper discusses the physical hazards of abandoned mines with a special focus on the situation of these mines in South Africa. The systematic review of the literature including scientific articles published in journals indexed to the Web of Science and Google Scholar database and other grey literature accessible through Google Search was conducted to investigate the different physical hazards of abandoned mines in South Africa. The review looked at the safety hazards and risks of disused mine shafts, surface excavation, ground subsidence, and other objects such as dilapidated buildings, infrastructure, old equipment, as well as residue waste. The last part of the paper deliberates on the practical approach for effectively closing abandoned mines in the country with the aim of addressing their hazards to support sustainable alternative uses of the closed abandoned mine sites. The conclusion emphasized the importance of incorporating a vigorous awareness campaign and effective postclosure monitoring and maintenance into the program of closing abandoned mines in South Africa.

AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to carry out a comprehensive literature mapping to synthesise and descriptively analyse the research trends of biodiversity accounting, providing implications for managers and policymakers, whilst also outlining a future agenda for scholars.
   Design/methodology/approach - A bibliometric analysis is carried out by adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses protocol for searching and selecting the scientific contributions to be analysed. Citation analysis is used to map a current research front and a bibliographic coupling is conducted to detect the connection networks in current literature.
   Findings - Biodiversity accounting is articulated in five thematic clusters (sub-areas), such as "Natural resource management", "Biodiversity economic evaluation", "Natural capital accounting", "Biodiversity accountability" and "Biodiversity disclosure and reporting". Critical insights emerge from the content analysis of these sub-areas.
   Practical implications - The analysis of the thematic evolution of the biodiversity accounting literature provides useful insights to inform both practice and research and infer implications for managers, policymakers and scholars by outlining three main areas of intervention, i.e. adjusting evaluation tools, integrating ecological knowledge and establishing corporate social legitimacy.
   Social implications - Currently, the level of biodiversity reporting is pitifully low. Therefore, organisations should properly manage biodiversity by integrating diverse and sometimes competing forms of knowledge for the stable and resilient flow of ecosystem services for future generations.
   Originality/value - This paper not only updates and enriches the current state of the art but also identifies five thematic areas of the biodiversity accounting literature for theoretical and practical considerations.

AB  - Resources and environment management have always been a research hotspot. In the context of sustainable development and environmental governance, scholars and policy makers have been increasing their research efforts on natural resource utilization and its environmental impact. By using the Web of Science Core Collection database, this article applies the bibliometric method to accomplish a systematic review about studies on accounting and management of natural resource consumption based on input-output method. The results indicate that both in terms of the quantity and quality of academic achievements and international cooperation, China is in high academic position and has made great contributions to the development in this research field. While energy and water account for a large proportion of the study objects, more attention is paid on the other kinds of natural resources, such as land, metal, and ocean. International trade is an eternal hot topic in this field. With the continuous progress of the multi-regional input-output model, the importance and feasibility in the analysis of sub-national level or region in the global supply chain gradually emerged. Combining input-output model with other methods can obtain more comprehensive and accurate results for scientific decision-making. Meanwhile, the uncertainty and limitations inherent in such models clearly need further attention.

AB  - The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and leadership has received considerable research attention in recent decades. While there have been several qualitative reviews, quantitative and systematic reviews of CSR-leadership links remain absent. The current paper seeks to address this gap by using a bibliometric method to analyze and visualize the evolution and research trends within the CSR-leadership domain. Drawing from a sample of 1432 peer-reviewed articles, we map the landscape of the CSR-leadership research domain and identify key developments and patterns over the period 1994-2020. In addition to highlighting a range of publication trends including key theoretical influences, the findings also reveal an acceleration in the volume and breadth of CSR-leadership research. Seven subdomains (or clusters) are further identified (i.e., board characteristics, responsible leadership, emerging country context, team efficacy, CEO pay fairness, shareholder wealth, and cross-sector social partnership) and discussed based on the keywords using the log-likelihood ratio clustering algorithm. The analysis is further divided into three stages: namely, the initial stage (1991-2003), the rapid development stage (2004-2011), and the maturation stage (2012-present). These stages are used to present more fine-grained insights into the research patterns over time. We conclude by discussing implications of the bibliometric analysis and presenting several opportunities for future research.

AB  - Risks brought by climate change are inevitable obstacles to global development. Clarifying the features of climate change risks helps us to further understand and cope with climate change. There lacks a systematic review of climate change risks in terms of feature extraction and classification. The bibliometric analysis can be used to analyze and extract climate change risk features. The literature in the field of climate change was searched in the Web of Science database. Coauthors, citations, bibliographic coupling, co-citations, and keyword co-occurrence were analyzed. From five dimensions including nature, politics, economy, society, and culture, the risk features of climate change were extracted and summarized. Through text mining and cluster analysis, the climate change risk feature system was established, which is embodied in five different aspects: ecosystem and sustainability; uncertainty, vulnerability, and efficiency; behavior and decision-making; governance and management; and adaptation and mitigation. The feature system reflects that the current climate change risk presents strong variability and that the risk boundary is gradually blurred. The areas affected by risk are expanding and deepening. The strategies and governance for addressing risks are gradually diversified. This research contributes to the domain of climate change risk identification and assessment. The features of climate change indicate that we need to adjust policymaking and managerial practices for climate change in the future. Interdisciplinary cooperation, human cognition and preferences, public participation in global governance, and other unnatural factors related to climate change should be strengthened with a more positive attitude.

AB  - Research focusing on climate change and cultural heritage informs heritage management and policy. Fatoric and Seekamp assessed this field up to 2015, highlighting the need for periodic reassessment of the field given the observed growth and research that documents how cultural heritage contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Five years on, this systematic review reflects on the state of the art by evaluating 165 publications (2016-2020) about cultural heritage and climate change. We find the field continues to grow, and remains rich in disciplinary and methodological diversity, but predominantly represents research in and about Europe. The number of publications about integrating cultural heritage into adaptation and mitigation are increasing but remain relatively few compared to those about physical impacts on individual buildings or sites. The impact of climate change on intangible heritage has rarely been the sole focus of recent research. Although researchers are increasingly situating their research in a wider context of opportunities and barriers, vague timescales, and unspecific references to changes in the natural environment are additional limitations. This review also identified a lack of international collaboration, highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation and knowledge exchange on climate change and cultural heritage.

Even though over 90% of fatal road traffic injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) primarily affecting motorcyclists, the utility of helmet laws outside of high-income settings has not been well characterized. We sought to evaluate the differences in outcomes of mandatory motorcycle helmet legislation and determine whether these varied across country income levels.
   Methods and findings A systematic review and meta-analysis were completed using the PRISMA checklist. A search for relevant articles was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from January 1, 1990 to August 8, 2021. Studies were included if they evaluated helmet usage, mortality from motorcycle crash, or traumatic brain injury (TBI) incidence, with and without enactment of a mandatory helmet law as the intervention. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to rate study quality and funnel plots, and Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess for small study bias. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were stratified by high-income countries (HICs) versus LMICs using the random-effects model. Twenty-five articles were included in the final analysis encompassing a total study population of 31,949,418 people. There were 17 retrospective cohort studies, 2 prospective cohort studies, 1 case-control study, and 5 pre-post design studies. There were 16 studies from HICs and 9 from LMICs. The median NOS score was 6 with a range of 4 to 9. All studies demonstrated higher odds of helmet usage after implementation of helmet law; however, the results were statistically significantly greater in HICs (OR: 53.5; 95% CI: 28.4; 100.7) than in LMICs (OR: 4.82; 95% CI: 3.58; 6.49), p-value comparing both strata < 0.0001. There were significantly lower odds of motorcycle fatalities after enactment of helmet legislation (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61; 0.83) with no significant difference by income classification, p-value: 0.27. Odds of TBI were statistically significantly lower in HICs (OR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69) than in LMICs (0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.86) after enactment of law (p-value: 0.0001). Limitations of this study include variability in the methodologies and data sources in the studies included in the meta-analysis as well as the lack of available literature from the lowest income countries or from the African WHO region, in which helmet laws are least commonly present.
   Conclusions In this study, we observed that mandatory helmet laws had substantial public health benefits in all income contexts, but some outcomes were diminished in LMIC settings where additional measures such as public education and law enforcement might play critical roles.

AB  - With the advent of green chemistry, the use of enzymes in industrial processes serves as an alternative to the conventional chemical catalysts. A high demand for sustainable processes for catalysis has brought a significant attention to hunt for novel enzymes. Among various hydrolases, the alpha-amylase has a gamut of biotechnological applications owing to its pivotal role in starch-hydrolysis. Industrial demand requires enzymes with thermostability and to ameliorate this crucial property, various methods such as protein engineering, directed evolution and enzyme immobilisation strategies are devised. Besides the traditional culture-dependent approach, metagenome from uncultured bacteria serves as a bountiful resource for novel genes/biocatalysts. Exploring the extreme-niches metagenome, advancements in protein engineering and biotechnology tools encourage the mining of novel alpha-amylase and its stable variants to tap its robust biotechnological and industrial potential. This review outlines alpha-amylase and its genetics, its catalytic domain architecture and mechanism of action, and various molecular methods to ameliorate its production. It aims to impart understanding on mechanisms involved in thermostability of alpha-amylase, cover strategies to screen novel genes from futile habitats and some molecular methods to ameliorate its properties.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a pervasive and escalating global environmental problem, named among the most serious environmental issues globally, after climate change. A large percentage of the global plastic waste leakage is estimated to come from Asia, and most of this is from food and drink packaging. As a major user of single-use packaging, the food and beverage sector plays an important role in addressing plastic pollution, yet investigation of the uptake and transition to sustainable packaging by this industry sector remains limited. To contribute to filling this gap, a systematic review of 68 corporate sustainability reports was conducted to examine how major multinational companies in the food and beverage sector are addressing plastic pollution. This study focuses on how these companies address plastic pollution and packaging in their corporate sustainability reports, what sustainable packaging strategies they present, and how the companies address producer responsibility. The results show that the transition to sustainable packaging in the food and beverage sector is slow and inconsistent. Most corporate sustainability reports fail to address plastic pollution. There is a tendency for companies to report on collection and recycling, rather than sustainable packaging solutions aimed at systemic change. Producer responsibility concerning packaging is growing, however, most companies are doing very little to reduce plastic waste especially in regions lacking waste management infrastructure, such as those in emerging economies.

AB  - The unsustainable harvest of wildlife is a major threat to global biodiversity and to the millions of people who depend on wildlife for food and income. Past research has called attention to the fact that commonly used methods to evaluate the sustainability of wildlife hunting perform poorly, yet these methods remain in popular use today. Here, we conduct a systematic review of empirical sustainability assessments to quantify the use of sustainability indicators in the scientific literature and highlight associations between analytical methods and their outcomes. We find that indicator type, continent of study, species body mass, taxonomic group and socio-economic status of study site are important predictors of the probability of reported sustainability. The most common measures of sustainability include population growth models, the Robinson & Redford (1991) model and population trends through time. Indicators relying on population-specific biological data are most often used in North America and Europe, while cruder estimates are more often used in Africa, Latin America and Oceania. Our results highlight both the uncertainty and lack of uniformity in sustainability science. Given our urgent need to conserve both wildlife and the food security of rural peoples around the world, improvements in sustainability indicators are of utmost importance.

AB  - Objective: To influence the planning of the 2014 Commonwealth Games such that the positive impacts are maximized and the negative impacts are mitigated.
   Study design: Participatory health impact assessment (HIA).
   Methods: A participatory HIA was performed using standard World Health Organization methods. A scoping event was held to involve decision makers in the process and to identify the key areas for consideration. A large community engagement exercise and a systematic review were conducted as part of the evidence-gathering phase. The results of the HIA were reported to the key decision makers involved in the Glasgow City Council legacy strategy.
   Results: The likely net health impact of hosting the Commonwealth Games was uncertain. It was suggested that the main mechanisms through which impacts were likely to be felt were: the economy; civic pride; engagement in decision making; the provision of new infrastructure; and participation in cultural events. A series of recommendations was produced in order to maximize positive health benefits and mitigate negative impacts.
   Conclusions: HIA is a useful tool for engaging communities and decision makers in the public health agenda. HIAs of major multi-sport events are limited by a lack of quality evidence and the inability to predict impacts reliably. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, microalgae have received a lot of attention as an alternative feedstock for biofuel production due to numerous advantages such as fast growth rate, high lipid and carbohydrate content, and lack of competition with food production. However, one of the main barriers preventing the commercialization of biofuel production from microalgae is related to the supply chain management issues, and research efforts in the industry and academic communities have been put into this area to deliver solutions. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of studies in the context of the microalgae-to-biofuel supply chain to investigate problems that must be addressed to develop a reliable supply chain for real-world applications. Firstly, an introduction of biofuel production from microalgae and the general structure of the microalgae-based biofuel supply chain are presented. Secondly, decision-making levels in the microalgae biofuel supply chain along with associated supply chain decisions are discussed. Thirdly, the different sources of uncertainty that affect the performance of the supply chain as well as optimization approaches for dealing with uncertainty are reviewed. Finally, conclusions and directions for further research are outlined.

AB  - The European Green Deal with its high ambition has set the European Union (EU) on a promising path towards greater soil protection. The EU Soil Strategy 2030, the Biodiversity Strategy 2030, the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Zero Pollution, the Nature Restoration Law and the European Climate Law, among others, include actions to protect our soils. Research and Innovation (R&I) will play a key role in developing new knowledge and tools enabling the transition to healthy soils. The main aim of this paper is to analyse past and near-future trends in EU's funding for R&I on soil-related issues. For this purpose, a review of EU-funded soil projects was conducted based on the data available in the Community Research and Development Information Service and the official portal for European data. Our analysis shows that over the past 40 years, the EU has invested significantly in developing integrated knowledge about the relationships between soil functions and ecosystem services and how human-induced pressures affect soil health. Following the adoption of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy in 2006, there was an increase in research funding for soil-related research. Furthermore, our analysis also illustrates an interesting interplay of permanent and changing soil themes. The Horizon Europe Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', which aims to establish a network of 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils and safeguard human and planetary health by 2030, provides a further incentive for soil research. Together with the EU Soil Strategy 2030 and the new proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law), and the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the three instruments set up the political framework, concrete measures, and a monitoring system needed for the protection, restoration and sustainable use of soils.

AB  - The Furnariidae (Ovenbirds and Woodcreepers) are the most ecologically diverse family of passerines, occupying most terrestrial habitats across the Neotropics. Despite their high diversity, their diet is mainly composed of arthropods. Occasionally, furnariids consume fleshy fruits. However, the extent and drivers of frugivory in the Furnariidae remain poorly studied. We performed a systematic review on fruit consumption in the family and assessed whether frugivory was related to morphology (body mass, bill length, width and depth) and habitat type (forests, savannas, shrublands, grasslands, wetlands, rocky areas, coastlines, and artificial - terrestrial - landscapes) accounting for phylogenetic history among species and research effort (number of studies). We recorded 91 fruit-bird interactions between 33 bird and 38 plant species 10.8%, accounting for of the 304 species in the family). The probability of fruit consumption showed a strong phylogenetic signal, and was positively related to artificial landscapes, but not to morphology. Also, research effort largely explained variation in frugivory. Our results show that frugivory in the Furnariidae may be more common than previously thought, at least in certain genera (e.g. Asthenes, Pseudoseisura, Furnarius) and is partially explained by habitat type. The strong phylogenetic inertia in fruit consumption could be the result of physiological constraints linked to sugar metabolism, yet further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. It remains to be assessed the role of furnariids as effective seed dispersers in the light of fruit handling behaviour, gut passage and seed viability. If confirmed, seed dispersal by this group would represent an overlooked ecosystem service in the Neotropics.

AB  - Our climate is projected to change gradually over time. Mycotoxin occurrence in cereal grains is both directly and indirectly related to local weather and to climate changes. Direct routes are via the effects of precipitation, relative humidity, and temperatures on both fungal infection of the grain and mycotoxin formation. Indirect routes are via the effects of the wind dispersal of spores, insect attacks, and shifts in cereal grain phenology. This review aimed to investigate available modeling studies for climate change impacts on mycotoxins in cereal grains, and to identify how they can be used to safeguard food safety with future climate change. Using a systematic review approach, in total, 53 relevant papers from the period of 2005-2020 were retrieved. Only six of them focused on quantitative modeling of climate change impacts on mycotoxins, all in pre-harvest cereal grains. Although regional differences exist, the model results generally show an increase in mycotoxins in a changing climate. The models do not give an indication on how to adapt to climate change impacts. If available models were linked with land use and crop models, scenario analyses could be used for analyzing adaptation strategies to avoid high mycotoxin presence in cereal grains and to safeguard the safety of our feed and food.

AB  - Non-native tree plantations represent 7% of the world's forests and 1.24% of the Brazilian vegetation. Planted areas are expected to increase in the near future; thus, it is important to systematize existing knowledge on the ecological effects of plantations to aid forest management and biodiversity conservation. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the ecological literature associated with planted Pinus and Eucalyptus species in Brazil. We compared publication metrics with geographical distribution of species, ecosystems, biomes, studied taxa, and ecological impacts. We found 152 publications from 1992 to 2012. Number of publications positively correlated with area planted, number of plantations with forest certification, number of researchers, and richness of studied kingdoms. Most studies were in terrestrial ecosystems (92.1%), the Atlantic Forest biome (55.3%), and the kingdom Animalia (68.2%). Most impacts of non-native tree plantations were negative (55.9%), followed by positive (27%), and mixed (17.1%). Negative impacts were declines in species richness and abundance, seed bank diversity, and natural regeneration. Positive impacts were increase or mainteinance of seed bank diversity and natural regeneration. Mixed impacts were increases in abundance of native tree plantation pests. Taken together, results suggest forest management can help maintain biodiversity if it considers previous environmental conditions and integrates plantations with surrounding habitats.

AB  - Over the years, dry port studies experience a growing interest from academics and researchers focusing on various contexts within a seaport studies and involving a range of methods for evaluation and adoption. Some scholars have attempted to evaluate research in dry port during the past decade, but research involving structured analysis and extensive available literature are still very limited. Bibliometric analysis was conducted to generate 470 articles, and qualitative analysis was performed to produce 268 papers focusing on dry port studies from 1999 to 2019. The result categorize dry port studies into six thematic areas including (1) port policy and governance, (2) port management & strategies, (3) competition & performance, (4) planning & development, (5) dry port operation, and (6) spatial analysis. The finding of this study reveals that scholars are interested in competition, port performance, and dry port planning and development. On the other hand, the themes related to spatial analysis and dry port operation are found to remain limited. Moreover, sustainability issue has emerged as one of the potential topics that might highly contribute to the direction of future dry port studies.

AB  - The deployment of wind energy projects (WEP) within the process of energy transition changes energy landscapes and daily living environments. With regard to social acceptance as one social response towards WEP, the role of different aspects of justice (i.e. procedural, distributive, recognition) has been discussed. This study highlights the importance of social norms and their influence on perceived justice regarding WEP, which has been neglected in the literature so far. The relationship between social norms and perceived justice is explored as a conceptual framework through a systematic literature review and expert interviews. This framework aims to explain how social norms and their relationship with justice are defined, interlinked and how they affect perceptions of WEP. The results argue that social norms surface in situations where all the key elements of a project are decided without public impact. Thus, norms of fairness emerge under uncertain situations with the influence of similar emotions within groups. Moreover, social norms and perceived justice would explain several responses, such as local conflicts, or the motivation to further develop WEP. This study concludes by discussing the applicability of the framework, which needs further analysis as an analytical tool and deeper empirical investigation.

AB  - In construction engineering, there are many interactive and decision-making behaviors which could affect the progress and final performance. Based on the people-oriented concept, managing construction engineering should not ignore the understanding of individual behavior, and neuropsychology provides a refined microscopic perspective. This paper employed a bibliometric analysis of 1254 studies from the Web of Science related to behavioral research in construction engineering management using VOSviewer and summarized the neuropsychological mechanisms and research methods of behavior by systematic review. This paper found that: (1) Neuropsychological mechanisms of behavior include basic mechanisms about the brain and function and range from sensory to decision processes. Core factors are the functional ingredients. (2) Behavior research in construction engineering management is turning to neuropsychological experiments. Understanding the complex correlation mechanisms are the research trends in recent years. (3) Construction engineering management studies provide the means and methods to improve the validity and efficiency of management in the construction industry. The results confirm the impact of sensory perception on behavior and managerial performance. (4) The research trend in this field in the future is multidisciplinary. In total, this paper provides a potential effective reference for improving the performance of construction engineering management, developing sustainable construction production and consumption, and building a people-oriented livable city.

AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were used to assess the current state of knowledge and quantify the effects of land use change (LUC) to second generation (2G), non-food bioenergy crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of relevance to temperate zone agriculture. Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 +/- 7.8% and +25.7 +/- 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 +/- 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 +/- 4.3% and -11.4 +/- 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further longterm data sets are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The article proposes to construct and analyze the research landscape on the sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives' operations. The research was characterized as a systematic review of the literature, carried out through the ProKnow-C structured process, complemented by a procedure known as Snowball to form the portfolio of articles, theses and dissertations to be studied. The research results highlight models for the evaluation of the sustainability of agricultural cooperatives' operations that are still under construction. There are few studies that explain what a performance evaluation is, and there are no authors who have stood out in the research on this theme. Most sustainability assessment models for cooperatives do not address the three dimensions of sustainability in an integrated way, and the uniqueness of the decision maker is not proposed, since there is a predominance of Normativistic and Descriptive approaches. Mapping and organizing the body of knowledge on the theme of sustainability in agricultural cooperatives in the topic of performance evaluation is the main contribution of the article, since many previous studies did not address this. To that end, a conceptual map that outlines the thematic categories of sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives' operations was constructed, identifying where future research is needed, both for the construction of new theories and models and for the execution of empirical studies.

AB  - Conventional methodologies used to estimate biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems can be nonselective and invasive, sometimes leading to capture and potential injury of vulnerable species. Therefore, interest in noninvasive surveying techniques is growing among freshwater ecologists. Passive acoustic monitoring, the noninvasive recording of environmental sounds, has been shown to effectively survey biota in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, knowledge of the sounds produced by freshwater species is relatively scarce. Furthermore, little is known about the representation of different freshwater taxonomic groups and habitat types within the literature. Here we present results of a systematic review of research literature on freshwater bioacoustics and identify promising areas of future research. The review showed that fish are the focal taxonomic group in 44% of published studies and were studied primarily in laboratory aquaria and lotic habitats. By contrast, lentic habitats and other taxonomic groups have received relatively little research interest. It is particularly striking that arthropods are only represented by 26% of studies, despite their significant contributions to freshwater soundscapes. This indicates a mismatch between the representation of taxonomic groups within the freshwater bioacoustic literature and their relative acoustic contribution to natural freshwater soundscapes. In addition, the review indicates an ongoing shift from behavioral studies, often with focus on a single taxonomic group, towards field-based studies using ecoacoustic approaches. On the basis of this review we suggest that future freshwater bioacoustics research should focus on passive acoustic monitoring and arthropod sound, which would likely yield novel insights into freshwater ecosystem function and condition.

AB  - The international community's increasing attention to sport in policy decisions, along with growing programmatic and scholarship activity, demonstrate the need for data that facilitates evidence-informed decision making by organizations, policy actors, and funders within the Sport for Development (SfD) field. To achieve this, there is a need for effective and sustainable investment, resource mobilization, and funding streams that support meaningful and rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and research. In this paper, the SfD funding landscape as it pertains to monitoring, evaluation, and research is critically appraised by a diverse writing team. This appraisal is informed by our experiences as stakeholders, along with findings from two recent systematic reviews and knowledge accumulated from SfD literature. Various topics are discussed (e.g., intervention theories, external frameworks, targeted funding, collective impact, transparent funding climate), with the conclusion that all actors must support the pursuit of participatory, rigorous, process-centered (but outcome-aware) monitoring, evaluation, and research that aims to enhance our understanding of SfD. Ultimately, this monitoring, evaluation, and research should improve both policy and intervention design and implementation while also defining and testing more realistic, contextually relevant, culturally aware outcomes and impacts.

FX  - The systematic reviews were funded by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation USA. The focus on youth-focused SfD interventions within specific geographic locations for the systematic reviews was partially driven by these funders. The funders did not have any further role in the design of the systematic reviews nor in the systematic review procedures. However, representatives of two of the funders are coauthors on this paper and so assisted in the interpretation and writing for this specific paper.

AB  - Work psychosocial risk factors can be grouped into six dimensions: work intensity and time of work; emotional demands; lack of autonomy; ethical conflicts; poor social relationships and job and work insecurity. Although psychosocial risks are identified as a major challenge to the safety and health at work, it is relevant to question the weight, for health, of these risk factors and how to intervene to turn them into health and wellbeing enhancer factors. Thus, we present a research which includes a systematic review of such risks, the identification of the instruments used in their assessment and the outcomes they provide. Through this analysis, we found different approaches to address psychosocial risks, their assessment and theorization. We found the need for qualitative research that complement the repeated use of quantitative tools and enable greater wealth of data and a better approach to the reality of workers and avoid the social desirability effect. We also noted the need to find solutions for assessment and intervention, both individually and collectively. As a major implication, this research highlights the importance to study the factors underlying the psychosocial risks whose presence can be detected in a timely manner, as well as the creation of tools for intervention and transformation of working conditions.

AB  - Worker safety is a key concern in the construction industry. Making construction safer by reducing safety hazards is critical to sustainably developing the construction industry. Big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and other emerging information technologies are deeply integrated within the construction industry. The real-time monitoring of important physiological indicators of the physical state of construction workers is possible with the use of wearable sensing equipment and can pre-emptively give warning of safety hazards. Data mining and analysis of the monitoring data enable an assessment of the safety status of construction workers and can thus reduce potential hazards faced by construction workers on site. This study firstly reviewed the applications of common wearable devices in various industries, focusing on their use in construction safety. Then, CiteSpace 6.1 R4 software was used to visually analyze the literature data related to wearable devices in construction safety. Thirdly, a comprehensive review was conducted on the psychological state and safety evaluation methods of construction workers. Finally, several challenges and future research trends of wearable devices in the construction safety field were discussed. This paper has important theoretical value in advancing the field of construction safety risk management and improving risk control strategies.

AB  - ContextLandscape ecology is endowed with a wealth of accumulated insights into how spatial, ecological and social research can be fruitfully combined and synthesised. This has the potential to contribute significantly to how cultural landscapes are observed, analysed, conceptualised and explained.ObjectivesThis article provides an overview of theories in landscape ecology relevant to the study of cultural landscapes. Based on a review of selected contributions formulated since the field's first inception, it is outlined how theory was developed within the field and how proven methods of theory generation can inspire further development.MethodsA systematic review covering historical and contemporary theoretical contributions to landscape ecology was conducted. Theories were analysed to uncover by what methods they were formulated. On this basis, an overview of theories in landscape ecology relevant to the study of cultural landscapes was developed.ResultsA total of 32 theories were included in the review and described. Four pathways of theory development characteristic for the way knowledge is accumulated in landscape ecology were identified. These pathways exhibit modes of knowledge transfer between observations and actions taking place in concrete empirical contexts, knowledge which is transferable across contexts, as well as generally applicable concepts. An annotated overview of primary and secondary sources is provided. Contemporary literature building on the theories was identified, linking sources of conceptual inspiration to the current state of the art.ConclusionsThe review illustrates that a wealth of complementary theories exists in the field, creating a condition of theoretical multiplicity. Key theories and tendencies for theory development are outlined, and it is discussed how theoretical advancement in the study of cultural landscapes may be improved.

AB  - With the advancement of digital technologies, digital agriculture improves agricultural efficiency and sustainability, reducing resource waste and environmental burden. Hence, DA has emerged as a new catalyst for grain productivity and a driving force behind climate improvement, with broad prospects. However, digital agriculture is still in its early stage in most countries and there are few systematic reviews. In China, for example, there were only 3 non-core reviews out of 817 literatures on DA. Meanwhile, the use of Citespace is revolutionary as it leverages data visualization to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within literatures, aiding researchers in achieving their objectives. This study aims to address this research gap by using Citespace to produce a non-subjective and testable review on DA. In this study, we collected 2264 literatures by retrieving the WoS database in the timespan 1997-2022. The results show that 1) over time, the annual number of publications on DA has gradually increased and the research can be roughly divided into three stages: start-up, steady development, and rapid development stage; 2) research streams of DA can be further divided into six categories: Remote Sensing, Climate-Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data and System Integration; 3) development of research frontiers could be divided into three parts: "exploration of digital agriculture technologies," "operation management of digital agriculture" and "limitations of digital agriculture;" 4) future research should pay more attention to the innovation and scientific evaluation of digital technology and operation management. Also, effective DA policies should be put forward to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference.

AB  - Background
   Integration of HIV services with other health services has been proposed as an important strategy to boost the sustainability of the global HIV response. We conducted a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of the existing scientific evidence on the impact of service integration on the HIV care cascade, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.
   Methods and findings
   We reviewed the global quantitative empirical evidence on integration published between 1 January 2010 and 10 September 2021. We included experimental and observational studies that featured both an integration intervention and a comparator in our review. Of the 7,118 unique peer-reviewed English-language studies that our search algorithm identified, 114 met all of our selection criteria for data extraction. Most of the studies (90) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily in East Africa (55) and Southern Africa (24). The most common forms of integration were (i) HIV testing and counselling added to non-HIV services and (ii) non-HIV services added to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The most commonly integrated non-HIV services were maternal and child healthcare, tuberculosis testing and treatment, primary healthcare, family planning, and sexual and reproductive health services. Values for HIV care cascade outcomes tended to be better in integrated services: uptake of HIV testing and counselling (pooled risk ratio [RR] across 37 studies: 1.67 [95% CI 1.41-1.99], p < 0.001), ART initiation coverage (pooled RR across 19 studies: 1.42 [95% CI 1.16-1.75], p = 0.002), time until ART initiation (pooled RR across 5 studies: 0.45 [95% CI 0.20-1.00], p = 0.050), retention in HIV care (pooled RR across 19 studies: 1.68 [95% CI 1.05-2.69], p = 0.031), and viral suppression (pooled RR across 9 studies: 1.19 [95% CI 1.03-1.37], p = 0.025). Also, treatment success for non-HIV-related diseases and conditions and the uptake of non-HIV services were commonly higher in integrated services. We did not find any significant differences for the following outcomes in our meta-analyses: HIV testing yield, ART adherence, HIV-free survival among infants, and HIV and non-HIV mortality. We could not conduct meta-analyses for several outcomes (HIV infections averted, costs, and cost-effectiveness), because our systematic review did not identify sufficient poolable studies. Study limitations included possible publication bias of studies with significant or favourable findings and comparatively weak evidence from some world regions and on integration of services for key populations in the HIV response.
   Conclusions
   Integration of HIV services and other health services tends to improve health and health systems outcomes. Despite some scientific limitations, the global evidence shows that service integration can be a valuable strategy to boost the sustainability of the HIV response and contribute to the goal of 'ending AIDS by 2030', while simultaneously supporting progress towards universal health coverage.

AB  - With the evolving demand for sustainable mobility, adequate charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) has been growing steadily and wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has been seen as an efficient alternative for EV charging while maintaining seamless traffic flow. This paper reviews the modelling challenges in terms of both static (plug-in) charging (SC) and wireless charging (WC) facilities in a transportation network in terms of system integration, focusing on the evolution of the WPT technology. The first part of the paper provides an overview of all the major progress and achievements made by different research organisations in the area of WPT technology for EV charging. These technologies are ranked based on two indices, namely technological readiness level and system readiness level. The optimal location of WC facilities comes with more design and operational issues than conventional static charging facilities. However, they are similar in terms of the infrastructure modelling approach to locate these charging facilities, as the overall goal is to maximise the network flow and minimise the overall system cost. The second part of the paper assesses different modelling approaches used to analyse the network and locate the charging infrastructure for static and WC facilities. The economic feasibility of the technology is an important consideration for successful system integration as well as the overall performance of the system. As such, this paper also provides a synopsis of different socio-economic studies related to the WC infrastructure allocation problem. Finally, future research directions in this field are discussed based on the knowledge gaps identified from the existing literature.

AB  - Social considerations lie at the core of conservation challenges and are increasingly motivating researchers to seek methodological approaches that illuminate these social aspects in nuanced and actionable ways. Thus, theoretical approaches and methods from social science fields such as public health, education, and environmental justice may offer productive insights for the conservation endeavor. One approach long-used in these fields are Visual Participatory Methods (VPMs), which incorporate community-generated images as data. VPMs emphasize community perspectives by coalescing and representing data in ways that are authentic to and embedded in local context while facilitating flexibility in the research toolkit. Yet conservation research has underused VPMs, specifically with regard to people-centered approaches, which VPMs have the potential to help evolve beyond standing critiques toward more inclusive, equitable, and productive formulations. To understand how conservation researchers have employed VPMs to date-including key goals, findings, and outcomes-we conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. Through this process, our final sample identified 24 conservation-research studies that employed VPMs. Our review findings suggest that employing VPMs can lead to tangible conservation outcomes, and that they are useful to researchers across several dimensions: (1) understanding how residents' current perceptions of their social-ecological system have evolved over time, and how historical events have shaped them; (2) revealing residents' current perceptions of their surrounding environment, how they situate themselves within it, and how their values and worldviews may align or conflict with those of interacting institutions; and (3) uncovering potential avenues for reconciling those differences.

AB  - This study provides a systematic review of the literature on innovation research (IR) over the past two decades. We used data-driven approaches integrating network and natural language processing techniques on 41 inno-vation core and ancillary journals to characterize the IR landscape. Contrary to previous efforts, we explored knowledge in the whole IR field from general and specific patterns of growth and interaction using cluster-and term-based data and macro-and micro-level perspectives, respectively. Our results helped us uncover the changing features of the IR landscape in recent years: (i) a strong move into social-and sustainability-driven innovation; (ii) the merging of products and services into business model innovation; (iii) the more influential role of stakeholders such as the government and the general public; (iv) the use of global analytical perspectives while considering local contexts; (v) the importance of greater visions "pulling" innovation; (vi) the greater role of "soft" issues such as behaviors; and (vi) a shift into sectoral, geographical, and methodological diversification. Building on these aspects, we developed an emerging model for future innovation research and a series of IR propositions. Our findings help generate opportunities to build future innovation capabilities in research, practice, and education.

AB  - Agriculture in South Asia is vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, adaptation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, to reduce vulnerability, and to enhance the resilience of the agricultural system to climate change. There are many adaptation practices in the production systems that have been proposed and tested for minimizing the effects of climate change. Some socioeconomic and political setup contributes to adaptation, while others may inhibit it. This paper presents a systematic review of the impacts of climate change on crop production and also the major options in the agricultural sector that are available for adaptation to climate change. One of the key conclusions is that agricultural practices that help climate change adaptation in agriculture are available, while the institutional setup to implement and disseminate those technical solutions is yet to be strengthened. Thus, it is important to examine how to bring the required institutional change, generate fund to invest on these changes, and design dynamic policies for long-term climate change adaptation in agriculture rather than a mere focus on agricultural technology. This is one of the areas where South Asian climate policies require reconsidering to avoid possible maladaptation in the long run.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are recognised as one of the nature-based solutions to a changing climate. Notwithstanding the socio-ecological benefits of mangrove ecosystems, they are increasingly being destructed in some regions of the world. In Ghana, several studies have reported on the status, use, and management strategies of mangrove ecosystems in different sites of the country. However, these studies do not make it possible to appreciate the broader picture of Ghana's mangrove ecosystems since they are not synthesized into a single comprehensive report. This study uses the ROSES method for systematic reviews to report on Ghana's mangrove ecosystem distribution and species composition, as well as their socio-economic benefits, the anthropogenic and natural impacts on Ghana's mangrove ecosystems, and the management strategies and/or practices on Ghana's mangrove ecosystems. The study reveals there is no existing management strategy for Ghana's mangrove ecosystems, and therefore recommends the need to develop and implement policies and regulations that specifically target the protection and sustainable use of mangrove ecosystems in Ghana.

AB  - High-speed railway is trending in developing countries for economic reasons, mobility in the aftermath of COVID-19, and environmental concerns. The high-speed railway operators continuously improve the operational speed to transport more passengers in less time. However, increasing the train loads at high speed might increase the dynamic loads of bridges and affect their pile foundation. A stiffer railway bridge is mandatory for high-speed train safety and passenger riding comfort. However, a flexible bridge is ideal for responding to earthquakes. Thus, these two objectives are conflicting. This review paper provides a bibliometric review aiming to determine the published studies by year and by country, and to visualize different research trends in cluster maps using the VOSviewer software, summarizing the published research for high-speed railway bridges starting from 1964. The review also extracted information from the latest studies by summarizing some essential objectives, useful methodologies, and notable findings that might be applicable to future studies. In conclusion, there is a need for further research to fill the knowledge gap in the study related to the soil-structure interaction phenomenon considering the performance-based seismic design of a high-speed railway bridge on a monopile foundation in the event of lateral spreading due to soil liquefaction.

AB  - The global challenges of sustainability are transforming the economy of the 21st Century. Economic, social, and environmental sustainability impacts regulators and businesses, particularly in the aviation industry, and facilitates access to productive services and market linkages. Airport stakeholders are increasingly pressuring companies to consider their socioeconomic impacts and manage them sustainably and resiliently. Business is paramount to airport companies in this competitive and economically sensitive climate. Many studies have addressed the issue of airport sustainability from specific perspectives. These perspectives include economic sustainability, benefits related to economic and environmental sustainability, and the impact of operations on the airport environment. This report summarises the current state of airport environmental sustainability practices, including greenhouse gas emissions from airport pavements, energy management strategies for airport buildings and operations, water conservation, and waste management. We aim to provide a clear and integrative picture of these impacts on airport sustainability through a systematic literature review while advancing knowledge A systematic literature review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. This systematic literature review sought to consolidate knowledge on the subject. In order to illustrate the link between major categories and their corresponding trends, authors used VOSviewer scientific software. The compilation of existing knowledge on the three components of sustainability likely underscores the importance of overall airport sustainability. It is suggested that further studies be conducted.

AB  - The transition from linear economy into circular economy is not realizable until circular economy principles are applied into the life-cycle stages of buildings which is a proactive design approach to manage buildings from cradle to cradle. Resources are depleted without any effective programme for material recovering. Hence, this study was aimed at identifying suggested advancements for the application of circular economy principles in buildings. The study objectives were to systematically review/analyse proposed circular economy interventions in buildings and finally conclude on findings whilst identifying research gaps. Therefore, the study gathered related articles for review under seven identified major circular economy strategies. Results revealed that there was a progressive awareness/research on circularity in buildings although its awareness/acceptance were still at their infancy. Sixty-four articles were analysed under identified strategies, leading to discussion of major interventions. The review revealed practical approaches to the application of circular economy in buildings, also identifying aspects that received little attention, including research-gaps. It was recommended that future research should focus on obscured areas identified for a holistic approach. Conclusions were deducted from the analysis and recommendations made based on researchers work on the susceptibility of buildings to resource efficiency in a circular economy.

AB  - Over the past decade, research on the impacts of climate change on immovable cultural heritage (ICH) in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctica) has slowly increased. This article offers a systematic review and synthesis of the publications about climate change impacts on the diverse ICH and climate change adaptation in the polar regions. Gray literature was not included in the study. Arctic countries like Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and Russia, and their associated research organizations, are under-represented in this literature when compared with the USA, Canada, Denmark, and Norway. More than half of the analyzed literature is published in the last 3 years (2019, 2020, and 2021) with a focus on coastal erosion and ICH degradation (cryospheric hazards). ICH is at risk from biological degradation, coastal erosion, debris flow, and thaw slumping. Nearly half of the studies report on the need for climate change adaptation planning and implementation for ICH. This study shows that advances in research on climate change impacts and adaptation responses are needed to improve decision- and policy-maker capacity to support effective adaptation policies and to contribute to the achievement of SDGs in polar regions. The polar regions' vulnerable landscapes and ICH sites can be used to communicate a larger message about the climate change challenges and adaptation measures.This article is categorized under:Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Observed Impacts of Climate ChangeVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and AnalogiesClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well-Being

AB  - The ever-increasing number of accidents is detrimental to the sustainable objectives of work zones. Exploring the causes for work zone safety (WZS) issues, countermeasures, and effectiveness is significant to enhance the WZS. Therefore, this research aims to identify the factors influencing the WZS, identify the established countermeasures, examine the effectiveness of countermeasures, and develop a decision support framework to enhance WZS. This study addresses the issue by utilizing the Scopus database and the VOSViewer data mining tool. A Bibliometric search followed by a Scientometric analysis was conducted to identify the highly researched areas. Qualitative content analysis was performed by exploiting the results, findings, and discussions from influential articles. A systematic coding process was carried out by employing Nvivo software to establish factors that influence the WZS and possible countermeasures. The most influencing factors were driver speeding, inattention, non-compliance to traffic control measures, poor work zone (WZ) layout, lane closures, and adverse weather conditions. Highly discussed countermeasures include changeable/variable/dynamic message signs, advance traveler information systems (ATIS), channelizing devices, merge guidance and police enforcement presence. Further, a framework to support WZS decision-making is developed to assist industry practitioners in making informed decisions on WZS. The academic community can benefit from identifying the core literature related to urban WZS and knowledge gaps that need to address in the future.

AB  - Plain Language Summary In Ethiopia, married girls are a particularly vulnerable adolescent population because of the many health risks associated with early marriage. Peer-based approaches are a common strategy to improve sexual and reproductive health knowledge and behaviours for marginalized groups. Critiques of these approaches are that they lack sustainability without ongoing investment and have no lasting impact on health behaviours. CARE's TESFA programme, a peer-based approach with married adolescent girls in South Gondar, was found to be effective in creating long-term behavior change related to uptake of family planning and rates of institutional delivery. Some 88% of groups who received the TESFA curriculum were still meeting 4 years after the programme had concluded. Some participants even created groups of their own, scaling TESFA beyond the original audience, suggesting a potential approach to wider scale-up. To explore lessons learned around scale and sustainability, this study interviewed TESFA participants and stakeholders. Improvements in behaviours related to contraceptive use, institutional delivery, and girls' agency in reproductive decision-making were sustained over time regardless of group status. Factors that affected the sustainability and scale-up of groups included solidarity among group members, support from husbands and community members, ongoing savings and loan structures, flexibility of group processes, and availability of relevant curriculum topics. Through an analysis of these findings, this paper discusses recommendations for sustainable and scalable peer-based programme design via existing Ethiopian community structures. Using TESFA principles as a model, practitioners could design and implement scalable and sustainable peer-based programming for adolescents sexual and reproductive health.
   Background Girls in Ethiopia's Amhara region experience high rates of child marriage and are less able to negotiate sex or use family planning. Seeking to improve their lives, CARE's TESFA programme delivered reproductive health and financial savings curricula to married girls via reflective dialogues in peer-based solidarity groups. From 2010 to 2013, 5,000 adolescent girls participated via three intervention arms: sexual and reproductive health, economic empowerment, and a combination of both. At end-line, participants reported improvements across health and empowerment outcomes. Four years post-TESFA, 88% of groups reported meeting without continued assistance from CARE. Some original participants had created new groups based on the TESFA model, and some girls not recruited for TESFA spontaneously replicated it to create their own groups. However, questions remained about what had contributed to this organic sustainment and scale-up of groups. Methods This 2018 study investigated factors affecting sustainability and scale-up of peer solidarity groups through a systematic mapping of TESFA groups across five woredas (districts) and interviews with key stakeholders. Data were collected from 39 focus groups with active and dissolved Girl Groups, Social Analysis and Action groups, and girls' husbands and from 29 in-depth interviews with group facilitators and community health workers across three districts. Data were coded and analyzed per grounded theory principles. Results Changes in reproductive health knowledge and specific behaviours, such as contraceptive use and institutional delivery, were maintained 5 years after the intervention ended. Group connectedness, spousal support, integration of holistic community platforms, and opportunities for financial independence were found to be important for group sustainability. Observed changes in TESFA girls' confidence to negotiate and assert their rights, hopes of improved mobility, and the promise of economic opportunity commonly inspired spontaneous replication of groups. Recommendations for future peer-based programmes include creating environments of solidarity and holistically engaging intervention communities. Conclusion By increasing knowledge of and access to reproductive health services, TESFA mitigates some of the harmful effects of child marriage. The maintenance and organic replication of groups suggest that TESFA provides a successful, scalable and sustainable tested model for reproductive health program delivery through peer-based solidarity groups.

AB  - Hydroponics is a modern cultivation technique that utilizes nutrient solutions instead of soil for crop production. Currently, challenges, such as high cost, high energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and significant wastewater generation are drawbacks that limit its scale up. On the other hand, bioelectrochemical systems have emerged as a sustainable technology that resolve some of the aforementioned drawbacks, albeit in other sce-narios. Bioelectrochemical systems applications are well documented in desalination, metal recovery, energy generation, contamination remediation etc. This work conceptualizes the integration of bioelectrochemical systems and hydroponics with a view to improving the efficiency and sustainability of hydroponics. Firstly, a systematic review of the main challenges hindering hydroponic agriculture development is first carried out to identify possible entry points for the proposed systems integration. Thereafter, a conceptualized point-by-point resolution of the main identified challenges of hydroponic systems through bioelectrochemical systems inte-gration is explored. Furthermore, the feasibility, stability, and scalability of the conceptualized hydroponic-bioelectrochemical integrated systems are discussed.

AB  - Living labs (LLs) have emerged as an interface for higher education institutions to collaborate with companies, citizens, non-profit and government organizations to address a variety of problems around social challenges and sustainable development. In this systematic literature review, we summarize the existing knowledge on how universities shape and manage the LLs they are associated with and how they align with their core missions of education and research and-in particular-their social missions. Following PRISMA guidelines for a systematic literature review (SLR), we analyzed journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters published between 2008 and 2020, capturing 93 university-governed LL experiences from across the world. Our findings show that LLs are developing from bottom-up initiatives, often at the fringe of higher education institutions, towards more self-standing entities implementing strategies to undertake social outreach activities. LLs require their host universities to intensify the relationships with their stakeholders and work on capacity building and focus on inter- and transdisciplinary research methodologies. Finally, our literature review points to the need for further research on the hybrid governance approaches displayed by LLs, particularly looking at the roles and responsibilities of academics involved in managing LL initiatives.

AB  - Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are transforming rapidly due to changes in multiple environmental and socioeconomic drivers. However, the complexity and diversity of MtSES present challenges for local communities, researchers and decision makers seeking to anticipate change and promote action towards sustainable MtSES. Participatory scenario planning can reveal potential futures and their interacting dynamics, while archetype analysis aggregates insights from site-based scenarios. We combined a systematic review of the global MtSES participatory scenarios literature and archetype analysis to identify emergent MtSES archetypal configurations. An initial sample of 1983 rendered 42 articles that contained 142 scenarios within which were 852 'futures states'. From these future states within the scenarios, we identified 59 desirable and undesirable futures that were common across studies. These 'common futures' were grouped into four clusters that correlated significantly with three social-ecological factors (GDP per capita, income inequality, and mean annual temperature). Using these clusters and their associated significant factors, we derived four MtSES scenario archetypal configurations characterized by similar key adaptation strategies, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. We called these archetypes: (1) "revitalization through effective institutions and tourism"; (2) "local innovations in smallholder farming and forestry"; (3) "upland depopulation and increased risk of hazards"; and (4) "regulated economic and ecological prosperity". Results indicate risks to be mitigated, including biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, cultural heritage change, loss of connection to the land, weak leadership, market collapse, upland depopulation, increased landslides, avalanches, mudflows and rock falls, as well as climate variability and change. Transformative opportunities lie in adaptive biodiversity conservation, income diversification, adaptation to market fluxes, improving transport and irrigation infrastructure, high quality tourism and preserving traditional knowledge. Despite the uncertainties arising from global environmental changes, these archetypes support better targeting of evidence-informed actions across scales and sectors in MtSES.

AB  - Current research largely focuses on the role of allotment gardens, the challenges facing them, and the direction of their future development in urban environments. The main idea behind the introduction of allotment gardens was to improve the living conditions and food supply of workers and the underprivileged. The impact of allotment gardening does not only concern the allotment gardeners but also the general public and the environment. It is important to emphasise that allotments have impacts not only on food production and outdoor physical activity, but also on the reuse of idle or neglected land, community development, therapeutic and nutritional benefits, and psychological benefits for allotment holders and residents. For this reason, this study captures six broad themes related to allotments: (1) community participation and cohesion, (2) health and well-being, (3) economic opportunities, (4) pollution, (5) urban planning and development, and (6) sustainable environment. The research is a systematic review in which steps were taken to minimise bias in the identification, selection, and summarisation of studies. The initial literature selection was based on a keyword search (title, abstract, and keywords) of the comprehensive literature databases Web of Science (all years) and Scopus (all years). The total scientific literature on which this review is based includes 162 research articles published between 1978 and July 2022. This work aims to fill these gaps and analyse existing knowledge by providing a detailed review of the academic literature, focusing not only on the benefits of community gardens and allotments in urban areas, but also on the existing problems related to allotments and urban gardening. Possible directions of development are also analysed based on the legal regulations in each country.

AB  - Electrically conductive asphalt concrete (ECAC) is an innovative material that offers numerous possibilities by directly incorporating functional additives (such as metal-based or carbon-based materials) into asphalt binder and mixing it with traditional aggregates and mineral filler. With such a strategy, ECAC possesses a high electrical/thermal conductivity, making it an ideal candidate for sustainable repair methods based on induced heating-healing, snow and ice melting systems on pavements, and piezoresistive sensors for traffic detection in pavement engineering. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the design and development of ECAC, with a particular focus on the advancements made over the past decade (from 2013 to 2023). The review begins by introducing the composition and fundamental principles underlying ECAC. Subsequently, it summarizes the key aspects related to the design and preparation of ECAC. Moreover, this paper delves into the remarkable multi-functionality exhibited by ECAC, showcasing its potential in practical applications. Through examining various case studies, the review highlights the successful utilization of ECAC in diverse scenarios. This review work can serve as a valuable resource, offering insights and guidance for developing ECAC in the context of smart and sustainable pavement construction.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of MCDM techniques and approaches in sustainable and renewable energy systems problems. This study reviewed a total of 54 papers published from 2003-2015 in more than 20 high-ranking journals, most related to sustainable and renewable energies, and which were extracted from the Web of Science database. In the category of application areas, papers were classified into two main groups: (1) sustainable energy and (2) renewable energy. Furthermore, in the classification of techniques and approaches, the papers were categorized into six groups: (1) AHP and F-AHP; (2) ANP and VIKOR; (3) TOPSIS and F-TOPSIS; (4) PROMETHEE; (5) integrated methods and (6) other methods. In addition, papers were reviewed based on the authors' nationalities, the publication date, techniques and approaches, the name of journal and studies criteria. The results of this study indicated that, in 2015, scholars have published more papers than in other years. Furthermore, AHP/fuzzy AHP and integrated methods were ranked as the first rank, with 14 papers. Additionally, Journal of Renewable Energy is the first journal, with 16 publications, and this was the most significant journal in this study. Findings of this review paper confirm that MCDM techniques can assist stakeholders and decision makers in unravelling some of the uncertainties inherent in environmental decision making, and these techniques demonstrate a growing interest of previous scholars to apply these techniques for solving different stages of sustainable and renewable energy systems.

AB  - The smart city thought alludes to better of organising city functions and urban life, which are accepted to move production and consumption from worldwide to local, manufacturing from competitive to collaborative, and business from stakeholders to a customer point of view. Policy makers have addressed the need for sustainable development and increasing urban population density in part by using smart city theory and practices. Current smart city frameworks are best categorized as descriptive theories. There has been a gap in the literature regarding smart cities. Most past research has focussed on the societal level of smart cities, while less appears to be recognised about the management of business as part of smart cities. The determination of this paper is to present a systematic review on the state of the art of management research on smart cities. A total of 20 papers which based on midsized smart-designated cities have been discussed. Those research papers mostly collected data from government websites and city manager surveys. This paper emphasised on the policy and societal level issues which create hurdles in developing smart cities. The review on the literature of smart city framework creates the roadmap for the use in both future research and for cities planners to advance smart city development and to act as responsible stewards for stakeholders who rely on researcher's directions.

AB  - Background: Today, with the growing interest of the medical community and others in practice guidelines, there is greater emphasis on formal procedures and methods for arriving at a widely scrutinized and endorsed consensus than ever before. Conflicts in terminology and technique are notable for the confusion that guidelines create and for what they reflect about differences in values experiences, and interests among different parties. While public and private development activities continue to multiply, the means for coordinating these efforts to resolve inconsistencies, fill in gaps, track applications and results, and asses, the soundness of particular guidelines continue to be limited.
   In this era of widespread guideline development by private organizations, the American College of Occupational and Environment Medicine (ACOEM) has developed guidelines that evaluate areas of clinical practice well beyond the scope of occupational medicine and yet fail to properly involve physicians expert in these, especially those in the field of interventional pain management. As the field of guidelines suffers from imperfect and incomplete scientific knowledge as well as imperfect and uneven means of applying that knowledge without a single or correct way to develop guidelines, ACOEM guidelines have been alleged to hinder patient care, reduce access to interventional pain management procedures, and transfer patients into a system of disability, Medicare, and Medicaid.
   Objective: To critically appraise occupational medicine practice guidelines for interventional pain management by an independent review utilizing the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE), American Medical Association (AMA), Institute of Medicine (IOM), and other commonly utilized criteria.
   Methods: Revised chapters of ACOEM guidelines, low back pain and chronic pain, developed in 2007 and 2008 are evaluated, utilizing AGREE, AMA, IOM instruments, and Shaneyfelt et al's criteria, were independently reviewed by 4 appraisers.
   Results: Critical appraisal utilizing the AGREE instrument found that both chapters scored less than 10% in 3 of the 6 contains, less than 20% in one domain, over 30% in one domain, and over 70% in one domain. Global assessment also scored below 30% with a recommendation from AGREE, "not recommended or suitable for use in practice."
   Based on AMA key attributes, both chapters of ACOEM guidelines met only one of the 6 key attributes, only 3 of the 8 attributes were met by IOM criteria, and based on the criteria described by Shaneyfelt et al, overall only 28% of criteria were met.
   Conclusion: Both the low back pain and chronic pain chapters of the ACOEM guidelines may not be ideal for clinical use based on the assessment by the AGREE instrument, AMA attributes, and criteria established by Shaneyfelt et al. They also scored low on IOM criteria (37.5%). These guidelines may not be applicable for clinical use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the ability of the health and self-management in diabetes questionnaire (HASMID-10) to verify the impact of self-management on diabetes, we highlight its relevance to scientific research and clinical applicability. However, to date, no study has been conducted to scientifically support its use in other languages.OBJECTIVE: To translate, cross-culturally adapt, and validate the HASMID-10 into the Brazilian Portuguese. DESIGN AND SETTING: A translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation study conducted at Ce-uma University.METHODS: Study was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Process of Cross-Cultural Adap-tation of Self-Report Measures and Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement In-struments. We included participants of both sexes diagnosed with diabetes, aged between 18 and 64 years, and without cognitive deficits or any other limitations that would prevent them from answering the ques-tionnaire. We assessed participants using the problem areas in diabetes (PAID) scale and HASMID-10. We as-sessed reliability using a test-retest model with a 7-day interval between assessments. We used intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 95% confidence interval (CI), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimum detectable difference (MDD), Spearman correlation coefficient, and floor and ceiling effects.RESULTS: Sample comprised 116 participants, most of whom were women, overweight, non-practitioners of physical activity, and nonsmokers. We observed significant correlations (P = 0.006; rho =-0.256) be-tween the HASMID-10 and PAID, adequate reliability (ICC = 0.780) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.796). No ceiling or floor effects were observed.CONCLUSION: HASMID-10 has adequate measurement properties and may be used for Brazilians.

AB  - Since Chinese scholars are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the national landscape of discussion on AI ethics, understanding their ethical concerns and preferred solutions is essential for global cooperation on governance of AI. This article, therefore, provides the first elaborated analysis on the discourse on AI ethics in Chinese academia, via a systematic literature review. This article has three main objectives. (1) to identify the most discussed ethical issues of AI in Chinese academia and those being left out (the question of "what"); (2) to analyze the solutions proposed and preferred by Chinese scholars (the question of "how"); and (3) to map out whose voices are dominating and whose are in the marginal (the question of "who"). Findings suggest that in terms of short-term implications, Chinese scholars' concerns over AI resemble predominantly the content of international ethical guidelines. Yet in terms of long-term implications, there are some significant differences needed to be further addressed in a cultural context. Further, among a wide range of solution proposals, Chinese scholars seem to prefer strong-binding regulations to those weak ethical guidelines. In addition, this article also found that the Chinese academic discourse was dominated by male scholars and those who are from elite universities, which arguably is not a unique phenomenon in China.

AB  - Urbanization and rising populations are contributing significantly to the problem of garbage generation in cities. For a quite long time, big cities all around the world have been particularly concerned about rising waste. For countries with inadequate waste management procedures and faster-rising garbage volumes, this is a severe problem. Many of the waste management systems in use in cities today do not come with features like operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance. The way solid waste is managed has evolved as a result of the Internet of Things, Global Positioning System, and cloud computing methods. The research community has also developed numerous waste management methods based on the Internet of Things and blockchain, and machine learning. Using the method of a systematic literature review, this research examines several waste management approaches. Based on the considered 178 research papers, this paper provides the opportunities brought about by the Internet of Things, machine learning, Global Positioning System, and Blockchain in various waste management techniques, their application scenarios, real-time tracing and tracking of waste, reliable channelization and compliance with waste treatment, efficient waste resource management, protection of waste management documentation, and fleet management. Based on the conducted review, this paper presents open challenges associated with waste management techniques that act as future research directions. Waste bin placement and its security, internet connectivity with waste management components, transportation of waste, and waste disposal techniques are the main categories of challenges associated with waste management. This paper also provides a comparison of the presented review with other published review papers.

AB  - Agricultural production systems are a composite of philosophy, adoptability, and careful analysis of risks and rewards. The two dominant typologies include conventional and organics, while biotechnology (GM) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) represent situational modifiers. We conducted a systematic review to weigh the economic merits-as well as intangibles through an economic lens-of each standalone system and system plus modifier, where applicable. Overall, 17,485 articles were found between ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, with 213 initially screened based on putative relevance. Of those, 82 were selected for an in-depth analysis, with 63 ultimately used. Economically, organic generally outperformed conventional systems. This is largely due to their lower production costs and higher market price. However, organic farms face lower yields, especially in the fruit, vegetable, and animal husbandry sectors. With that said, organic farming can provide significant local environmental benefits. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a potentiator of either core system. As a risk reduction and decision-making framework, it is labor intensive. However, this can be offset by input reductions without yield penalty compared to a conventional baseline. Biotechnology is a rapidly emerging production system, notably in developing countries. The use of GM crops results in lower production cost and higher yields. As a conventional modifier, its major advantage is scale-neutrality. Thus, smaller and lower income farmers may achieve higher gross margin. The main source of environmental benefits is reduced pesticide use, which implies a decreased need for fuel and labor. Barring external influences such as subsidies and participation in prescriptive labeling programs, farmers should focus on an a la carte approach (as opposed to discrete system adoption) to optimize their respective enterprises.

AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) framework has been widely applied to generate LCZ maps for understanding urban thermal environments. LCZ mapping has two research streams. The remote sensing stream has developed rapidly through organized effort. By contrast, the geographic information system (GIS) stream is characterized by slow progress through individual explorations. Major obstacles in the GIS stream include two key issues in implementing the original LCZ framework: lack of data and unclear method specifications. Further development in this stream requires a comprehensive summary of previous studies and their diverse methods to improve understanding and address the aforementioned issues. The current work aims to fill this research gap by systematically reviewing 16 GIS-based LCZ mapping works that represent 24 important studies in the field. This review summarizes a general LCZ mapping process from the reviewed studies. The process has six steps: data collection, basic spatial unit definition, urban canopy parameter calculation, LCZ classification, post-processing, and performance evaluation. Diverse methods are examined and compared in each step, and major challenges and new opportunities are identified from these studies. This review provides a clear depiction of the GIS stream and suggests collaborations among stakeholders to contribute to the further development of this stream and discusses the implication of this technique in urban planning and policy making to facilitate sustainable urban development.

AB  - The controversies surrounding Bitcoin, one of the most frequently used and advertised cryptocurrency, are focused on identifying its qualities, the advantages and disadvantages of using it and, last but not least, its ability to survive over time and become a viable alternative to the traditional currency, taking into account the effects on the environment of the technology used to extract and trade it. Based on such considerations, this article aims to provide an overview of this cryptocurrency, from the perspective of conducting a systematic review of the literature dedicated to the economic and environmental impact of Bitcoin. Using peer-reviewed articles collected from academic databases, we aimed at synthesizing and critically evaluating the points of view in the scientific literature regarding the doctrinal source of the emergence of Bitcoin, the identity of this cryptocurrency from an economic point of view, following its implications on the economic and social environment. Subsequently, this research offers the opportunity of evaluating the level of knowledge considering the impact of Bitcoin mining process on the environment from the perspective of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in order to finally analyze Bitcoin regulation and identify possible solutions to reduce the negative impact on the environment and beyond. The findings suggest that, despite high energy consumption and adverse environmental impact, Bitcoin continues to be an instrument used in the economic environment for a variety of purposes. Moreover, the trend of regulating it in various countries shows that the use of Bitcoin is beginning to gain some legitimacy, despite criticism against this cryptocurrency.

AB  - The recent extreme volatility in agriculture prices determines serious repercussions to various stakeholders and levels in the food value chain, that is, producers, intermediaries, and customers, at micro-, meso- and macro-economic governance levels, respectively. Persistent high/low degree of agriculture prices leads to unsustainable production/consumption patterns, thus representing an impediment to reaching the goal of responsible consumption and production (UN-SDGs 12). The lack of comprehensive real-time information on price volatility's internal and external factors often resulted in an inconclusive and counterintuitive outcome while performing empirical estimation. The present review was conducted using the PRISMA framework to systematically identify and analyze literature from two important databases. Papers have been grouped by volatility drivers, governance levels, theoretical approaches, and background data types. The present review is a valuable starting point for understanding the links between multi-dimensional factors affecting the persistent price volatility and the theoretical and empirical analytics trends to provide the computational advancement needed to cope with model estimation issues. It also highlights the importance of a paradigm shift in researching agriculture price volatility to addressing food crises, considering principal objectives and perspectives such as food security, poverty alleviation, sustainability in food value chains, and resilience of food systems across the globe.

AB  - Thermal power plants (TPPs) are critical to supplying energy to society, and ensuring their safe and efficient operation is a top priority. To minimize maintenance shutdowns and costs, modern TPPs have adopted advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques. These FDD approaches can be divided into three main categories: model-based, data-driven-based, and statistical-based methods. Despite the practical limitations of model-based methods, a multitude of data-driven and statistical techniques have been developed to monitor key equipment in TPPs. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic review of advanced FDD methods that addresses a literature gap by providing a comprehensive comparison and analysis of these techniques. The review discusses the most relevant FDD strategies, including model-based, data-driven, and statistical-based approaches, and their applications in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of TPPs. Our review highlights the novel and innovative aspects of these techniques and emphasizes their significance in sustainable energy development and the long-term viability of thermal power generation. This review further explores the recent advancements in intelligent FDD techniques for boilers and turbines in TPPs. It also discusses real-world applications, and analyzes the limitations and challenges of current approaches. The paper highlights the need for further research and development in this field, and outlines potential future directions to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of intelligent TPPs. Overall, this review provides valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art in FDD techniques for TPPs, and serves as a guide for future research and development.

AB  - The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the main topics debated in ecology. Amphibians are highly sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation, due to their traits and reproductive requirements. In the present study, we developed a meta-analysis to address a mean effect size to SAR regarding forest amphibians in man-made fragmented landscapes, and tested the influence of seven in-study and landscape variables that may affect this relationship globally. We conducted a search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol and calculated an effect size for each one of the 28 studies elected by our criteria. There is a positive relationship between amphibia richness and patch area, with a mean effect size of 0.68 and high heterogeneity among studies. The meta-regressions showed that only the matrix type surrounding the patches affected the variance between studies, explaining 46%. Clear cut was the matrix with the highest effect size, followed by silviculture, but both had a low representation of studies. Agriculture, grazing and urban matrices had a significant influence on patch area and the species richness relationship, but with distinct mean effects sizes and variances between-studies. The matrix type around the remnants may substantially affect results and interpretation of the SAR, possibly due to the varying capacity of amphibia species to cross and inhabit each matrix type. If possible, SAR should be compared within a context of multiple landscapes, and not only with a patch-focused and local approach.

AB  - Light pollution affects seabirds through the attraction to light sources and its fallout all over the world, being petrels and shear-waters the most affected species. Light pollution is increasing globally and its effects on seabirds will likely increase during the next years. A global assessment of this issue has been made, but there is no detailed information about South America; thus, the aim of this article is to assess the situation in Chile, in order to suggest technical measures to be considered into the national light pollution policy, which could promote the addressing of the issue in South America. To do so, a diagnosis on marine bird species was made through direct consultation with experts, a systematic review, and research in free access databases. We found 17 seabirds species affected by fallout in Chile, including six species not previously recognized in the literature. The impact is mainly distributed in islands and coastal localities, but also inland, as far as 100 km from the shore. Most of the management of this phenomenon done in Chile is restricted to the rescue and release of affected birds, although there is no evidence of the long-term success of this approach. Measures, such as turning off lights or light replacement are rare, implemented at a small scale, and have unknown results. An update of the light pollution policy is required in Chile, which should consider the protection of biodiversity as a goal, the national geographic scope beyond areas of astronomical interest, and including new lighting technologies such as LED lights. Finally, the development of stronger regulations for human activities, like lighting near sensible points, including seabirds' breeding grounds, is especially important.

AB  - Background:Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) with subsequent cholecystectomy is the standard of care for the management of patients with choledocholithiasis. There is conflicting evidence in terms of mortality reduction, prevention of complications specifically biliary pancreatitis and cholangitis with the use of early cholecystectomy particularly in high-risk surgical and elderly patients.Aims:We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the early cholecystectomy versus wait and watch strategy after ES.Methods:We searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane database for randomized controlled trials comparing the 2 strategies in the management of choledocholithiasis after ES. Our primary outcome of interest was difference in mortality. We evaluated several secondary outcomes including difference in development of acute pancreatitis, biliary colic and cholecystitis, cholangitis and recurrent jaundice, nonbiliary adverse events, and length of hospital stay. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for categorical variables and difference in means was calculated for continuous variables. These were pooled using random effects model.Results:Seven studies with 916 patients (455 cholecystectomy group and 461 wait and watch group) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled RR with 95% confidence interval for mortality was 1.43 (0.93-2.18), I-2=9%. In the high-risk patient group, pooled RR was 1.39 (0.64-3.03) and in low-risk population pooled RR was 1.53 (0.79-2.96). Pooled RR for acute pancreatitis was 1.64 (0.46-5.81) with no heterogeneity. There was no difference in the rate of acute pancreatitis patients based on high-risk versus low-risk patients. Pooled RR for occurrence of biliary colic and cholecystitis during follow-up was 9.82 (4.27-22.59), I-2=0%. Pooled RR for cholangitis and recurrent jaundice was 2.16 (1.14-4.07), I-2=0%. However, there was no difference in the rate of cholangitis between the 2 groups in low-risk patients. Length of stay was shorter in the wait and watch group with a pooled mean difference was -2.70 (-4.71, -0.70) with substantial heterogeneity.Conclusions:Although we found no difference in mortality between the 2 strategies after ES, laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be recommended as it is associated with lower rates of subsequent recurrent cholecystitis, cholangitis, and biliary colic down the road even in high-risk surgical patients.

AB  - To achieve socio-economic and environmental sustainability, utilization of existing capacities and assets has become a key challenge for the transportation sector. This challenge has been recognised by many scholars, policy makers and practitioners leading to a substantial body of new concepts and models. The rather parallel evolution of the Physical Internet (PI) and synchromodal transport presents an opportunity to improve the current unsustainable freight transportation, by inducing a positive modal shift from roads to rails and inland waterways, and improving service levels by better connecting production research with freight movement. This paper thus examines the synchromodal and PI state-of-the-art models together with their designs, methodologies and findings proposed in the scientific literature. The main objective is to assess and explore the correlations between these two concepts in order to understand how they can reinforce each other. Despite the integrated vision of the Alliance for Logistics Innovation through Collaboration in Europe, the findings of this paper yield no well-established interconnections in the scientific literature between PI and synchromodality as they both merely coexist in parallel and address different dimensions, scales and levels of abstraction. This paper thus identifies potential synergies, future research directions and critical questions to be considered by modellers, developers and policy makers.

AB  - Hundreds of thousands of bats are killed annually by colliding with wind turbines in the U.S., yet little is known about factors causing variation in mortality across wind energy facilities. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of bat collision mortality with wind turbines by reviewing 218 North American studies representing 100 wind energy facilities. This data set, the largest compiled for bats to date, provides further evidence that collision mortality is greatest for migratory tree-roosting species (Hoary Bat [Lasiurus cinereus], Eastern Red Bat [Lasiurus borealis], Silver-haired Bat [Lasionycteris noctivagans]) and from July to October. Based on 40 U.S. studies meeting inclusion criteria and analyzed under a common statistical framework to account for methodological variation, we found support for an inverse relationship between bat mortality and percent grassland cover surrounding wind energy facilities. At a national scale, grassland cover may best reflect openness of the landscape, a factor generally associated with reduced activity and abundance of tree-roosting species that may also reduce turbine collisions. Further representative sampling of wind energy facilities is required to validate this pattern. Ecologically informed placement of wind energy facilities involves multiple considerations, including not only factors associated with bat mortality, but also factors associated with bird collision mortality, indirect habitat-related impacts to all species, and overall ecosystem impacts.

AB  - The construction industry faces the challenges of balancing environmental concerns with the construction of new buildings. Although the government has identified the promotion of prefabricated construction as an important strategy for tackling this challenge, little attention has been paid by the government to the practical schemes to be used. To fill this gap, a systematic review was conducted of policies related to prefabricated construction in China. In this study, a policy reviewed framework for the prefabricated construction was established. A total of 133 prefabricated construction policies issued from 1956 to 2018 were reviewed by mixed content analysis. The results reveal a closely integrated policy network, the evolution of ambitious policy objectives, and the development of a combination of various policy instruments over the different stages. The most often employed prefabricated construction policy instrument was the standard. Initiatives and guidance were moderately used. The establishment of regulations has been largely ignored in China. In addition, although a diverse range of incentives has been offered, incentives were found to be the least frequently used due to their associated fiscal burdens on governments. Based on our results, a roadmap is proposed for optimizing the existing prefabricated construction policies. The findings of this study increase our understanding of construction policies and how to optimize the existing policies to promote prefabricated construction in China. The study also provides a valuable reference for the large-scale promotion of prefabricated construction in other countries and regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   The temporal and spatial change in trends of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in typhoid have not been systematically studied, and such information will be critical for defining intervention, as well as planning sustainable prevention strategies.
   Methodology and findings
   To identify the phenotypic trends in AMR, 13,833 individual S. Typhi isolates, reported from 1973 to 2018 in 62 publications, were analysed to determine the AMR preponderance over time. Separate analyses of molecular resistance determinants present in over 4,000 isolates reported in 61 publications were also conducted. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) typhoid is in decline in Asia in a setting of high fluoroquinolone resistance while it is on the increase in Africa. Mutations in QRDRs in gyrA (S83F, D87N) and parC (S801) are the most common mechanisms responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance. Cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi, dubbed extensively drug-resistant (XDR) is a real threat and underscores the urgency in deploying the Vi-conjugate vaccines.
   Conclusion
   From these observations, it appears that AMR in S. Typhi will continue to emerge leading to treatment failure, changes in antimicrobial policy and further resistance developing in S. Typhi isolates and other Gram-negative bacteria in endemic regions. The deployment of typhoid conjugate vaccines to control the disease in endemic regions may be the best defence.

AB  - The European Commission has promoted revisiting and developing approaches for the successful integration of migrants all over Europe. One possible response to address this challenge is using nature as an arena for social integration of newcomers. In this study, we review European research on the relationship between nature and integration of immigrants. The aim is to contribute to the theoretical understanding of nature-based integration of immigrants as well as to reveal the possible contribution of nature and green spaces to the integration of immigrants in Europe. Based on a systematic review, we identified 11 European papers that linked nature to the integration of the immigrants. The relationship between nature and integration can be understood in terms of: 1) Structural integration describing access to common resources and main institutions of society, 2) cultural integration with aquisition of knowledge and competences, cultural aspects, common practices, general rules of behaviour, 3) interactive integration describing friendships and social interactions, 4) identificational integration with emotional bonds to other groups and places. According to the results, nature can be understood as a means to integration but also as a resource that should be equally accessible to all. This study concludes that in order to respond to the need for new solutions to the successful integration of immigrants, researchers should turn attention from describing and analyzing immigrants' perceptions and use of nature into developing and analyzing nature-based solutions and interventions for the purposes of integration.

AB  - Land, as a factor of production, has a vital role within the agricultural sector compared with other sectors. However, in recent years, land mobility has become a significant issue around the world with increased concentration and competition for land ownership, limiting the overall competitiveness of the agri-food sector and constraining the potential opportunities for new entrant farmers to access land. While land leasing is increasingly being embraced as a common form of land tenure serving as an alternative to the purchase of land for agriculture, the length of lease has been shown to have a significant impact on land productivity and sustainability. In this study, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review exploring the benefits of longer-term land leasing with a particular focus on developed countries and some selected developing countries in the context of commercial farming with more formal arrangements. Specifically, we highlight the barriers to long-term land leasing and identify potential incentives that might be adopted to encourage long-term land leasing for both landowners and farmers who seek to rent land.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review to identify feed additives, listed on Annex 1 of the European Union Register of Feed Additives, that have potential to reduce polluting emissions from livestock and to conduct a very simple meta-analysis of the collated data in order to identity the potential efficacy of these substances and agents. This study differs from the many other meta-analyses published in this general area in that it encompasses a broader range of environmental impacts and animal species within a single study than has occurred heretofore. The review identified 37 substances and agents offering benefits for 6 different potentially polluting emissions: gaseous releases of ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, odours, and excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus for four animal groups: cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. The meta-analysis showed that very considerable reductions in these emissions may be achievable, particularly in respect to ammonia and greenhouse gases. Estimates based on modest levels of usage in the European Union suggest that a reduction greater than 168 kt ammonia and 7100 kt methane could be achievable. However, in order to maximize these benefits regulators and the wider industry need to implement policies, processes and incentives to encourage greater uptake.

AB  - The review's objective was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the findings of all primary research published in English or French, investigating prevalence of zoonotic or potentially zoonotic bacteria, bacterial resistance to antimicrobials, and somatic cell count (SCC) in organic dairy production, or comparing organic and conventional dairy production, using a systematic review methodology. Among 47 studies included in the review, 32 comparison studies were suitable for quality assessment. Fifteen studies were not assessed for quality, due to their descriptive nature or a low sample size (n <= 2 farms). Overall, bacterial outcomes were reported in 17 studies, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) of zoonotic or potentially zoonotic bacteria in 12 and 7 studies, respectively. Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli including Shiga toxin-producing strains, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and SCC were investigated in 2, 7, 4, 6, and 15 studies, respectively. Contradictory findings were reported for differences in bacterial outcomes and SCC between dairy production types (organic vs. conventional). Lower prevalence of AMR on organic dairy farms was reported more consistently in studies conducted in the United States, as opposed to those conducted in Europe. These conflicting findings may result from geographic differences in organic production regulations governing antimicrobial usage, use of antimicrobials in conventional dairy production, and baseline prevalence, as well as laboratory methods, study designs, or methods of analysis employed. The majority (four of seven) of MDR investigations reported no significant differences in prevalence. Overall, only 9 of 32 studies met all five methodological soundness criteria. More well designed, executed, and reported primary research is needed at the farm and post-farm levels.

AB  - Citizen science (CS), as an enabler of open science (OS) practices, is a low-cost and accessible method for data collection in biodiversity monitoring, which can empower and educate the public both on scientific research priorities and on environmental change. Where OS increases research transparency and scientific democratisation; if properly implemented, CS should do the same. Here, we present the findings of a systematic review exploring "openness " of CS in biodiversity monitoring. CS projects were scored between - 1 (closed) and 1 (open) on their adherence to defined OS principles: accessible data, code, software, publication, data management plans, and preregistrations. Openness scores per principle were compared to see where OS is more frequently utilised across the research process. The relationship between interest in CS and openness within the practice was also tested. Overall, CS projects had an average open score of 0.14. There was a significant difference in open scores between OS principles (p = < 0.0001), where "open data " was the most adhered to practice compared to the lowest scores found in relation to preregistrations. The apparent level of interest in CS was not shown to correspond to a significant increase in openness within CS (p = 0.8464). These results reveal CS is not generally "open " despite being an OS approach, with implications for how the public can interact with the research that they play an active role in contributing to. The development of systematic recommendations on where and how OS can be implemented across the research process in citizen science projects is encouraged.

AB  - Smart cities are a natural evolution of the concept of sustainable cities. These cities can be analyzed by social, economic, environmental, and technological biases. For this work, we chose the social and economic vision, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable territories of Brazilian cities. These territories in Brazil are called slums, places of poverty but with opportunities for the development of the creative economy with its own brand. Seen by many in a simplistic way, summed up to be geographic spaces of drug circulation dominated by trafficking, Brazilian favelas have been consolidating themselves as a storehouse of innovative minds, a creative territory with multiple and complex cultures. These places today are capable of producing a positive image with potential for market exploitation. Therefore, the objective was to draw a relationship between the creative economy, branding and favelas, considering the concept of smart cities that include products and services from the slums. The present study shows the results of a survey and a bibliographic analysis based on the methodology Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and with parameters that took into account the favela, branding and the creative economy. Thus, we expect that it will be possible to point out ways to accelerate entrepreneurial actions and foster the development of these locations.

AB  - The implementation of environmental flows (e-flows) aims to reduce the negative impacts of hydrological alteration on freshwater ecosystems. Despite the growing attention to the importance of e-flows since the 1970s, actual implementation has lagged. Therefore, we explore the limitations in e-flows implementation, their systemic reasons, and solutions. We conducted a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis to identify peer-reviewed articles published on the topic of e-flows implementation research in the last two decades, resulting in 68 research and review papers. Co-occurrence of terms, and geographic and temporal trends were analyzed to identify the gaps in environmental water management and propose recommendations to address limitations on e-flows implementation. We identify the underlying causes and potential solutions to such challenges in environmental water management. The limitations to e-flow implementation identified were categorized into 21 classes. The most recognized limitation was the competing priorities of human uses of water (n = 29). Many secondary limitations, generally co-occurring in co-causation, were identified as limiting factors, especially for implementing more nuanced and sophisticated e-flows. The lack of adequate hydrological data (n = 24) and ecological data (n = 28) were among the most mentioned, and ultimately lead to difficulties in starting or continuing monitoring/adaptive management (n = 28) efforts. The lack of resource/capacity (n = 21), experimentation (n = 19), regulatory enforcement (n = 17), and differing authorities involved (n = 18) were also recurrent problems, driven by the deficiencies in the relative importance given to e-flows when facing other human priorities. In order to provide a clearer path for successful e-flow implementation, system mapping can be used as a starting point and general-purpose resource for understanding the sociohydrological problems, interactions, and inherited complexity of river systems. Secondly, we recommend a system analysis approach to address competing demands, especially with the use of coupled water-energy modeling tools to support decision-making when hydropower generation is involved. Such approaches can better assess the complex interactions among the hydrologic, ecological, socioeconomic, and engineering dimensions of water resource systems and their effective management. Lastly, given the complexities in environmental water allocation, implementation requires both scientific rigor and proven utility. Consequently, and where possible, we recommend a move from simplistic flow allocations to a more holistic approach informed by hydroecological principles. To ease conflicts between competing water demands, water managers can realize more 'pop per drop' by supporting key components of a flow regime that include functional attributes and processes that enhance biogeochemical cycling, structural habitat formation, and ecosystem maintenance.

AB  - In implementing a Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) for food waste products, several risks must be borne by producers or third parties. This research aims to identify risks in RSC operations, analyze existing methods and approaches, and improve a further framework model for managing the risk of RSC for the sustainability of the agricultural food industry. Using the PRISMA protocol, data was collected from a systematic review and synthesis of 78 articles published between 2012 and 2021. The result showed that although several research have been carried out on RSC risk, there is still very little research on risk management in the agri-food industry. It also found the potential aspects for future research in managing RSC risk in the agri-food industry, include process risk by considering product damage, supply-demand uncertainty, quantity and quality product return uncertainty, transportation and technology, and financial and environmental risk. According to the literature, MILP and integration with other approaches are frequently used in decision-making to manage the risk of RSC. Exploration of future research requires developing RSC risk management in the integrated agri-food industry. Furthermore, it is important to optimize the risk management of the RSC by considering the complexity of the risk and designing the sustainability of the RSC network in the agri-food industry. Focus is presently on the Hybrid Intelligent Decision Support System (HIDSS) approach for the development of a concept is the most appropriate new concept to reduce various types of risks in the RSC of the agri-food industry.

AB  - This article examines the state of research on sport entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity in sport management. Sport is an increasingly important sector of the global economy, yet little attention has been given to the role of entrepreneurship in its development. This article argues that entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity are crucial drivers of change, innovation, and employment in sport and that sport entrepreneurship is an emerging but unorganized stream of business research. To better understand the relationship between these research fields, we performed a study that combined a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis. This article presents thematic shifts in the field of sport entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. It proposes an integrated model of sport entrepreneurship, offering novel perspectives that contribute to the field. Furthermore, the article addresses the lack of research on creativity, sustainability, and the sport entrepreneur, charting underexplored territories. Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of current research on sport entrepreneurship and identifies key areas for future investigation.

AB  - The emergence of new transformational technology, known as the fourth industrial revolution, has crucially opened a new window to green economic growth. The transition to low carbon, green economy, and green sustainability has gained momentum simultaneously in developed and developing countries. The greening policy echoes the pending climate change and its entrenching disruptions. Financial technology, or FinTech seems to be a promising direction in unlocking the green dilemma; to be concrete, FinTech and the green economy are separately documented in the literature. Against this background, the current study investigates the intersection between green economic growth and FinTech by conducting a systematic-cum-bibliometric analysis of published papers in the Scopus database with the goal of first examining the role and opportunities of implementing green FinTech as a stimulus for transition towards green economic growth in African countries and, second, identifying knowledge gaps and future policy and research directions by developing an integrated framework to help African countries in the transition to green economic growth and green FinTech. The results illustrate an increasing trend in research attention towards the green FinTech concept and its relationship with green economic growth, climate change, and greening rules and standards. A deep inspection of the mined papers indicates that future research trajectories are oriented into five different mainstreams: technology and instruments in digital finance; regulation, policies, and green FinTech; climate risk mitigation through FinTech; FinTech and environmental quality; green finance and climate change mitigation. Based on these research directions, an integrated framework was conceptualised that aims to deliver green economic growth using FinTech as a vehicle of transition for African countries.

AB  - Urban water scarcity (UWS) has become a major constraint on socioeconomic development. To understand the research advances of UWS in China, we systematically reviewed literature published from 2002 to 2022. First, we quantified the 112 relevant publications' characteristics and summarized the relative methods. Then, we reviewed the evaluation results, influencing factors, socioeconomic and environmental effects, and response strategies. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges of existing research and proposed future directions. We found that China's UWS has gradually received more attention. The literature showed that 107 cities were waterstressed. Relative studies focused on large cities and the quantity-induced UWS in North China and Northwest China and the quality-induced UWS across the country. Thirteen classes of indicators were frequently used in UWS assessments, but a comparable evaluation system across different scales and cities is still lacking. China's UWS is mainly attributed to human activities followed by climate change and has influenced the environment, residents' health, and economic development within and beyond cities, but comprehensive assessments of driving forces, effects and solutions are lacking. To promote UWS research and improve urban sustainability under new-type urbanization and climate change, a framework covering various data sources, multiple scales, and diverse dimensions was proposed.

AB  - BackgroundInvolving men and boys as both users and supporters of Family Planning (FP) is now considered essential for optimising maternal and child health outcomes. Evidence on how to engage men and boys to meet FP needs is therefore important. ObjectivesThe main objective of this review was to assess the strength of evidence in the area and uncover the effective components and critical process- and system-level characteristics of successful interventions. Search MethodsWe searched nine electronic databases, seven grey literature databases, organisational websites, and the reference lists of systematic reviews relating to FP. To identify process evaluations and qualitative papers associated with the included experimental studies, we used Connected Papers and hand searches of reference lists. Selection CriteriaExperimental and quasi-experimental studies of behavioural and service-level interventions involving males aged 10 years or over in low- and middle-income countries to increase uptake of FP methods were included in this review. Data Collection and AnalysisMethodology was a causal chain analysis involving the development and testing of a logic model of intervention components based on stakeholder consultation and prior research. Qualitative and quantitative data relating to the evaluation studies and interventions were extracted based on the principles of 'effectiveness-plus' reviews. Quantitative analysis was undertaken using r with robust variance estimation (RVE), meta-analysis and meta-regression. Qualitative analysis involved 'best fit' framework synthesis. ResultsWe identified 8885 potentially relevant records and included 127 in the review. Fifty-nine (46%) of these were randomised trials, the remainder were quasi-experimental studies with a comparison group. Fifty-four percent of the included studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias. A meta-analysis of 72 studies (k = 265) showed that the included group of interventions had statistically significantly higher odds of improving contraceptive use when compared to comparison groups (odds ratio = 1.38, confidence interval = 1.21 to 1.57, prediction interval = 0.36 to 5.31, p < 0.0001), but there were substantial variations in the effect sizes of the studies (Q = 40,647, df = 264, p < 0.0001; I-2 = 98%) and 73% was within cluster/study. Multi-variate meta-regression revealed several significant intervention delivery characteristics that moderate contraceptive use. These included community-based educational FP interventions, interventions delivered to women as well as men and interventions delivered by trained facilitators, professionals, or peers in community, home and community, or school settings. None of the eight identified intervention components or 33 combinations of components were significant moderators of effects on contraceptive use. Qualitative analysis highlighted some of the barriers and facilitators of effective models of FP that should be considered in future practice and research. Authors' ConclusionsFP interventions that involve men and boys alongside women and girls are effective in improving uptake and use of contraceptives. The evidence suggests that policy should continue to promote the involvement of men and boys in FP in ways that also promote gender equality.
   Recommendations for research include the need for evaluations during conflict and disease outbreaks, and evaluation of gender transformative interventions which engage men and boys as contraceptive users and supporters in helping to achieve desired family size, fertility promotion, safe conception, as well as promoting equitable family planning decision-making for women and girls.

AB  - Reefer logistics is an important part of the cold chain in which reefer containers are involved as the packaging for transporting perishable goods. Reefer logistics is challenging, as it deals with cost and time constraints as well as the product quality and sustainability requirements. In many situations, there is a trade-off between these factors (e.g., between transportation cost and the quality of fresh products). Furthermore, considering the high value of reefers, the efficient logistics of reefers is as important as the efficient cargo flows. This causes technical complications and the conflicts of interests between actors, especially, between cargo owners (or shippers) and the asset owners (or transport/terminal operators). Improving the efficiency of reefer logistics calls for a thorough understanding of the trade-offs and complexities. This paper aims to help develop such an understanding using a systematic literature review and a socio-technical system analysis. The results can be used to provide managerial insights for actors involved in a cold chain to design tailored solutions for reefers.

AB  - The main objective of this research is to analyze the most relevant aspects of the management of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and the Sustainable and Circular Production Models (SCPMs) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The bibliometric method was used for the analysis of 190 studies obtained from the Scopus and Latin America and The Caribbean on Health Sciences (LILACS) databases. The systematic review provided information on the main research approaches: identification and characterization; quantification; strategic and interdisciplinary management; and processes for treatment or valorization. Finally, an evaluation of public policies and strategies was performed. The results show that Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia have the highest number of publications on OFMSW. The findings also indicate that both research and policy strategies on SCPMs prioritize bioenergy and biofuels as the leading alternatives for the valorization of OFMSW. It also reflects the relevance of the Circular Economy (CE) and Bioeconomy (BE) as the main drivers of waste recovery and/or valorization in LAC. These aspects are of great interest to governments that are still in the process of implementing SCPMs. However, for those more advanced in this area, it provides valuable information on progress, policy effectiveness, and future actions for improvement.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic review of studies assessing the impact of climate change on crop yields in southern Africa. Moreover, it synthesises the current knowledge of the impact of elevated ambient CO2 levels (eCO(2)) and temperatures on physiological processes, and the application of this knowledge in mechanistic crop models. While eCO(2) evidently has a strong impact on photosynthesis and crop water use, it is uncertain how this will work out for the climatic and crop management conditions prevailing in southern Africa. The impact of heat stress on crop reproductive processes and the process of transpiration cooling mitigating heat stress are poorly represented in models, while both process are relevant given the climatic conditions prevailing in southern Africa. Twenty studies assessing the impact of climate change on future yields of crops, mostly maize, have been retrieved. The results suggest that potato, Bambara groundnut and sugarcane yields may improve. No consistent trends for maize and sorghum could be identified. While yield predictions are obviously context-specific, large uncertainties related to climate predictions and crop models imply results should be treated with caution. Suggestions are made for field experimentation and the improved application of crop models for climate change research in the region.

AB  - Dam removal has been increasingly reported globally and is becoming an important approach for river management, restoration and environmental conservation in damming rivers. However, current limited knowledge of global trends in dam removal and related research may be potentially biased in terms of the geographic distribution and organisms studied. Such bias could mislead dam removal planning and management in different areas and ecological conservation for different taxa. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed datasets of dam removal and publications of dam removal research using bibliometric methods. A total of 1449 dam removal documents were published from 1953 to 2016. Trends, current hotspots and future directions of dam removal research were identified. The results from this study reveal that dam removal largely occurred in the North America and Europe, and most of the removed dams were small and old dams. With respect to the topic analysis, more dam removal studies should focus on the responses of a wide range of organisms, not only fish, as well as the interspecies relationships, food webs and ecosystem structures and functions. Based on our findings, we also provide some suggestions for future dam removal planning and analysis.

AB  - There has been a significant increase in the use of photovoltaics over the last two decades and according to many forecasts, the next two decades are expected to be characterised by even more dynamic growth. However, the long-term durability of PV panels will primarily depend on the effectiveness of legislation and processes that will be adopted to recycle an unprecedented amount of end-of-life panels to be built in the coming decades and the ones that desperately need to be recycled (predicted amount of photovoltaic waste by 2050: 78 million tonnes). As the main part of this research, a systematic review of the literature was carried out. The aim of this was to create a conceptual framework for the analysis of the fraction separation potential in the recycling process of PV panels at the installation site from the economic and environmental safety perspective, because it is agreed that the main cost that has the greatest environmental impact in the process of recycling materials from PV panels is the transport. According to this review, there is a research gap in terms of research on the recycling potential of photovoltaic panels at the site; however, those studies that touch this area clearly indicate the potential benefits, both economic and environmental.

AB  - As the volume of research on intercultural adaptation of international students (IAIS) increases significantly over the past decades, a systematic review of the diverse literature on a global scale and its development process becomes essential. This study conducted a thorough bibliometric analysis for the knowledge domain of IAIS research using relevant articles (N = 1,126) from 1990 to 2022 in Thompson Reuter's Web of Science (WoS) database-Core Collection. This work aims to analyze the advances and trends on the subject using a set of bibliometric analytical tools, including Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and BibExcel. The research findings demonstrate that the number of published articles projects an ostensible upward trend in terms of temporal distribution, especially since 2007. The USA occupies a leading position in terms of the largest publication output and a greater influence therewith. The most productive journal, author(s), and institution(s) are International Journal of Intercultural Relations, Brown L and Wang KT, and the University of Hong Kong and the University of Queensland, respectively. Collaboration in this field has become mainstream but still needs to be enhanced among researchers and at national and institutional levels. The frequency and co-occurrence analysis of keywords reveals that the main keywords for discussion include international students, adjustment, acculturation, adaptation, acculturative stress, identity, social support, stress, experiences, and depression, while cultural intelligence and intercultural sensitivity, culture shock and intercultural challenges, and integration and migration serve as the emerging themes. The study would aid academic researchers and policymakers in understanding the intricacies of IAIS and identifying areas that require further investigation.
   A systematic review of literature on international students' intercultural adaptation (1990-2022)1. This research conducted an extensive analysis of 1,126 pertinent articles published between 1990 and 2022, sourced from Thompson Reuter's Web of Science (WoS) database-Core Collection. Employing various bibliometric tools like Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and BibExcel, the study aimed to uncover trends and advancements in IAIS research. 2. The findings revealed a significant increase in the publication of IAIS articles, particularly after 2007, signifying the growing importance of this field. The United States emerged as a central hub for research, leading both in terms of publication volume and influence. Notably, the International Journal of Intercultural Relations (IJIR) stood out as the most prolific journal, while authors Brown L and Wang KT, along with institutions like the University of Hong Kong and the University of Queensland, made substantial contributions. 3. Collaboration among researchers in IAIS has gained traction but offers opportunities for further development, both at individual researcher levels and within national and institutional contexts. Keyword analysis highlighted key topics, including international students, adjustment, acculturation, and related factors like acculturative stress, identity, and social support. Emerging themes encompassed cultural intelligence, culture shock, intercultural challenges, and issues concerning integration and migration. 4. This study holds significance for academic researchers and policymakers by providing a comprehensive overview of IAIS research trends. It aids in unraveling the complexities of international student adaptation, thereby pinpointing areas deserving of more in-depth investigation.

AB  - Sacred natural sites (SNS) are valuable biocultural hotspots and important areas for nature conservation. They are attracting a growing attention in academic, management, and political fora. The relevance and implications of the sacred nature of these sites for the multiple actors involved in their management is widely acknowledged. However, the complexities and ambiguities surrounding the notion of "the sacred" have not been researched in depth. Because few previous scholarly works have specifically examined a topic that has profound implications for conservation as well as for the communities inhabiting these sites, we aim to fill in the gap by unraveling the conceptualizations and assumptions of "the sacred" in academic, peer reviewed SNS publications. Through a systematic review of the literature performed from a conservation lens, our findings unveil that: (1) Conservationists and protected areas managers have paid much more attention to SNS than social scientists and religious studies scholars; (2) The sacredness motif tends to be predominantly associated with taboos, bans, and regulations of community-managed resources; (3) The sacred is a highly complex concept often used in a binary, dichotomous way, as opposed to the profane and wild related; (4) An instrumental view of the sacred can limit the potential to include other intangible values in management and exclude relevant stakeholders; and (5) The insights from cultural anthropology, political ecology, and religious studies unveil the power dynamics and hidden assumptions that often go unnoticed in the literature. These perspectives should be included in the management of SNS and in policymaking.

AB  - Urban flood resilience can critically diminish the negative effects of extreme climatic conditions. In recent decades, green infrastructure has been gaining attention among researchers and authorities in terms of its use in urban contexts to enhance urban resilience. This paper tries to provide knowledge on how urban flood resilience has been recently approached through green infrastructure. To do this, the distribution of the topics of interest, authors, and sources/regions of publication are investigated through a systematic review of recent articles. Additionally, the methodological approaches and green infrastructure typologies are examined. Findings show an agglomeration of publications in developed countries. It was also observed that there is a predominance of quantitative methodological approaches and a low connectivity for some hot topics within this field of research (e.g., biodiversity). The most common green infrastructure typologies used in urban flood resilience research are also discussed. It is noticeable that more than half of the papers used general terms (e.g., urban park/open space) to describe green infrastructure rather than using technical typologies providing more information on water flow management characteristics. The outcomes are discussed to give an overview of the latest hotspots and gaps in this field of research, which gives some future directions/expectations to be followed in forthcoming investigations.

AB  - Objective. Poor medication adherence is a longstanding problem, and is especially pertinent for individuals with chronic conditions or diseases. Adherence to medications can improve patient outcomes and greatly reduce the cost of care. The purpose of the present review is to describe the literature on the use of incentives as applied to the problem of medication adherence.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed empirical evaluations of incentives provided to patients contingent upon medication adherence.
   Results. This review suggests that incentive-based medication adherence interventions can be very effective, but there are few controlled studies. The studies on incentive-based medication adherence interventions most commonly feature patients taking medication for drug or alcohol dependence. HIV, or latent tuberculosis. Across studies that reported percent adherence comparisons, incentives increased adherence by a mean of 20 percentage points, but effects varied widely. Cross-study comparisons indicate a positive relationship between the value of the incentive and the impact of the intervention. Post-intervention evaluations were rare, but tended to find that adherence effects diminish after the interventions are discontinued.
   Conclusions. Incentive-based medication adherence interventions are promising but understudied. A significant challenge for research in this area is the development of sustainable and cost-effective long-term interventions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - This paper reviews the role of two significant smart technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BT) in achieving sustainable tourism success. Such changes will maintain consistent tourism growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by improving environmental, social and economic sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a qualitative approach focusing on AI and blockchain-based adaptations towards sustainability in technology-driven platforms, particularly in the tourism sector. However, this study is conceptualized with Day's (1989) IMRAD (introduction, methods, results and discussion) framework and Hall's (2012) suggestions. This reinforced the structure of this article by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) concept. In addition, the entire study proceeds by way of accentuating the research question. Findings - The potential of these technologies (AI and blockchain) can internalize a win-win situation for economic prosperity and sustainable conservation of environmental resources. Even though, apathy among potential tourists (of traditional mass tourism) can be revived under sustainable tourism in the region through smart technology. Replacing traditional practices and policies with innovative technologies can reduce the adverse effect on environmental and cultural resources. Originality/value - This research justifies the potential for AI and blockchain to balance economy-oriented tourism and sustainability-prone technologically advanced tourism as a caustic issue for the MENA region. Indeed, this study has revitalized and transformed the less eventful margins of leading cultural-heritage-based tourism into sustainable profitability with concerns over diversity, socio-economic conditions, economic recession and burgeoning geopolitical instability.

AB  - Maritime transportation plays a critical role in global trade, and studies on maritime transportation safety management are of great significance to the sustainable development of the maritime industry. Consequently, there has been an increasing trend recently in studies on maritime transportation safety management, especially in terms of safety risk analysis and emergency management. Therefore, the general idea of this article is to provide a detailed literature review of maritime transportation safety management based on 186 articles in the Web of Science (WOS) database published from 2011 to 2022. The purposes of this article are as follows: (1) to provide a statistics-based description and conduct a network-based bibliometric analysis on the basis of the collected articles; (2) to summarize the methodologies/technologies employed in maritime transportation safety management spatiotemporally; and (3) to propose four potential research perspectives in terms of maritime transportation safety management. Based on the findings and insights obtained from the bibliometric and systematic review, the development of a resilient maritime transportation system could be facilitated by means of data- or intelligence-driven technologies, such as scenario representation, digital twinning, and data simulation. In addition, the issues facing intelligent maritime shipping greatly challenge the current maritime safety management system due to the co-existence of intelligent and non-intelligent maritime operation.

AB  - In China, Community Health Centers (CHCs) are major providers of primary care services, but their potential in empowering patients' self-management capacity has not been assessed. This study aims to describe self-care practice patterns amongst CHC attendees in urban China.
   In this cross-sectional quantitative study, 3360 CHC patients from 6 cities within the Pearl Delta Region were sampled using multistage cluster sampling.
   Thirty-seven per cent had used with over-the-counter Chinese herbal medicines (OTC CHMs) in the past year and majority of respondents found OTC CHMs effective. OTC CHMs were more popular amongst those who needed to pay out of pocket for CHC services. Less than 10% used vitamins and minerals, and those with a lower socioeconomic background have a higher propensity to consume. Although doubts on their usefulness are expressed, their use by the vulnerable populationmay reflect barriers to access to conventional health care, cultural affinity, or a defense against negative consequences of illnesses. About 25% performed physical exercise, but the prevalence is lower amongst women and older people. Taiji seems to be an alternative for these populations with promising effectiveness, but overall only 6% of CHC attendees participated.
   These results suggest that CHCs should start initiatives in fostering appropriate use of OTC CHM, vitamins, and minerals. Engaging community pharmacists in guiding safe and effective use of OTC CHM amongst the uninsured is essential given their low accessibility to CHC services. Prescription of Taiji instead of physical exercises to women and older people could be more culturally appropriate, and the possibility of including this as part of the CHC services worth further exploration.

AB  - Tropical forests influence freshwater fish through multiple pathways, only some of which are well documented. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the current state of knowledge on forests and freshwater fish in the tropics. The existing evidence is mostly concentrated in the neotropics. The majority of studies provided evidence that fish diversity was higher where there was more forest cover; this was related to the greater heterogeneity of resources in forested environments that could support a wider range of species. Studies quantifying fish abundance (or biomass) showed mixed relationships with forest cover, depending on species-specific habitat preferences. We identify the key challenges limiting our current understanding of the forest-fish nexus and provide recommendations for future research to address these knowledge gaps. A clear understanding of the functional pathways in forest-freshwater ecosystems can improve evidence-based policy development concerned with deforestation, biodiversity conservation, and food insecurity in the tropics.

AB  - Sustainability is defined by current research as an interdisciplinary field comprising environmental, social, and economic aspects. This paper presents a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines investigating how authors currently view sustainability issues in the specific context of tunneling. Thereby, we introduce a new methodology for reviewing sustainability aspects in an interdisciplinary way, where key bibliographic metrics are derived from the metadata of the reviewed literature. Regarding the content of the articles, we cluster sustainability aspects into specific topics and discuss challenges and solutions. In addition, we examine the role of digital technologies applied in sustainable tunneling. Our results show that there is a lack of interdisciplinary studies and that the current research does not represent all three dimensions of sustainability equally. The current research focuses on assessing the status quo instead of presenting specific solutions. Finally, we see great potential to further leverage digital tools to enable sustainable tunneling.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel method of assessing biodiversity wherein samples are taken from the environment via water, sediment or air from which DNA is extracted, and then amplified using general or universal primers in polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using next-generation sequencing to generate thousands to millions of reads. From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era. In this paper, we review the basic methodology, benefits, and concerns of eDNA metabarcoding, and systematically cover the applications of the method in global ecology thus far, including biodiversity monitoring across all habitats and taxonomic groups, ancient ecosystem reconstruction, plant-pollinator interactions, diet analysis, invasive species detection, pollution responses, and air quality monitoring. We also discuss the future applications of the method as well as expected technological advances and how they may impact the way that eDNA metabarcoding may used in the future. eDNA metabarcoding is a unique method still in development and will likely remain in flux for some time as technology advances and procedures become standardized. However, as metabarcoding is optimized and its use becomes more widespread, it is likely to become an essential tool for ecological monitoring and global conservation study. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Invasive species are recognized as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity and dealing with them is a daunting challenge for protected area managers. Prioritization based on multiple criteria has been traditionally recommended as essential for the effective management of invasive species. A systematic literature review was undertaken to assess to what extent the scientific literature provides guidelines for implementing priority systems as part of management strategies for invasive plants in protected areas. We detected only 27 studies published up to 2019 reporting some kind of prioritization. Most of them were limited to a list of species built from a combination of biological information extracted from literature and data on the extent and effects of their presence in the area. Our review also revealed that risk analysis has been commonly confounded with prioritization tools. Despite the generalized recognition of the impact of invasive plants on biodiversity, managers of protected areas lack readily applicable support from scientific literature to set up prioritization schemes.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Although hydropower provides energy to fuel economic development across Amazonia, strategies to minimize or mitigate impacts in highly biodiverse Amazonian environments remain unclear. The growing number of operational and planned hydroelectrics requires robust scientific evidence to evaluate impacts of these projects on Amazonian vertebrates. Here, we investigated the existing scientific knowledge base documenting impacts of hydropower developments on vertebrates across Brazilian Amazonia. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature from 1945 to 2020 published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese to assess the temporal and spatial patterns in publications and the types of study design adopted as well as scientific evidence presented. Results: A total of 25 published articles documented impacts on fish (n = 20), mammals (n = 3), and reptiles (n = 2). Most study designs (88%) lacked appropriate controls, and only three studies adopted more robust Before-After-Control-Impact designs. The published evidence did not generally support causal inference with only two studies (8%) including appropriate controls and/or confounding variables. Conclusion: Decades of published assessments (60% of which were funded by hydropower developers or their subsidiaries) do not appear to have established robust evidence of impacts of hydropower dams on Amazonian vertebrates. This lack of robust evidence could limit the development of effective minimization and mitigation actions for the conservation of diverse vertebrate groups impacted by hydropower dams across Brazilian Amazonia. Implications for Conservation: To avoid misleading inferences, there is a need to integrate more robust study designs into impact assessments of hydropower developments in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may have significant environmental impacts although there are still few studies focusing solely on these effects. A vast majority of articles address environmental issues as a secondary outcome and, above all, emissions are the main topic. As the notion of environmental impacts concerns many aspects than just air pollution, this paper aims to explore and show the findings and flaws of current research with a wider vision. For that purpose, a systematic review of the scientific literature was carried out broadening the scope to land, water, noise, and light pollution in addition to air. The results reveal potential benefits of AVs due to technical improvements, new possibilities in design and traffic flow enhancement, but the benefits depend on penetration levels, shared mobility acceptance and the interaction with other modes of transport. On the other hand, negative effects are also identified related to the decrease in the value of trip time and user tendencies. Among other potential impacts, changes in land use are increasingly being studied. These changes can lead to significative impacts on emissions as well as on soil and water although the latter have not yet been considered. Lastly, the likely improvements in noise and light pollution are scarcely explored. Given the lack of study of some of the environmental outcomes of AVs, it is not possible to draw a precise conclusion on their overall impact, calling for more comprehensive studies that enable to identify all the measures to be taken to achieve a sustainable future.

AB  - Wildlife health assessments help identify populations at risk of starvation, disease, and decline from anthropogenic impacts on natural habitats. We conducted an overview of available health assessment studies in noncaptive vertebrates and devised a framework to strategically integrate health assessments in population monitoring. Using a systematic approach, we performed a thorough assessment of studies examining multiple health parameters of noncaptive vertebrate species from 1982 to 2020 (n = 261 studies). We quantified trends in study design and diagnostic methods across taxa with generalized linear models, bibliometric analyses, and visual representations of study location versus biodiversity hotspots. Only 35% of studies involved international or cross-border collaboration. Countries with both high and threatened biodiversity were greatly underrepresented. Species that were not listed as threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List represented 49% of assessed species, a trend likely associated with the regional focus of most studies. We strongly suggest following wildlife health assessment protocols when planning a study and using statistically adequate sample sizes for studies establishing reference ranges. Across all taxa blood analysis (89%), body composition assessments (81%), physical examination (72%), and fecal analyses (24% of studies) were the most common methods. A conceptual framework to improve design and standardize wildlife health assessments includes guidelines on the experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, and species conservation planning and management implications. Integrating a physiological and ecological understanding of species resilience toward threatening processes will enable informed decision making regarding the conservation of threatened species.

AB  - The growth of human societies worldwide has been associated with the degradation of natural resources; in particular, freshwater ecosystems are among the most seriously threatened. Riparian restoration has received much attention due to the importance of ecological functions and ecosystem services sustained by watercourses. The objective of this paper was to assess the environmental quality of riversides in a highly urbanized watershed in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area (Argentina) in order to identify rehabilitation opportunities. We conducted a stratified random sampling of 82 sites where we recorded 33 variables regarding geomorphologic traits, vegetation attributes and anthropogenic impacts. Pristine riparian habitats are almost completely extirpated throughout the watershed and most of the streams sampled showed signs of degradation related to multiple threats. We detected a degradation pattern that follows the urban-rural gradient occurring in the watershed which enabled the definition of four types of riversides. In order to identify potential river rehabilitation alternatives in accordance with each degradation driver detected, we performed a systematic review of the literature. We identified the fluvial rehabilitation techniques implemented and we grouped them into four types of measures: passive restoration, active abiotic techniques, active biotic techniques and active social techniques. We also recognized the reported social, ecological, economic and/or political constraints which were encountered in those experiences. All possible dimensions of the potential constraints should be recognized during the planning stage of rehabilitation and then properly addressed before and during the implementation of measures in order to make the interventions successful.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the effectiveness of structural-level environmental interventions on the changes in PA levels in the populations examined.MethodsNatural experiments that involve environmental intervention with structural modification were included. The primary outcome PA levels with consideration of both objective and subjective measurements. An electronic search was carried out in Medline/Pubmed, SCIENCE DIRECT, WEB OF SCIENCE, and CINAHL up to January 2022. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, selected studies, extracted relevant data, and examined study quality. A qualitative synthesis was performed.ResultsTwenty-six articles were included. The structural-level environmental interventions included 4 fundamental areas: schools, work environments, streets or cities, and neighborhoods or parks. Of the 26 studies, 21 examined outdoor environments like parks, cities, pedestrian walkways, or steps, while 5 examined indoor or closed environments like schools and workplaces revealing that structural-level environmental interventions improve PA levels with the greatest effect in parks and active transportation. A risk of bias is inherent in natural experiments which is a limitation of this study. In schools and work areas, there is evidence of both decrease in sedentary time and an increase in PA related to environmental modifications.ConclusionStructural-level environmental modifications in parks and active transportation demonstrated greater effects in promoting PA. Environmental modifications can impact physical activity in the population. Given that the economic and cultural setting is a key variable when considering the effectiveness of structural interventions, and since only 1 of the 26 reviewed articles included such data, more studies examining economic factors are needed especially in low- and middle-income countries like in South America.

AB  - Agriculture, the world's most dominant land use type, burdens freshwater biodiversity with a multitude of stressors such as diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alteration. However, it is difficult to directly link agricultural land use with biota response as agricultural stressors can also originate from other causes. Also, there is evidence for positive and negative effects of agriculture on organisms, agricultural impact differs strongly with the biological metric and study region considered and agricultural impact differs among practice and type, which in turn affects different organism groups with varying severity. Against this background, our study aimed at assessing, if agricultural land use has a consistent effect on river biota. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, which yielded 43 studies and 76 relationships between agriculture and aquatic organism groups. The relationships were subjected to a meta-analysis using Hedge's g to calculate the standardized mean difference of effects. Overall, we detected a medium to strong effect g = - 0.74 of agricultural land use on freshwater biota, only marginally influenced by study design, river type and region. Strong differences in biota response could be observed depending on the biological metric assessed, with ecological quality indices of agricultural impairment performing best. Sensitive taxa declined with agricultural impact, while tolerant taxa tended to benefit. In addition, the biota response differed among agricultural types and practices and organism group, with macroinvertebrates showing the strongest effect. Our results quantify the effects of agriculture on riverine biota and suggest biological metric types for assessing agricultural impact. Further research is needed to discriminate between agricultural types and account for intensity.

AB  - Halal tourism represents a distinct segment of the tourism industry for Muslims where relevant services adhere to the Islamic Shariah teachings. Halal tourism has already received increased attention in both non-Muslim and Muslim regions. The aim of this study is to clarify the ambiguity surrounding the concept of halal tourism. To achieve this aim, the objectives of this study are to standardise some dimensions of halal tourism, such as conceptions and definitions, principles, scope and impacts, trends, and opportunities and challenges. A systematic review of literature was conducted, and in total, 27 articles were taken into consideration, in which the review protocol proposed in this study makes use of specific techniques such as PRISMA, applied thematic analysis and bibliographic documentary review within a large hermeneutic-interpretative framework. The theoretical contribution of this study includes characterising the conception, definition and principle of halal marketing, and the practical contribution includes economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts.

AB  - For reducing health impacts from air pollution, it is important to know the sources contributing to human exposure. This study systematically reviewed and analysed available source apportionment studies on particulate matter (of diameter of 10 and 2.5 microns, PM10 and PM2.5) Performed in cities to estimate typical shares of the sources of pollution by country and by region. A database with city source apportionment records, estimated with the use of receptor models, was also developed and available at the website of the World Health Organization.
   Systematic Scopus and Google searches were performed to retrieve city studies of source apportionment for particulate matter. Six source categories were defined. Country and regional averages of source apportionment were estimated based on city population weighting.
   A total of 419 source apportionment records from studies conducted in cities of 51 countries were used to calculate regional averages of sources of ambient particulate matter. Based on the available information, globally 25% of urban ambient air pollution from PM2.5 is contributed by traffic, 15% by industrial activities, 20% by domestic fuel burning, 22% from unspecified sources of human origin, and 18% from natural dust and salt. The available source apportionment records exhibit, however, important heterogeneities in assessed source categories and incompleteness in certain countries/regions.
   Traffic is one important contributor to ambient PM in cities. To reduce air pollution in cities and the substantial disease burden it causes, solutions to sustainably reduce ambient PM from traffic, industrial activities and biomass burning should urgently be sought. However, further efforts are required to

AB  - Renewable energy is crucial to achieving carbon neutrality and supporting sustainable development, but its success depends on effective policies. This study aims to evaluate public policies and their influences on the use and diffusion of wind and solar PV into the Brazilian electricity grid and to understand if, and how, the two renewable sources could be affected by the post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario. This work plays an important role in the decarbonization of the electricity sector, highlights the need to modernize the Brazilian industrial park, and addresses new barriers to the development of renewable sources in the country. To carry out the analysis and answer the research questions, a mixed methodological approach was adopted covering the quantitative and qualitative aspects, led by a rigorous systematic review of the literature and semi-structured interviews with Brazilian stakeholders. The results revealed that 1/4 of the policies, characterized by socio-economic drives, were responsible for the growth of the share of wind and solar PV supply in the electrical mix, contributing to the decarbonization of the Brazilian energy mix. The results also suggest that new policies will be needed to ensure a greater presence of both sources in the electricity mix. The findings of the study reveal unpublished and valuable information capable of supporting policymakers and stakeholders in the diffusion of renewable sources. Further studies are needed to highlight other aspects, such as the need to modernize the "distribution" network and storage system for renewable technologies.

AB  - Gold mining has for several decades contributed to the socio-economic development of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, but it has also caused considerable environmental damage and human health concerns in mining communities. However, despite the extensive proliferation of policies and programs aimed at addressing the adverse environmental impact of mining, limited attention has so far been paid to identifying what might constitute environmental policy best practices across Sub-Saharan Africa's gold mining sector. To address this gap, this paper undertakes a systematic literature review of environmental policy measures and considers its broader implications for sustainable development in the context of gold mining in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 1,217 papers retrieved from the databases, 22 met the inclusion criteria and are included in evidence synthesis. Based on an in-depth analysis, we find that there are tensions and consensus in the environmental policy literature. However, extant works remain fragmented, uneven, and not systematically integrated. This perhaps might explain the difficulty in trying to develop and institutionalize best practices within the gold mining industry in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, we propose an integrated conceptual model that lays a foundation for possible environmental policy best practices within the mining industry in developing countries. The paper concludes by identifying specific theoretical and practical implications of the study and suggests possible avenues for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many biodiversity conservation strategies aim to increase species movement by changing the landscape between suitable areas of habitat. We applied systematic review and meta-analytical methods to robustly assess evidence on the impact of matrix structure on movement rates, with the hypothesis that movement will be greater through matrix of a more similar structure (vegetation height and cover) to the home habitat. Twenty studies of movement through two or more different matrix types provided 107 effect sizes, expressing the difference between the relative movement rates in different matrix types. The studies were all on animals, including relatively mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies but also rodents and amphibians. We were able to detect that on average, movement was greater through matrix of a more similar structure to the species' habitat despite the variation in studies in terms of matrix types, species and methods. The effect size was larger when there was a greater difference in the structure of the two matrix types being compared (e.g. comparing grassland to forest rather than short grass to long grass). However, there was a high degree of covariation between matrix contrast and studies and other significant subgroupings such as taxonomic group and matrix openness. The biological significance of the increase in movement is not clear; however, ecological theory predicts dispersing individuals are important for population dynamics. Changes to the structure of landscapes intended to improve permeability to movement are supported by the findings of this study, particularly for relatively mobile species. However, research over longer timescales, greater distances and range of taxonomic groups is necessary.

AB  - Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face various challenges such as lack of resources, financing, and networking capability. Many of the constraints could be mitigated with the help of proper governance in the SMEs. Many articles have explored the challenges faced by SMEs and how this challenge could be mitigated with the help of proper governance. However, very few studies have summarized the influence of governance in solving the problems of SMEs in one place. So, a systematic literature review has been made to find the role of governance in solving the problems of SMEs. As SMEs are the pillar of economic development for a country, their problems and solutions in one document could help practitioners and academician research and development further in this area. The findings suggest that governance may influence the problems associated with corporate networking, finance, cross-cultural interactions of SMEs.

AB  - 1. Biotic pollination can benefit crop production, but its effects are highly variable. To maximise benefits from this ecosystem service, we need a greater understanding of the factors that cause variation so that ecological intensification can be more effectively applied.
   2. We focus on understanding the benefits of pollination to faba bean Vicia faba. We use a literature review followed by multi-level meta-analysis to estimate overall benefits of pollination to faba bean yield and to quantify variation (heterogeneity) in these benefits associated with different contextual factors (e.g. plant genotype, growing environment).
   3. Our overall estimate of pollination benefit to faba bean yield, expressed as the percentage yield reduction without pollination, is 32.9% (confidence interval: 21%-43%). Based on the prediction intervals, which include the heterogeneity in pollination benefit, there is an 80% chance that pollination will increase yield of a faba bean crop.
   4. Half of all heterogeneity in pollination dependence was due to differences between plant genotypes. The number of beans per plant showed similar pollination dependence to yield mass per plant while pod number and number of beans per pod underestimated yield benefits. There was weak evidence to suggest pollination benefits vary between pollinator species, with honeybees showing a smaller yield increase.
   5. Differences in the experimental method used to assess pollination benefit did not significantly affect the estimate, including the growing environment, measurement scale, or whether the effects of experimental pollinator enclosures were controlled. This suggests that simplified experimental studies comparing yield of open-pollinated and enclosed plants can provide reliable insights into pollination benefits across a large range of plant genotypes and landscapes.
   6. Synthesis and application. We found high variability in pollination benefits both between and within publications in our meta-analysis. Plant genotype, how yield was measured, and pollinator species affected the level of pollination benefit. Despite variability in pollination benefits due to various contextual factors (both inside and outside of grower control), there is a high likelihood that biotic pollination will increase faba bean yield. Our findings support ecological intensification and specifically the management of pollinators to maximise pollination benefits to faba bean production.

AB  - It is estimated that at least one quarter of the world's population will be affected by water shortages in the coming years and by 2030 there will be a global water deficit of 40% if urgent action is not taken. Currently, the main consumer of water globally is agriculture. In addition, it has been estimated that to meet the demand for food by 2050, the water available for agricultural irrigation would have to increase by 70%. In this context, wastewater could become a relevant water resource to meet this growing demand. This article aims to show the state of the global research on sustainable use of wastewater in agriculture. To this end, a systematic qualitative analysis and a quantitative bibliometric analysis were conducted. The search was carried out for the period 2000-2019, and the analyzed sample comprised 1986 articles. The results show that this line of research is one of the most outstanding within agriculture and has gained special relevance during the last five years. Research has improved significantly at a technical level, but problems such as energy consumption, and the elimination of heavy metals and elements of chemical and pharmacological products, still need to be refined. There is a particular lack of contributions covering social aspects. This article can serve as a reference for both researchers and stakeholders interested in this topic.

AB  - This study sought to propose a theoretical model by determining the incident factors of agro-industrial territorial development based on the existing scientific literature and the exploration of successful case studies in the sector worldwide. A systematic review of the literature was carried out, with a bibliometric analysis and content analysis, recognizing elements associated with the improvement of competitiveness and territorial development. The factors identified as incidents of agro-industrial territorial development are: the short supply chain, protection of agri-food products with territorial identity, family farming, local food systems and agribusiness. These factors were integrated into a theoretical model in order to analyze the systemic interaction of each of the factors to find the causes or reasons for territorial development where activation mechanisms can be identified, such as: relational, spatial and technological proximity, the institutional framework from the territory, the support of public policy and the promotion of inclusive and integrated businesses in the value chain.

AB  - In the context of agricultural activity intensification and rural abandonment, neo-rurality has emerged as a back-to-the-land migratory movement led by urban populations seeking alternative ways of life close to nature. Although the initiatives of the new peasantry are diverse, most are land related, such as agriculture and livestock farming. A priori, neorural people undertake agri-food system activities in ways that differ from the conventional model, following the principles of environmental and social sustainability. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the neo-rural phenomenon with the main objective of examining how neo-rurality has been found to support agroecological transitions. The corpus of neo-rural studies was analyzed from a social-ecological perspective, and a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to determine whether neo-rural agri-food system activities follow agroecological principles. The results indicate that neo-rural studies is an emerging research field that has received considerable attention in western countries. Diverse conceptualizations and terms have been used to address the phenomenon, but the literature agrees on political and environmental motivations and several barriers faced by neo-rural people. This population and in particular new peasants, are employing a wide variety of agroecological practices and strategies throughout the agri-food system. Overall, neo-rural people have been reported to contribute significantly to agroecological transition.

   Methods: We use an approach of Leximancer to conduct the content analysis to explore the intellectual foundations, research context, topics, and methods of CR literature based on 583 published studies.
   Results: The results show that framework research of CR is a hot topic throughout the last 20 years. In the first stage (from 2001 to 2015), CR connected with the themes of "framework, disaster, change, and model". Comparatively, in the second stage (from 2016 to 2020), the themes of "social capital, capacity, and framework" are more salient connecting with CR. Additionally, the study detected that the key issues varied across countries. Specifically, research in the US focused on the social support dynamic, while in Australia, recovery from the disaster was the predominant theme. Furthermore, in the UK, studies mostly explore resilience issues in the background related to flooding.
   Discussion: Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of CR research covering the last 20 years and put forward thoughts and recommendations for future resilience studies considering 1) obstacles within daily life, 2) resilience set within organizational perspectives, and 3) cultural context.

AB  - Global climate change presents a threat for the environment, and it is aggravated by the mismanagement of water use in the agricultural sector. Since plants are the intermediate component of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, and their physiology is directly affected by water availability, plant-based approaches proved to be sensitive and effective in estimating plant water status and can be used as a possible water-saving strategy in crop irrigation scheduling. This work consists of two parts: the first part extensively reviews the plant-based methods and approaches that are most applied to monitor the plant water status (PWS), the different technologies available, the gaps, and the possibility of further improvements in establishing a sustainable irrigation schedule. The various approaches are described, and the differences between conventional and recent improved methods are analyzed. The second part is an extensive dataset survey of 83 publications from 2012 to 2022 that applied the main monitoring methodologies and approaches for water status assessment in fruit and nut tree crops cultivated in a Mediterranean climate. The aim of this work is to serve as a practical reference to deepen reader knowledge on PWS and enhance researchers to identify gaps and potential advances in designing user-friendly monitoring technologies.

AB  - Fashion is a global, multi-trillion dollar industry devoted to producing and selling clothing, footwear, and accessories to individuals or groups of people. Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.

AB  - Background: Adaptation will be necessary to cope with the impacts of climate change on the health of Canadians. Civil society organizations (CSOs) have an important role in health adaptation, but it is unknown what actions they are undertaking.
   Objectives: To identify and examine what adaptations are being developed by CSOs to adapt to the health effects of climate change based on a systematic review of the activities of 190 organizations and 1196 reported adaptation actions.
   Results: There were six key findings: (1) health adaptation actions are predominantly led by environmental CSOs; (2) most actions are occurring at national and regional levels; (3) food and/or water contamination and air quality are dominant climate change stimuli for action; (4) responses predominantly reflect awareness and research activities, with limited evidence of substantive intervention; (5) consideration of vulnerable groups is limited; and (6) climate change is usually considered alongside other factors, if at all.
   Conclusions: The results indicate a deficit in terms of what needs to be done for health adaptation and what is being done; part of a broader adaptation deficit in Canada. Coordinated adaptation planning at federal and provincial level is needed, involving collaboration between CSOs and public health bodies. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - Objective. To review the empirical consequences of the use of geoprocessing in the management of primary health care (PHC) services, in order to disseminate the benefits of this technology and analyze the challenges that must be overcome for its contribution to the development of PHC.
   Methods. A systematic review of primary studies published in Spanish, English or Portuguese between 2000 and 2017 was carried out. First, a review of the academic production was carried out by continent and type of objective. In a second stage, the studies that experimented with and evaluated the use of geoprocessing in empirical form were selected. Specific and generic benefits, as well as limitations, were reviewed.
   Results. 134 articles were identified in the first stage of selection, half of them from the Region of the Americas. Only nine studies met the criteria and were reviewed in the second stage. These studies showed that the use of geoprocessing generates benefits that go beyond the technical benefits, with limitations that can be overcome.
   Conclusions. Although the benefits of using geoprocessing have been widely discussed, few studies have evaluated its implementation in PHC empirically. Practical experiences, which could easily be reproduced in different communities, show that its continued use could increase the capacity to respond to the goals of PHC, as well as to the goals of sustainable development.

AB  - Studies of the futures of food answer questions such as 'do we need to increase global agricultural production to feed the world sustainably in 2050?' Conclusions vary dramatically. Similar variations and uncertainties are striking with respect to many other dimensions of food security and food systems. The sheer heterogeneity of methods used to explore the futures of food seems to undermine meaningful comparisons and aggregation between studies. These issues and others compromise responsible collective choices vital for humanity, nonhuman animals, and Earth systems. Disagreements on what policies and social actions we should adopt to shape the future of food depend on how we assess the evolution of food security and food systems over the long-term (at least 20 years into the future). Building upon foresight practice and theory, our team borrows tools from economics, STS, and philosophy to shed light on global food futures and food ethics. In this paper, we will introduce readers to some of our unpublished and provisional findings. We will cover two questions: (1) What does a systematic review of global food security modelling and projection studies reveal about predominant methods, food security indicators, drivers of change, and the range of future global food security projections? (2) Should the usual notion of a 'plausible' future explicitly or implicitly invoked in global food futures scenarios to delineate the range of futures worth exploring be modified or abandoned to set free our epistemic, ethical, and political imagination?

AB  - The extant literature has examined the role of environmental management practices on performance of the firms. The present study aims to provide a clear understanding of the research into the field using a systematic review methodology using a bibliographic database that is, "Web of Science" within the period 1990-2019. The descriptive findings present the journals in which the research papers are published, the countries where the research took place and the industrial sectors that the reviewed papers have covered. The paper contributes significantly to the existing literature and provides future research agendas in the area. This paper presents an integrated framework consisting of pressures on management decisions, environmental management strategies and performance by various stakeholders. Larger sample could be taken to study the relationship so as to generalize the findings. More comprehensive approach needs to be taken taking into account all the potential variables to eliminate omitted variable bias.

AB  - In this paper, we carry out a descriptive analysis of the historical conceptual development of soundscape. The aim is to identify how a study environment has been built around this proposal. We developed a selective search of the literature, starting with key texts by Murray Schafer and the World Soundscape Project, from which we traced its influence in different parts of the world. A period of expansion was identified during the 1980s, in which its two main approaches were shaped: the ecological and the perceptional-cultural. Likewise, special emphasis was placed on how the term was approached from the culturalist perspective in geography, and it was identified that from these discussions arose the proposal of auditive geographies and sound geographies. Finally, a systematic review was carried out in indexes and search engines of academic literature and we found a latent interest, during the last fifteen years, in incorporating sound as an objective of study from some of the positions mentioned (soundscape, auditive geographies, and sound geographies), however, it is a topic that is still in the process of consolidation.

AB  - The world is undergoing exponential urbanization, with consequences for society in general, both for cities and people, with serious economic, social and environmental implications. Therefore, it is crucial to reconsider urban models of cities, to ensure global, long-term sustainability. Numerous researchers have argued that one of these models involves eco-city projects, and this study aims to carry out a systematic review of the literature on this topic, through bibliometrics. To do so, the Smarter, Prisma and Vantage Point methods were used, reflecting the originality of the study. The results obtained show that China has aroused researchers' interest regarding its eco-city projects, with most studies being empirical, and so this study complements them. The main contribution of this research lies in identifying the keywords most used by authors, these being eco-cities, sustainable cities (cluster 1) and eco-cities, China, sustainable urban development and eco-cycle model (cluster 2). Finally, implications for theory and practice are presented, together with suggestions for future research.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Fine-needle biopsy (FNB) became a critical part of thyroid nodule evaluation in the 1970s. It is not clear how diagnostic accuracy of FNB has changed over time.
   OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the accuracy of thyroid FNB for diagnosis of malignancy in adults with a newly diagnosed thyroid nodule and to characterize changes in accuracy over time.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1975 to 2020 using search terms related to FNB accuracy in the thyroid.
   STUDY SELECTION English-language reports of cohort studies or randomized trials of adult patients undergoing thyroid FNB with sample size of 20 or greater and using a reference standard of surgical histopathology or clinical follow-up were included. Articles that examined only patients with known thyroid disease or focused on accuracy of novel adjuncts, such as molecular tests, were excluded. Two investigators screened each article and resolved conflicts by consensus. A total of 36 of 1023 studies met selection criteria.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The MOOSE guidelines were used for data abstraction and assessing data quality and validity. Two investigators abstracted data using a standard form. Studies were grouped into epochs by median data collection year (1975 to 1990, 1990 to 2000, 2000 to 2010, and 2010 to 2020). Data were pooled using a bivariate mixed-effects model.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was accuracy of FNB for diagnosis of malignancy. Accuracy was hypothesized to increase in later time periods, a hypothesis formulated prior to data collection.
   RESULTS Of 16 597 included patients, 12 974 (79.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 47.3 (12.9) years. The sensitivity of FNB was 85.6%(95% CI, 79.9-89.5), the specificity was 71.4%(95% CI, 61.1-79.8), the positive likelihood ratio was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.3-4.1), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.2-0.3). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 86.1%. Epoch was not significantly associated with accuracy. None of the available covariates could explain observed heterogeneity.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Accuracy of thyroid FNB has not significantly changed over time.

AB  - As the popularity of nature-based recreation and tourism grows, protected area (PA) managers around the world are faced with escalating monitoring and management challenges across spatial and temporal scales. Citizen science, an emerging research approach which involves active public participation and collaboration with scientists in the scientific process, is an innovative tool that could help managers address these challenges. This study applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review Recommendations (PRISMA) protocol to review published studies that utilized citizen science methods in recreation research, examining the extent and nature of such applications and identifying future opportunities. We identified 20 peer-reviewed journal articles from the Web of Science, most of which were published since 2015. These studies utilized different citizen science approaches to examine recreation patterns, behaviors, and impacts in terrestrial and marine PAs. We found that citizen science was used most often in marine PAs, with specialized recreationists (e.g., SCUBA divers) as the most frequent contributors. The types of volunteers recruited differed by their sources (i.e., general public, recreation specialists, and organizational affiliates) and roles (i.e., volunteers as agents of data collection and volunteers as research subjects), with innovative technology (e.g., participatory GIS) creating new engagement opportunities. Despite these benefits, the accuracy and reliability of citizen science data remain important considerations for managers. Our review demonstrates how citizen science can inform management and enhance public participation in PA stewardship activities, and it reveals the need for more research to explore applications of citizen science in different recreation contexts.

AB  - First-Year Engineering (FYE) education, while arguably established, is changing within a field that is evolving. To ensure that research is informing FYE change, there is a need for an overview of existing FYE research, which both summarizes what is known and provides direction for future research. The purpose of the review is to answer (1) What is the general landscape of FYE literature? and (2) What FYE practices are recommended or supported by the literature? Four journals were used as the source of articles. Through a three-step process, we identified 156 articles that focused on FYE that were included in the analysis. Of these, 73 were identified as research articles and both their methods and findings were explored in the study. FYE literature spans both innovative practice and research, and covers a wide-range of topics, such as Design, Pedagogy & Learning Theories, and Skills. Though, numerous studies document individual FYE programs, courses, or projects, many findings were limited to evaluating the activity in isolation. We did not find substantial literature examining the impact of FYE program design (e.g., matriculation decisions, course focus) on achieving engineering program outcomes. Future FYE research should more fully consider the theory and research designs used to promote generalizability and transferability of study findings beyond a single FYE experience or university.

AB  - As a result of growing complexities in the construction industry, system dynamics modeling (SDM) has been increasingly used in construction management (CM) research to explore complicated causal relationships at the various levels of construction and management processes. Given the rapid growth of SDM applications over the past two decades, a systematic review is needed to ascertain the state of the art and further trends in the area. This paper provides the results of a systematic analysis of 103 papers from 41 selected peer-reviewed journals from 1997 to 2016. The contributions of the papers are first analyzed, structured and formulated in terms of the year of publication, software involved, the combined use with other methods, and research design. With the assistance of the a keyword co-occurrence network analysis, eight research topics involving different internal and external complexities are identified, including: (1) sustainability, (2) project planning and control, (3) performance and effectiveness, (4) strategic management, (5) site and resource management, (6) risk analysis and management, (7) knowledge management, and (8) organization and stakeholder management. The analysis results reveal the pivotal role of SDM in streamlining different complicated casual relationships at the activity, project, and industry levels across the eight topics and its significant potential in uncovering the impact of complicated contextual conditions on project planning and control, effectiveness and performance, strategic management, and sustainability at the project and industry levels. Lastly, trends and recommendations for SDM applications are provided for future CM research. This paper provides a state of the art of SDM in CM applications and insights into opportunities and useful references for the future.

AB  - The emergence of digital transformation has changed the business landscape for the foreseeable future. As scholars advance their understanding and digital transformation begins to gain maturity, it becomes necessary to develop a synthesis to create solid foundations. To do so, significant steps need to be taken to critically, rigorously, and transparently examine the existing literature. Therefore, this article uses a meta-review with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocol. As a result, we identified six dimensions and seventeen categories related to digital transformation. The organizational, technological, and social dimensions are still pivotal in digital transformation, while two new dimensions (sustainability and smart cities) still need to be explored in the existing literature. The need to deepen knowledge in digital transformation and refine the dimensions found is of paramount importance, as it involves some complexity due to organizational dynamics and the development of new technologies. It was also possible to identify opportunities, challenges, and future directions.

AB  - Livestock grazing affects over 60% of the world's agricultural lands and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity. Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.

AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) is a biome of great socio-economic and environmental importance to Brazil. The rapid agricultural expansion in the Cerrado biome areas promoted biogeochemical cycles that affect nitrogen and carbon dynamics, leading to increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Brazil, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the main gas in agriculture, and agricultural practices increase emissions into the atmosphere. This review aimed to assess the influence of agriculture on N2O emissions in the Cerrado region, based on existing data in the literature, and extract patterns of direct N2O emissions in different agricultural systems in the Cerrado from existing data. A systematic review of data from 36 scientific publications in the Cerrado region with several crop systems revealed that N2O emissions varied from 0.15 kg ha(-1) in native cerrado to 4.84 kg ha(-1) in conventional tillage. Agricultural systems, nitrogen fertilizer application, and crop residues influence N2O emissions. One of the strategies to mitigate emissions is the sustainable intensification of farming systems. Cumulative N2O emissions in the Cerrado range from 0.001 to 4.84 kg ha(-1) in different land-use scenarios. Soil under the conventional tillage system (CT) had the highest emissions, with an overall average of 1.58 kg ha(-1) of N2O, compared to no-till system (NT) (0.82 kg ha(-1)) and native Cerrado 0.15 kg ha(-1). Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems in the Cerrado had emissions with an overall average of 1.68 kg ha(-1), integrated crop-livestock-forest systems (ICLF) had 1.20 ha(-1), and eucalyptus plantations had 0.48 kg ha(-1).

AB  - This paper introduces a methodology to assess the accuracy of engineering estimates in relation to the final project cost. The objective of this assessment is to develop a comprehensive approach towards obtaining a more reliable estimate of the project cost. This approach relies on the review of a synthesis of literature, which provides a basis for determining key components in the estimation of the capital cost of a project. A systematic review of existing data for selected projects was obtained as well. Employed data cover sampled public transportation projects to maintain existing infrastructure within selected geographical location and specified time. Enhanced analysis of existing data through statistical models was employed to indicate potential measures for prevention of errors in the estimate due to uncertainties in the time, cost, and method of construction. The comparison of results with similar findings from past research shows the effectiveness of presented methodologies and opportunities to enhance statistical analyses of bids and engineering estimates. Conclusions enable project managers to address uncertainties in the bidding process and enhance financial sustainability of projects within specific programs.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased since the middle of the 20th century, as evidenced by its applications to a wide range of engineering and science problems. Air traffic management (ATM) is becoming increasingly automated and autonomous, making it lucrative for AI applications. This paper presents a systematic review of studies that employ AI techniques for improving ATM capability. A brief account of the history, structure, and advantages of these methods is provided, followed by the description of their applications to several representative ATM tasks, such as air traffic services (ATS), airspace management (AM), air traffic flow management (ATFM), and flight operations (FO). The major contribution of the current review is the professional survey of the AI application to ATM alongside with the description of their specific advantages: (i) these methods provide alternative approaches to conventional physical modeling techniques, (ii) these methods do not require knowing relevant internal system parameters, (iii) these methods are computationally more efficient, and (iv) these methods offer compact solutions to multivariable problems. In addition, this review offers a fresh outlook on future research. One is providing a clear rationale for the model type and structure selection for a given ATM mission. Another is to understand what makes a specific architecture or algorithm effective for a given ATM mission. These are among the most important issues that will continue to attract the attention of the AI research community and ATM work teams in the future.

AB  - Objectives: This review analyzes the experiences of patients and clinicians with regards to international cross border reproductive care (CBRC) for the purpose of conception.Methods: Electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched using 'medical tourism' AND 'assisted reproductive technology' from 1978 to 2020.Results: Predominant patient motivators for CBRC were cost and legality of assisted reproduction technology (ART) in one's home country, followed by cultural factors like shared language, religion, and cultural familiarity. Clinicians suggested global laws for CBRC would reduce the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations but believed the enactment of international regulations unlikely and, even if enacted, difficult to enforce.Conclusions: While patient and clinician experiences with CBRC varied, patients frequently cited financial and legal reasons for pursuing CBRC, while many providers had concern for the patient's safety.Clinical practice implications: This review recommends clinicians involved in family planning counsel patients seeking treatment abroad by: (i) informing patients of the risks and benefits of treatment abroad, (ii) establishing guidelines and standards for clinicians on resuming patient care post-CBRC, and (iii) creating a directory of reputable CBRC clinicians and experts.

AB  - Big data (BD) is making advances in promoting sustainable consumption behaviour and has attracted the attention of researchers worldwide. Despite the increased focus, the findings of studies on this topic are fragmented, and future researchers need a systematic understanding of the existing literature for identification of the research scope. This study offers a systematic review of the role of BD in promoting sustainable-consumption behaviour with the help of a bibliometric analysis, followed by a thematic analysis. The findings suggest that businesses deploy BD to create sustainable consumer experiences, predict consumer buying patterns, design and alter business models and create nudges for sustainable consumption, while consumers are forcing businesses to develop green operations and supply chains to reduce the latter's carbon footprint. The major research gaps for future researchers are in the following areas: the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on consumerism, the role of BD in the formation of sustainable habits and consumer knowledge creation for sustainable consumption and prediction of green consumer behaviour.

AB  - Background: The use of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) for treatment of musculoskeletal disorders has become increasingly popular over the last several years, as technology has improved along with the need for better solutions for these pathologies. The use of cellular tissue raises a number of issues regarding the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation in classifying these treatments as a drug versus just autologous tissue transplantation. In the case of BMC in musculoskeletal and spine care, this determination will likely hinge on whether BMC is homologous to the musculoskeletal system and spine.
   Objectives: The aim of this review is to describe the current regulatory guidelines set in place by the FDA, specifically the terminology around "minimal manipulation" and "homologous use" within Regulation 21 CFR Part 1271, and specifically how this applies to the use of BMC in interventional musculoskeletal medicine.
   Methods: The methodology utilized here is similar to the methodology utilized in preparation of multiple guidelines employing the experience of a panel of experts from various medical specialties and subspecialties from differing regions of the world. The collaborators who developed these position statements have submitted their appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest. Trustworthy standards were employed in the creation of these position statements. The literature pertaining to BMC, its effectiveness, adverse consequences, FDA regulations, criteria for meeting the standards of minimal manipulation, and homologous use were comprehensively reviewed using a best evidence synthesis of the available and relevant literature.
   Results/Summary of Evidence: In conjunction with evidence-based medicine principles, the following position statements were developed:
   Statement 1: Based on a review of the literature in discussing the preparation of BMC using accepted methodologies, there is strong evidence of minimal manipulation in its preparation, and moderate evidence for homologous utility for various musculoskeletal and spinal conditions qualifies for the same surgical exemption.
   Statement 2: Assessment of clinical effectiveness based on extensive literature shows emerging evidence for multiple musculoskeletal and spinal conditions.
   The evidence is highest for knee osteoarthritis with level II evidence based on relevant systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies. There is level III evidence for knee cartilage conditions.
   Based on the relevant systematic reviews, randomized trials, and nonrandomized studies, the evidence for disc injections is level III.
   Based on the available literature without appropriate systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials, the evidence for all other conditions is level IV or limited for BMC injections.
   Statement 3: Based on an extensive review of the literature, there is strong evidence for the safety of BMC when performed by trained physicians with the appropriate precautions under image guidance utilizing a sterile technique.
   Statement 4: Musculoskeletal disorders and spinal disorders with related disability for economic and human toll, despite advancements with a wide array of treatment modalities.
   Statement 5: The 21st Century Cures Act was enacted in December 2016 with provisions to accelerate the development and translation of promising new therapies into clinical evaluation and use.
   Statement 6: Development of cell-based therapies is rapidly proliferating in a number of disease areas, including musculoskeletal disorders and spine. With mixed results, these therapies are greatly outpacing the evidence. The reckless publicity with unsubstantiated claims of beneficial outcomes having putative potential, and has led the FDA Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue multiple warnings. Thus the US FDA is considering the appropriateness of using various therapies, including BMC, for homologous use.
   Statement 7: Since the 1980's and the description of mesenchymal stem cells by Caplan et al, (now called medicinal signaling cells), the use of BMC in musculoskeletal and spinal disorders has been increasing in the management of pain and promoting tissue healing.
   Statement 8: The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) of the FDA requires minimal manipulation under same surgical procedure exemption. Homologous use of BMC in musculoskeletal and spinal disorders is provided by preclinical and clinical evidence.
   Statement 9: If the FDA does not accept BMC as homologous, then it will require an Investigational New Drug (IND) classification with FDA (351) cellular drug approval for use.
   Statement 10: This literature review and these position statements establish compliance with the FDA's intent and corroborates its present description of BMC as homologous with same surgical exemption, and exempt from IND, for use of BMC for treatment of musculoskeletal tissues, such as cartilage, bones, ligaments, muscles, tendons, and spinal discs.
   Conclusions: Based on the review of all available and pertinent literature, multiple position statements have been developed showing that BMC in musculoskeletal disorders meets the criteria of minimal manipulation and homologous use.

AB  - Solar energy has increased in its share of global electrical energy production. The increasing reliability of solar energy has positively affected the sustainability of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. A failure in any module in the plant can reduce or interrupt the production of electrical energy, causing significant losses in both efficiency and asset value. Therefore, responding to a fault as quickly as possible in a PV power plant is critical. The ability of the PV plant operator to react to potential faults is directly related to the rapid detection of faulty modules. In this paper, different PV monitoring systems in the literature are investigated extensively from the point of view of the devices and the techniques used to measure PV systems' current, voltage, solar radiation, and module temper-ature. In particular, the communication methods and data acquisition cards used in monitoring were examined. Remote monitoring technologies quickly detect the location of a malfunction in a large-scale power plant. In this context, traditional wire communication methods, today's communication technologies, and the low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) technologies used to monitor the performance of large and small-scale PV power plants are compared in detail. With the advancement of Internet of Things technologies such as Zigbee and LoRa, research on remote wireless monitoring of photovoltaic modules has accelerated in recent years. These technologies are projected to be widely deployed in the near future for the maintenance and fault detection of numerous photovoltaic installations.

AB  - Recurrent outbreaks of zoonotic infectious diseases highlight the importance of considering the interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health in disease prevention and control. This has given rise to the concept of One Health, which recognizes the interconnectedness of between human and animal health within their ecosystems. As a contribution to the One Health approach, this study aims to develop an indicator system to model the facilitation of the spread of zoonotic diseases. Initially, a literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to identify relevant indicators related to One Health. The selected indicators focused on demographics, socioeconomic aspects, interactions between animal and human populations and water bodies, as well as environmental conditions related to air quality and climate. These indicators were characterized using values obtained from the literature or calculated through distance analysis, geoprocessing tasks, and other methods. Subsequently, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques, specifically the Entropy and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods, were utilized to combine the indicators and create a composite metric for assessing the spread of zoonotic diseases. The final indicators selected were then tested against recorded zoonoses in the Valencian Community (Spain) for 2021, and a strong positive correlation was identified. Therefore, the proposed indicator system can be valuable in guiding the development of planning strategies that align with the One Health principles. Based on the results achieved, such strategies may prioritize the preservation of natural landscape features to mitigate habitat encroachment, protect land and water resources, and attenuate extreme atmospheric conditions.

AB  - Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, is significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. While countries have begun to ease restrictions and lockdowns, factors influencing the construction sector should be examined in light of COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the factors that impact Riyadh's construction sector in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. A systematic review of previous publications was conducted to develop a questionnaire to achieve the research goal, 67 valid copies of the questionnaire were received. The data were analyzed using reliability analysis and RII. Results factors were classified into four main groups (Managerial factors -Economic factors - Social and Cultural factors - Environmental Factors). The top factors affecting Riyadh's construction sector were Abandonment of talent and expertise by business owners during the pandemic period (Managerial group); Conflict in bidding prices by contractors due to the lack of projects offered due to the pandemic (Economic group); Customs, traditions and social relations in the areas in which the projects are implemented (Social and Cultural group); and The process of requesting raw materials, whether local or imported from abroad and its effects (Environmental group).

AB  - In recent times, the assessment of unsignalized intersection safety has received significant research attention because of the complex and diverse traffic movements and driving behaviour at such locations. However, priority traffic regulations are not well followed in comparison to the unsignalized junctions, which leads to more conflicts. Additionally, the severity of conflicts increases with continuous traffic manoeuvres, including rightturns and through traffic, combined with different driving behaviours. Several studies have compared crashbased analysis to proactive traffic safety measures. Current research outcomes imply that surrogate safety measures (SSMs) have the potential to elucidate the sequence of events that result in collisions, their underlying causes, and their outcomes. Therefore, to further understand the appropriateness of SSMs, further study is required based on heterogeneity in traffic along with driver behaviour that incorporates turning vehicle factors. This study presents an all-inclusive evaluation of the recent advancements in SSMs and their practical implementation, with a particular emphasis on unsignalized intersections in developing nations. The findings of this investigation would be helpful in identifying the appropriate safety indicators for evaluating traffic safety at unsignalized intersections.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the existing literature on the determinants of firms reporting practices. Design/methodology/approach Following a systematic method, the sample literature of 135 studies was collected from the Scopus database. These studies were evaluated in terms of the theoretical lenses applied in the literature, yearly trend, regional distribution, research settings and prior studies finding to provide some recommendations for further research. Findings The investigation revealed that the literature was more interested in the agency theory in investigating the drivers of voluntary reporting such as company size, age, leverage, liquidity, profitability, corporate governance and ownership structure. Although firm-specific determinants were the most examined in the previous studies, however, the result is still inconclusive. Also, limited work was found on the country-related factors, while internal audit impact has yet to be explored. Originality/value Being the first of its kind, this research provides a comprehensive review of the current research landscape on the drivers of environmental or social disclosure and highlights several interesting opportunities for future research.

AB  - Plant reproductive biology encompasses the study of sexual and asexual reproduction, as well as morphological, physiological, ecological, and genetic aspects influencing these processes. Management can influence reproduction of plants and associated attributes. For economically and culturally important species, it is known that exudates affect biomass of reproductive parts, but limited information is available on how reproductive biology is affected by harvest of exudates. This study reviews the effects of resins extraction in economic and culturally important species of Burseraceae. We conducted a systematic review on studies of floral biology, management, propagation and germination, resource allocation and pollination, hypothesizing that the extraction of exudates negatively impacts the reproductive biology of these plants by altering their mating system, pollination, and reproductive success as a consequence of resource reallocation. We identified that dioecy is the most frequent mating system in Burseraceae plants, and the extraction of exudates negatively affects the reproductive success of the species utilized, since it is related to a decrease in the number of flowers, fruits, and seeds, as well as in the percentage of viability and seed germination. Our review suggests the relevance of conducting studies on the ecophysiological effects of management on resiniferous species. Furthermore, it highlights the difficulty of detecting clear patterns, specific studies should be carried out to corroborate the hypothesis derived from this review. We propose specific strategies that better explore the effect of human management and exudate extraction techniques on vital processes such as germination, development, growth, reproduction, and pollination, in species that are used for this purpose.

AB  - Feeding the growing global population while improving the Earth's economic, environmental, and social values is a challenge recognised in both the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sustaining global agricultural performance requires regular revision of current farming models, attitudes, and practices. In systematically reviewing the international literature through the lens of the sustainability framework, this paper specifically identifies precision conservation agriculture (PCA), digital agriculture (DA), and resilient agriculture (RA) practices as being of value in meeting future challenges. Each of these adaptations carries significantly positive relationships with sustaining agricultural performance, as well as positively mediating and/or moderating each other. While it is clear from the literature that adopting PCA, DA, and RA would substantially improve the sustainability of agricultural performance, the uptake of these adaptations generally lags. More in-depth social science research is required to understand the value propositions that would encourage uptake of these adaptations and the barriers that prevent them. Recommendations are made to explore the specific knowledge gap that needs to be understood to motivate agriculture practitioners to adopt these changes in practice.

AB  - In Central Europe, ancient woodland sites with a long ecological continuity are regarded as especially valuable habitats and often stand out as biodiversity hotspots. This is particularly true for deciduous forests with over mature oak (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees, which are frequently parts of protected areas. But even before the term ecological continuity was introduced and the importance of over mature trees for biodiversity was widely recognized, there have been early 19th century approaches to protect veteran trees and deciduous woodland for aesthetical and historical reasons. With regard to forest birds and bats, already around 1800 utilitarian conservation efforts were made to protect species that were known to be natural enemies of arthropod pests. Already in those days forest scientists called for the preservation of old hollow trees for the purpose of protecting insectivorous birds and bats. Such trees became later known as habitat trees.
   The question arises, whether these early nature conservation ideas have been received or implemented by forest managers at that time. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the 19th century volumes (1825-1900) of the oldest continuously published scientific forestry journal worldwide, the Allgemeine Forstund Jagdzeitung (AFJZ). By evaluating 75 years of journal and forestry history, this study aimed at analyzing and discussing to what extent ideas and measures supporting ecological continuity and nature conservation were implemented in 19th century forest management.
   By reviewing the 19th century AFJZ volumes, it could be shown that the central topics appreciation and protection of veteran trees, and the protection of habitat trees and birds were regularly discussed. Both the temporal emphasis and the practical implementation of the different topics, however, varied considerably. While contributions dealing with veteran trees and their protection were most notably published between the 1820s and the 1850s, bird protection was a hot topic between the 1850s and the mid-1870s. The concept of habitat trees was occasionally mentioned between 1855 and 1900.
   Although systematic inventories of veteran trees were compiled in several Germans states and some trees were protected, general legal instructions for veteran tree protection were not enacted in the 19th century. The same is also true for the concept of habitat tree protection, which was known to foresters from journals and books already in the second half of the 19th century. Despite sporadic conservation efforts; rationalized forest management resulted in extensive losses of over-mature trees and, thereby, in a widespread disruption of ecological continuity. In Germany, however, the first systematic conservation network of forest nature reserves and natural monuments was established in Prussia from 1906 onwards.
   When looking at the perceived history of bird protection, the situation appears to be different. The legal protection of useful birds, which was primarily seen as an economic issue, was heavily lobbied by influential forest scientists. Their political efforts were directed towards both national and international bird protection. After the successful implementation of national legislation on bird protection in the 1880s, interest in the protection of birds faded among forest scientists. New nature conservation ideas, which went beyond utilitarian reasons for protecting birds, were more common among other middle-class intellectuals than among foresters. The loss of bird habitats due to forest management intensification, however, continued during the whole 19th century.

AB  - In this study a systematic literature review was carried out to analyze the characteristics, indicators, limitations, benefits, and conclusions of scientific productions on industrial sustainability to propose a set of generic sustainability indicators for industrial organizations. The identification of the scientific productions occurred through the use of key words, in addition, the snowballing technique was also used, which resulted in a final set of 24 papers from 1998 to 2018. The technique used to select the indicators was the text mining with the help of NVivo Software. Finally, the multiple advisor method was applied. The main results show that the studies on sets of indicators with a Triple Bottom Line approach began in 1998. In addition, the papers show studies that analyze the industries generally being published by journals with a high impact factor, with authors from universities in Europe, from America and Asia, which use an average set of 30 indicators, with the lowest percentage of studies using mixed and mixed-scale approaches. The limitations revealed by the papers are the lack of initiative and actions of organizations for the adoption of sustainability. The benefits are linked to the informational assistance they provide to managers in decision-making, and the conclusions reveal a lack of research on the use of the praxis of the set of sustainability indicators in industrial organizations. In this sense, we conclude that the set of indicators suggested in this study is in line with the theoretical findings of the reviewed literature, with a balance between the Triple Bottom Line aspects and the synthetic number of indicators that provide the ease of its application and analysis.

AB  - The food industry is facing crises, such as loss of habitat for biodiversity and poor working conditions for farm workers, as well as pressures, especially from external stakeholders, that are leading companies in the sector to move toward responsible sourcing. The literature on this topic has grown considerably over the last ten years and sheds light on the processes and practices for responsible sourcing that food companies have developed. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no systematic review has attempted to bring together this scattered literature. Based on 92 articles, this scoping review provides a comprehensive map of the current literature and highlights the main practices in this area. The findings show that critical aspects of responsible sourcing-such as supplier selection methods, the involvement of top management and the consideration of specific issues such as forced labor and diversity-are overlooked in the literature, while other issues are widely covered, such as collaborative relationships between companies and suppliers, certification and labeling, the development of new processes and products, and sustainable transport. This literature review can serve as a guide for all those interested in responsible sourcing practices. Interesting avenues for future research are suggested based on the literature review.

AB  - The possibility of using bioenergy as a climate change mitigation measure has sparked a discussion of whether and how bioenergy production contributes to sustainable development. We undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to illuminate this relationship and found a limited scientific basis for policymaking. Our results indicate that knowledge on the sustainable development impacts of bioenergy production is concentrated in a few well-studied countries, focuses on environmental and economic impacts, and mostly relates to dedicated agricultural biomass plantations. The scope and methodological approaches in studies differ widely and only a small share of the studies sufficiently reports on context and/or baseline conditions, which makes it difficult to get a general understanding of the attribution of impacts. Nevertheless, we identified regional patterns of positive or negative impacts for all categories - environmental, economic, institutional, social and technological. In general, economic and technological impacts were more frequently reported as positive, while social and environmental impacts were more frequently reported as negative (with the exception of impacts on direct substitution of GHG emission from fossil fuel). More focused and transparent research is needed to validate these patterns and develop a strong science underpinning for establishing policies and governance agreements that prevent/mitigate negative and promote positive impacts from bioenergy production.

AB  - Background: Streamlining patient pathways within health care systems is a complex and challenging process. While frontline clinicians often have an abundance of ideas, these rarely translate into real-world change due to nonadoption or early abandonment. Objectives: The aim of this article is to provide frontline clinicians with a blueprint for developing a business case for a streamlined pathway while guiding the practical implementation of this blueprint. Methods: The key steps outlined in streamlining a patient pathway are as follows: step 1-identify problems with the patient pathway; step 2-identify the potential to streamline; step 3-forecast the benefits of the streamlined pathway; step 4-gain approvals; step 5-plan the practicalities; step 6-implement and monitor the streamlined pathway; and step 7-monitor the streamlined pathway. Within these steps, Lean management techniques are introduced (including value stream mapping, Pareto charts, Ishikawa diagrams, demand and capacity calculations, role lane mapping) and strengthened by other methods (retrospective audit, systematic review, patient questionnaires, and cost analysis). Results: This roadmap is contextualized using a case study, demonstrating how streamlining pathways can result in statistically significant reductions in referral to treatment time, the number of steps in the pathway, lead time (pathway duration), and handoff (transfer of patients between health care professionals). This can be achieved while increasing patient contact time, improving patient satisfaction, and reducing costs. Conclusion: This blueprint demonstrates a comprehensive method for streamlining patient pathways, using Lean management techniques complemented by additional methods. This approach was developed by frontline clinicians and can be replicated by others, translating quality improvement ideas into sustainable change in practice. It enables the design of streamlined pathways that confer significant benefits to patients, health care service providers, and the health economy.

AB  - Urban sustainability is the goal of many cities in the world, yet very few have achieved a level of sustainability that goes beyond the most basic environmental objectives. The practice and assessment of sustainability implementation are greatly compounded by lack of funding, technical know-how, political will, and the power disparity between dominant institutions and marginalized communities. This systematic analysis of urban sus-tainability literature involved the review of 241 studies published between 2010 and 2022. We critically examined current debates and challenges in urban sustainability, identifying gaps and opportunities and providing recommendations for creating equitable, just, and sustainable urban futures. We also reviewed 23 studies to summarize the social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) indicators used to measure urban sustainability in the same period, many of which may not be relevant to the lived experiences of marginalized communities. To move toward more meaningful and equitable pathways, it is important to develop SETS in-dicators of urban sustainability that are reflective of the experiences and priorities of diverse groups in society. This review identifies four major issues in the current urban sustainability literature: space, scale, stakeholders, and dimension. These issues need to be centered in sustainability planning in order to develop solutions that are appropriate for the local context.

AB  - This article reviews the previously published studies on sustainable heritage cities, and to derive lessons for further research. The research method used is document analysis. A total of 30 journal articles from leading databases published in the five (5) years (2016-2020) were selected using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The results of the analysis can be broken down into the purpose of the study, methodology, selection of indicators and study area used in previous studies. The purpose of the past studies was to lead towards the development of sustainable heritage cities by using five (5) key measurement indicators: (1) economic, (2) social, (3) environmental, (4) cultural heritage, and (5) institution. The study area is divided into three (3) types: (1) city (urban area), (2) historical site, and (3) heritage building. However, there are still some research gaps in this field, such as methodology, indicator and study areas that need to be filled by future research. The vacancies left in this study will be the focus of future researchers to make the study in this field more impactful and holistic. The implications of this study can help the development of sustainable heritage cities, in keeping with the 2030 Agenda (Agenda, 2030).

AB  - The first and last mile (FLM) problem is the lack of adequate connectivity between transit stations and trip origins/destinations. Consequently, this problem increases the probability of driving private cars directly to the destinations and reduces the patronage of public transit. For appealing the use of sustainable transport for accessing public transit, it is imperative to identify the factors influencing FLM travel mode choice. This review synthesizes the empirical FLM literature and identifies the key factors that influence FLM travel mode choice including conventional factors (e.g. socio-demographic characteristics and built environments); exogenous factors that can reduce the appeal of sustainable FLM transport (e.g. crime and weather); and unique factors related to emerging transport and informal public transit. From these findings, we chart a future FLM research agenda under three thematic areas: (1) theory for enhancing the understanding of FLM travel mode choice; (2) data and modeling approaches for discussing the feasibility of using emerging data sources and providing modeling avenues to progress; (3) policy and practice for encouraging the use of sustainable travel for FLM.

AB  - This research analyzes professional and research efforts to correlate heritage architecture and historical archeology. The Historical Center of Cuenca is used as a case study, an urban segment that, due to its socio-cultural particularities and local processes undertaken, has ample technical and scientific potential to account for the importance of this relationship. Methodologically, the analysis uses a systematic review of the technical reports on prospecting, excavation and intervention carried out between 2008 and 2011 by the Urban Archeology Unit (UAU) and other binding technical and administrative documents. For the study, analytical sheets that synthesize practices, disciplinary relationships and research projections are used. As a result, the low level of interdisciplinary cohesion in the practices, mechanisms and scope of said project is appreciated. In fact, the approach of the 34 goods is framed in the excavation, at the same time, ceramics found denotes as the identified and documented cultural material; other of pre-Hispanic origin have been minimized without discarding their historical interest. This concludes that the basic parameters, management strategies and socialization of heritage are minimal; Archeology has been a means of legitimizing intervention in monumental entities, and it has rarely been a means of integral management. The UAU experience allows to identify complementary disciplinary fields and to propose a roadmap articulated to the professional and research framework for its application in heritage assets with archaeological potential.

AB  - The relationship between humans and the environment in the modern world is challenging. UNESCO Global Geoparks are current holistic approaches for protecting and managing geographical areas that emphasise local communities and sustainability. This paper attempts to review the grey literature of Greek universities through their academic repositories, regarding the research field referred to as Greek UNESCO Global Geoparks from 2000 to 2022 and using the keyword "Geopark" to determine possible future research directions. Through the systematic literature review methodology, from 138 bibliographic sources, 28 were selected, which met the predefined criteria. In general, there is a growing scientific-academic interest in Geoparks, which mainly concerns the aspects of geotourism (n = 7), geology (n = 6), management (n = 4), and education (n = 4). Future research directions may focus on promoting the socio-economic and cultural aspects of Geoparks, investing in collaborative management and governance of Geoparks, facing climate change and environmental challenges in Geoparks, and enhancing Geoenvironmental Education in Geoparks. Such approaches may serve the United Nation's Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals and cultivate cognitive and emotional bonds between local populations and the geoenvironment.

AB  - Animals play a profoundly important and intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands of years, but now they work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock, and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitats. There are many reasons, including societal and economic ones, to explore how new computing technologies can be used to ensure the welfare of animals in these settings. The goal of this review is to systematically survey the existing literature in smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm, and wild animal welfare. We use a broad notion of animal welfare to refer to an assessment of whether animals are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and positively stimulated in their environment. Smart computing and sensing is also used in broad terms, to refer to systems that are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of remote data collection, processing, exchange, and analysis. The findings of this review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering, as well as contribute to data, information, and communication management for animal welfare.

AB  - Purpose Understanding policy consequences for cities is very important in an urban setting, especially in this era of developing solutions for grand challenges. Climate change adaptation and smart cities are emerging topics in the climate change and sustainability domain. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve a better understanding of policy consequences and exploring synergies of climate change adaptation and smart cities are valuable for both research and practice. Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews synergies of smart city applications in urban climate change adaptation literature. A systematic literature review and content analysis are carried out to answer the research questions and a theoretically based smart cities concept matrix with synergetic coproduction theory is used to assess the empirical studies. Findings Key findings are that the model of synergetic coproduction could identify the benefits co-existing in smart city and climate change adaptation. While smart people and smart government play the fundamental roles, synergies could co-occur in other smart city dimensions. Smart city applications in climate change adaptation could increase competitiveness in cities by exploiting the opportunities as well as reducing the harmful risks.
   Originality/value This study combines two emerging topics in the assessment, climate change adaptation and smart cities, and represents a new way of assessing literature and possibly policy outcomes for the cities. By using the theoretical framework from smart cities and theory of coproduction, a theory-based framework is developed for assessing the empirical studies of climate adaptation in cities. The findings from the systematic literature review indicate relations among smart city dimensions in a clear manner and also identify the synergies of smart cities and climate adaptation.

AB  - The main purpose of the paper is to espouse the policy promptings of climate change and food security-based researches that would lend appropriate solutions to avert the risks of food insecurity, due to climate variability and change in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design and methodological approach used a systematic review of preponderantly existing research findings. The paper discussed within the context of systematic discourse analysis, policy research uptake dynamics for food production and climate variability and change in SSA. The results indicated that the threats of adverse impacts of climate change are expected to be higher on Sub-Saharan Africa's food systems, notwithstanding, little effort is given to the implementation of policy recommendation by sub-Saharan African countries' agriculture sectors. This paper further argues broadly that there is still growing levels of policy implementation ambivalence towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 13, which enjoins nations to take immediate action to combat climate change through the institutionalization of sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies, among many Sub-Saharan African countries. Government departments of food and agriculture, as well as meteorological agencies, require proactive inter-sectorial responses and collaboration to address the scourge of climate variability and change in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa. The paper recommends prompt and dispassionate implementation of climate change policies, as an imperative need for sustainable food production systems, in response to changing climatic patterns in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Featured Application Potential application in innovations and management sciences, strategy for sustainable development. Combating chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats with novel solutions reduces disasters and accident risks and, at the same time, aids sustainability. This research aims to identify the innovations in combating CBRN threats and verify how they fall within the scope of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The study relies on mixed-method research, including bibliometrics and text-mining used to identify clusters, most frequent words, and codes. The material for the research was 156 publications from the Scopus database from 2017 to April 2022. From the analytical process, textual data served as the indicators of the innovations' directions driven by SDGs. The research results indicated that innovations for combating CBRN threats support sustainability mainly in health and environmental areas, specifically in: SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 14: Life Below Water; SDG 15: Life On Land. The research contributes to the landscape of innovations serving sustainable development. Further studies may focus on narrower perspectives, such as environmental protection and health innovations. There can also be concerns about the dark side of CBRN innovations and technologies of dual use.

AB  - The coffee sector is working towards sector-wide commitments for sustainable production. Yet, knowledge of where coffee is cultivated and its environmental impact remains limited, in part due to the challenges of mapping coffee using satellite remote sensing. We recognize the urgency to capitalize on recent technological advances to improve remote sensing methods and generate more accurate, reliable, and scalable approaches to coffee mapping. In this study, we provide a systematic review of satellite-based approaches to mapping coffee extent, which produced 43 articles in the peer-reviewed and gray literature. We outline key considerations for employing effective approaches, focused on the need to balance data affordability and quality, classification complexity and accuracy, and generalizability and site-specificity. We discuss research opportunities for improved approaches by leveraging the recent expansion of diverse satellite sensors and constellations, optical/Synthetic Aperture Radar data fusion approaches, and advances in cloud computing and deep learning algorithms. We highlight the need for differentiating between production systems and the need for research in important coffee-growing geographies. By reviewing the range of techniques successfully used to map coffee extent, we provide technical recommendations and future directions to enable accurate and scalable coffee maps.

AB  - Sustainable development is first defined as development that satisfies the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy theirs. Sustainable development is possible if conditions of respect for the environment, preventing the exhaustion of natural resources and preserving the overall balance, are fulfilled. The necessity of the development and maintenance of habitats also emphasized. Construction processes have important role in creation of built environment and their impacts have to be measured as construction contributes to air pollution, land use and contamination, usage of resources, water and materials depletion, water pollution, impacts on human health, and climate change. Previous (own) research revealed, that the key categories of Web of Science, which encompass the research on the sustainable built environment, cover construction and building technologies, environmental science and studies, and civil engineering. The article presents a review of the literature on efforts to harmonize the construction processes, which was made on the basis of the Web of Science Core Collection database. The analysis of the number of publications was made according to years of publication and research areas. To honour the contribution made by Prof Oleg Kaplinski in the field of Sustainable Development and Decision-Making, and to commemorate his 75th anniversary, this article also highlights his academic career and research.

AB  - Automation and real-time control have long been used in urban wastewater systems. However, there is a critical need to review how real-time control contributes to sustainable water management. This review provides a systematic review of the role of real-time control towards creating a sustainable wastewater system. This review identifies the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainability that can be achieved using automation and control systems, considering individual systems and different scales of integration. Results obtained from a systematic literature review show that previous research on automation and control related to sustainability in the water sector focuses on addressing economic issues (mainly operational cost reduction) and improving the quality of the water environment, while the social pillar of sustainability is not addressed to a significant degree. Integrated control is identified as a promising approach to address the three pillars of sustainability. Future research on automaton and real-time control in the water and wastewater system needs to explicitly demonstrate the contribution of control strategies towards the attributes of sustainability. To this end, regulatory bodies should focus on creating an overarching sustainability framework with indicators of sustainability clearly defined. Further, addressing three pillars of sustainability requires an integrated approach at a catchment scale where upstream and downstream processes are considered.

AB  - Water is a vital and multifunctional resource for our society, economy and ecosystems; thus, how water is managed now and into the future has wide-reaching consequences. Sustainable water management and environmental justice therefore become key topics; a discussion of these terms is explored in the context of the UK water industry, which provides the focus for this study. This systematic review explores how considerations of the future have been applied in water research. The literature is reviewed with respect to (1) defining the end goal, (2) the use of futures analysis and (3) possible evaluation methods, including a discussion on the boundaries applied to each of the studies. A growing body of research associated with decision-making applying future scenarios was identified. However, the methods of application varied substantially, with holistic analyses largely lacking. The formulation of methods appears to be specific to the goal that is sought as well as the cultural influence of the region in which the analysis was developed and deployed. This paper presents a case for the visualisation of catchment characteristics and interdependencies to enable transparency in decision-making. This should reflect not only the current system but also a range of potential futures to enable appraisal of impacts.

AB  - Traceability information as a solution option becomes an important task for the industry in providing products, preparing sustainable raw materials, and ensuring adequate safety quality. The emergence of these demands makes the industry perform tracking in order to prepare product inventories ranging from raw materials to products that have been produced. Based on these reasons, the scope of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature on various aspects of implementing information traceability models and sustainability of supply chain on economic, social, environmental, technological, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions. For this purpose, we use the Scopus, Science Direct, EBSCO Host, and ProQuest databases. We used the PRISMA model to identify, filter, and test for the eligibility of articles to be included. We selected 52 articles contributed by this search engine. We found was that between 2018 to 2021 there was increasing interest in this research. The dominant traceability information model in the article uses blockchain, the rest use operations research (OR), Google Earth Engine (GEE), website-based, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), physical markup language (PML), logit, enterprise resource planning (ERP), soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA), and Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems (SEI-PCS).

AB  - Background: Forest harvesting changes forest habitat and impacts forest dependent species. Uneven-aged management is often considered better for biodiversity than even-aged management, but there is an ongoing discourse over the benefits and disadvantages of different silvicultural systems. This systematic review contributes to the public discussion and provides evidence for policy making by synthesising current evidence on impacts of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on biodiversity in boreal forests of Fennoscandia and European Russia. In this review even-aged and uneven-aged forest management are compared directly to each other as well as to natural forest to provide a broad basis for public discussion.
   Methods: Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in bibliographical databases, organizational webpages and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened for relevance by their title/abstract and again by full text. The inclusion of studies was assessed against pre-defined criteria published in an a priori protocol. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted to describe the evidence base and to compare species richness and abundance between differently managed forests. The influence of habitat specialism, taxon, years since harvesting, deadwood availability and harvesting intensity on species richness and abundance were also tested.
   Review findings: Searching identified 43,621 articles of which 137 articles with 854 studies had independent data and were included in the narrative synthesis. Of those, 547 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The most studied taxa were arthropods, vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, and lichens. Results showed that forests with less disturbance (uneven-aged and mature even-aged) host more forest dependent species than young even-aged forests (< 80 years old) although the difference was only marginally significant for mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old). Uneven-aged forest had similar number of species and individuals than natural forest whereas even-aged forest had less species than natural forest. Open habitat species and their individuals were more numerous in young even-aged forests and forests undergone retention harvest. Effect sizes found were mostly large indicating strong and uniform impact of forest management based on species' habitat preferences. In addition to habitat specialism, years since harvest explained some of the differences found in species richness and abundance due to increase of open habitat species in the early successional stages and forest dependent species in late successional stages. Taxon had limited explanatory power.
   Conclusions: Habitat preferences determine species' response to different harvesting methods and the magnitude of effect is large. Less disturbance from harvesting is better for forest dependent species whereas opposite is true for open habitat species. Uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (> 80 years old) are important to maintain biodiversity in boreal forests. However, the results also highlight that natural forests are needed to ensure the future of forest dependent species in Fennoscandia and European Russia. Given that a broader set of biodiversity aspects are to be protected, best overall biodiversity impacts for a variety of species at landscape level can be achieved by ensuring that there is a mosaic of different forests within landscapes.

AB  - Knowledge society points out that people are of great importance to organizations, since they are the ones who have knowledge, mostly considered tacit, and essential to develop strategies that aimed at increasing competitiveness and yield. So, searching for valuing diverse knowledge has become increasingly dynamic in all knowledge areas. The modernization process of agriculture intervened on how farmers' crop, which, based on a reductionist viewpoint, aimed at homogenizing yield decision-making, according to technical-scientific knowledge, disregarding the traditional knowledge from rural communities. During the last years, studies have shown the importance of adopting interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches, with some concern on sustainable development, involving different kinds of knowledge. Thus, the study aims at analyzing the process of local or traditional knowledge management in family farming context and other rural populations in order to improve sustainable rural development, based on a systematic review of the literature. The databases used for this research were: web of Science, Scopus, Capes and BDTD. The search results came from the following continents: Meridional Asia, Southeastern Asia, Western Europe, Southern America and Oceania. The studies have shown that according to the literature and academic area, in recent years, there was some development on traditional knowledge. Therefore, in real life, there still have few measures that stimulate the dialogue among scientific-techniques and local or traditional knowledge.

AB  - The production of science has generally been understood as primarily a technical endeavor, conducted by a narrow group of knowledge "experts" who ostensibly bring legitimacy and rigor to the process. In recent decades, the speed with which global environmental change has unfolded has pressured the sci-entific community to engage a broader set of actors in the production of knowledge to inform decision -making. Indeed, calls for societal engagement in the "co-production" of knowledge have proliferated in environmental and natural resource governance, climate adaptation, and land system science scholar-ship, among many others. We conduct a systematic review of scholarship focused on collaborative engagement between scientists and decision-makers to better understand the nature of stakeholder engagement in science production processes. We analyze collaborative knowledge generation within research that conceptualizes it as co-production and transdisciplinarity. We explore how stakeholders are defined, the processes by which stakeholders are engaged, the societal impacts associated with stake-holder engagement, and the barriers and enablers to stakeholder engagement. We uncover a diverse body of scholarship from around the world that cuts across many environmental issues, and highlights chal-lenges in stakeholder engagement related to unequal and unmitigated power relations. We conclude with a set of recommendations related to how researchers engage in and report on stakeholder engage-ment in co-production processes. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is monitored using a set of targets and indicators. Gaps in official datasets have led to calls for the inclusion of data generated through citizen science (CS) and allied approaches. Co-benefits of CS mean these approaches could also contribute to localising, defining, and achieving the SDGs. However, mapping of current and potential contributions is needed, as well as an understanding of the challenges these approaches present. We undertake a semi-systematic review of past and current CS projects and assess them against dimensions of CS-spatial, temporal, thematic, process, and management-and their value for the SDGs set out by Fritz et al. in 2019, focusing on low and middle income country (LMIC) cities as key environments in the battle for sustainability. We conduct interviews with project leaders to further understand the challenges for CS in these contexts. We find opportunities for projects to monitor and achieve a wide range of goals, targets, and indicators. However, we find fewer projects in low income countries when compared with middle income countries. Challenges include balancing local needs with national monitoring requirements and a lack of long-term funding. Support is needed for LMICs to achieve the potential of CS.

AB  - In the last three decades, relevant research has rapidly increased in tandem with the global popularity of TOD (transit-oriented development) initiatives. It is vital to thoroughly summarize this research and investigate its development trends for sustainable cities. The advent of bibliometrics has given rise to a new method of conducting systematic reviews. We wish to illustrate the evolution of the TOD field by applying scientometrics, with the aim of revealing trends in this field and establishing a scientific classification system. We employ visualization software such as VOSviewer and CiteSpace to conduct bibliometric analyses on TOD-related publications from the WOS database from 1994 to 2021. Potential TOD-related research hotspots and cutting-edge research trends are thoroughly examined. The results indicate that TOD research topics are diverse, with hot topics related to land use, built environment, travel behavior, etc. The regions studied in TOD research are mostly metropolitan areas. Based on a modest number of starting keywords, this strategy can be used to build a more relevant and deeper research network. Through expanding the research content and improving research methods, this paper can provide insights into identifying the evolution of TOD research in different locations of the world, as well as provide a reference for the application and implementation of TOD strategies.

AB  - Sustainable development aims to address economic, social, and environmental imperatives; yet, in practice, it often embodies a neoliberal market logic that reinforces inequalities. Thus, as the social work profession grapples with its role in advancing environmental sustainability, practice models must explicitly attend to social and economic justice. For example, environmental gentrification refers to situations in which the cleanup of contaminated land or the installation of environmental amenities intentionally or unintentionally catalyzes increased housing costs, thereby contributing to the displacement of vulnerable residents. With the goal of contributing to practice knowledge, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles (1997-2017) to learn how community groups have responded to the threat of environmental gentrification. We found that community organizations employ a range of strategies, including blocking development, negotiating for protections, planning alternatives, and allying with gentrifiers. We conclude by exploring ethical implications and practice principles to help social workers engage in truly sustainable development.
   Key Practitioner Message: center dot The term environmental gentrification describes situations where improvements to environmental quality increase real estate prices, contributing to the displacement of vulnerable residents; center dot An environmental justice framework attending to procedural, distributional, and recognition-based claims provides a model for social work practice; center dot Opportunities exist for social workers to take an intersectional rather than siloed approach to integrate economic, social, and environmental concerns.

AB  - Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the area of Natural Language Processing that aims to extract human perceptions, thoughts, and beliefs from unstructured textual content. It has become a useful, attractive, and challenging research area concerning the emergence and rise of social media and the mass volume of individuals' reviews, comments, and feedback. One of the major problems, apparent and evident in social media, is the toxic online textual content. People from diverse cultural backgrounds and beliefs access Internet sites, concealing and disguising their identity under a cloud of anonymity. Due to users' freedom and anonymity, as well as a lack of regulation governed by social media, cyber toxicity and bullying speech are major issues that need an automated system to be detected and prevented. There is diverse research in different languages and approaches in this area, but the lack of a comprehensive study to investigate them from all aspects is tangible. In this manuscript, a comprehensive multi-lingual and systematic review of cyber-hate sentiment analysis is presented. It states the definition, properties, and taxonomy of cyberbullying and how often each type occurs. In addition, it presents the most recent popular cyberbullying benchmark datasets in different languages, showing their number of classes (Binary/Multiple), discussing the applied algorithms, and how they were evaluated. It also provides the challenges, solutions, as well as future directions.

AB  - Background: Many of the known solutions to the physical inactivity pandemic operate across sectors relevant to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Methods: The authors examined the contribution of physical activity promotion strategies toward achieving the SDGs through a conceptual linkage exercise, a scoping review, and an agent-based model. Results: Possible benefits of physical activity promotion were identified for 15 of the 17 SDGs, with more robust evidence supporting benefits for SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 13 (climate action), and 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions). Current evidence supports prioritizing atscale physical activity-promoting transport and urban design strategies and community-based programs. Expected physical activity gains are greater for low-and middle-income countries. In high-income countries with high car dependency, physical activity promotion strategies may help reduce air pollution and traffic-related deaths, but shifts toward more active forms of travel and recreation, and climate change mitigation, may require complementary policies that disincentivize driving. Conclusions: The authors call for a synergistic approach to physical activity promotion and SDG achievement, involving multiple sectors beyond health around their goals and values, using physical activity promotion as a lever for a healthier planet.

AB  - Major cities in Europe have seen a significant increase in micromobility infrastructure, including cycling infrastructure, with 42 European Metropolitan cities implementing 1421.54 km of cycling infrastructure in a year. However, the design principles for bikeways primarily rely on conventional road design for bicycles and lack consistency in accommodating emerging powered micromobility devices like e-scooters. To address this research gap, this paper conducts a systematic review and scientometric analysis to explore safe bikeway infrastructure design. It identifies three overlooked topics (marking and signing, grading, and mode choice) and nine understudied areas (vibration, distress, skidding, alignment features, clearance, lateral control, connectivity, traffic composition, and intersection presence) that significantly impact micromobility safety. The study's comprehensive understanding and use of scientometric tools reveal patterns and relationships within the literature. It also highlights criteria influencing micromobility safety and the need for research on pavement and user behavior. The findings contribute to evidence-based decision-making for practitioners and researchers, emphasizing the importance of tailored infrastructure design to enhance micromobility safety and achieve cost-effective improvements.

AB  - Cycling has the potential to address a number of personal and societal challenges, not least with respect to health and the need for more sustainable modes of transport. However, the best way(s) to promote cycling is still unclear. In an effort to answer this question, we identified 39 interventions designed to promote cycling, with a total sample of 46,102 participants. Random effects meta-analysis estimated a small but statistically significant effect of interventions on cycling behaviour (g(+) = 0.14, 95% CI [0.05, 0.23]). To identify the most effective intervention strategies, we coded the behaviour change techniques used within each of the interventions. Interventions that prompted people to self-monitor their behaviour or added objects to the environment (e.g., provided shared bikes) were more effective than those that did not use these strategies. Interventions that restructured the physical environment (e.g., built new cycle paths) were less effective than the studies that did not do this. We also identified a number of factors that moderated the effect of the interventions on outcomes; specifically, interventions that targeted a specific group, used objective measures of cycling such as accelerometers, and that were tested using independent groups designs typically yielded stronger effects. The findings should help to guide interventions to promote cycling in the future.

AB  - Considering the importance of the road freight transport sector on the sustainability debate, the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the road freight transport literature to provide key information on the role that this field of knowledge must play in contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To accomplish this, we performed a state-of-the-art review via systematic literature on 86 documents published during 2015-2020, with an emphasis on environmental, economic, and technical studies. Ultimately, this paper seeks to uncover research gaps and to suggest means in which the freight transport literature and the 17 SDGs may be faced by this field in future studies. the results showed that the SDGs were not target by the analyzed papers, and the sustainable development goals were not quoted at all. The only SDG fully contemplated was number 7-affordable and clean energy. The findings of this study suggest that this field should add research of SDGs 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 17 as priority areas to be further developed by the RFT literature to achieve SDGs goals.

AB  - Drawing on the development and implementation of a facilitated transdisciplinary research process in the case of the red meat industry in Ireland, this paper provides a framework by which diverse knowledge sources can be brought together to develop pathways for the circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, through identifying, analysing and evaluating a large number of value chains using this framework (involving a systematic review of academic literature, a grey literature review, an industry survey and a Delphi study), it presents a pathway for the uti-lisation of meat co-processing streams across several sectors. It highlights the value of grey literature as a complement to the academic literature (identifying almost four times as many value chain opportunities as the academic literature). Furthermore, it illustrates the wide-ranging knowledge that a relatively small group of experts (25) can provide in a short period time to help assess the feasibility of a manageable number of value chains (14 in this case). As this case study is framed around an ambition to develop a roadmap for industry in valorising meat industry co-products, the authors draw attention to the role of industry in providing knowledge but also influencing the direction of the work, and hence the results. Thus it indicates the need to consider other voices in such processes where broader sustainability objectives are at play.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to provide a systematic review of the literature on destination competitiveness. It explores research themes and approaches, and outlines an agenda for future research.Design/methodology/approach - One hundred and eighty-three journal articles on destination competitiveness published in English since 2010 were collected. Content analysis was performed.Findings - The authors found that sustainable development and smart tourism were popular themes related to destination competitiveness. Recent studies still relied heavily on Ritchie and Crouch's (2000) model or Dwyer and Kim's (2003) model. The authors also offer constructive insights for future research, proposing that research seek more input from residents, take an advanced integrated approach between supply and demand, adopt more core theories, focus on less researched types of destinations, explore the further contribution of smart tourism and adopt a negative lens to study the antecedents and consequences of destination competitiveness. The adoption of a longitudinal study approach is also suggested.Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature because of the scope of its review and perspective of discussion. Previous review papers have only focused on the factors and indicators of tourism destination competitiveness in different settings. We extend our literature review to research themes and approaches, and make suggestions for future research directions.

AB  - Different dynamics of climate change, population growth, and urbanisation challenge water service providers (WSPs) and those managing urban planning. The scientific community has been evidencing the concept of sustainable urban water management (SUWM) as a driver to foster the integration of the urban water cycle with its environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions. This article studies the approaches addressed by recent research on sustainable urban water management, focusing on the attention given by the scientific community to the way WSPs and city planners address the new challenges brought by climate change. A systematic review of existing literature shows how emergent challenges address the articulation between urban water cycle management and city planning. The results underline the need for the technical and economic evaluation of the overarching concept of SUWM systems, integrating values that go beyond financial issues; the need to address water scarcity not only from the supply side but also from the demand point of view; and the deepening of the relationship between new sources of water, such as the reuse, with the city planning in a context of climate change. Nevertheless, strategies for collaboration are still poorly addressed. The insights and gaps emerging from the analysis suggest new paths for research and practice in the field.

AB  - Increasing concern about food waste and the consequences of human lifestyle on the environment have intensified attention on this topic. While waste and loss of food occur in all stages of the food chain, more than 50% of the blame relies on the consumers' shoulders, regardless of their geographical location, age, culture, or historical roots. Ideally, wasted food (from agricultural production to storage and transportation stages, down to final consumers) should return to the habitat it came from (circular economy concept), but man-made materials do not naturally decompose quickly, or they decompose in several hundreds of years, destroying untouched resources. Simply presented, reducing lost or wasted food means more food for us all in the future, more visible economic growth (especially in low-income countries), and less pressure on the environment. While these concepts are largely being investigated in Western economies, Eastern Europe lacks a proper understanding, especially in the best relevant practices. Therefore, this systematic review highlights the need for further research on Eastern European households' attitudes and the importance of identifying long-term trends in changing behaviour causing wastage. This can only be done properly if past experiences, societal culture, traditions, and food habits are mirrored in future predictions by considering the inherent factors influencing the decision-making process.

AB  - Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Changes in precipitation and temperature patterns will result in long-term declines in production and short-term crop failures. These short- and long-run impacts are projected to be particularly severe in developing countries because of high exposure to climate change impacts and dependence on rain-fed agriculture. To overcome the challenges of a changing climate on agricultural production in West Africa, farmers implement a range of adaptation strategies. Using a systematic review of spatial-temporal empirical literature published on climate change adaptation in the West African ecological region and data collected from semi-structure interviews to farmers, we identified adaptation strategies in West Africa and explored their efficiency computing their cost-benefit ratio to examine farmers' private returns per dollar spent. Our results show that 91 adaptation strategies are employed by farmers in the sub-region, classified into six categories: cultural practices, forest management strategies, land management practices, water management strategies, risk management strategies and the use of improved technologies. Our results show that planting of trees, increased use of fertilizers, use of resistant varieties, mixed farming and crop diversification are the strategies that generate the highest returns, with highest annual mean net benefits. Mulching was also found a financial attractive as it generates the greatest returns per dollar spent ($3.2) and internal rate of return due to its low associated cost. The adaptation options that generate net mean annual losses were water harvesting, erosion control and making of big mounds. In a scenario with a 10% annual increase in annual benefits and costs over a period of five years, all the adaptation strategies, apart from water harvesting, will yield positive net present value benefits for the farmers. Since any climate change adaptation will inevitably have heterogenous financial implications to farmers, result from this study sheds light on farmers' private incentives to embark on adaptation strategies and provides information needed for decision support on adaptation measures choice selection, policy and planning across the sub region with relevance to other areas.

AB  - This paper explores the role of learning in organizational responses to sustainability. Finding meaningful solutions to sustainability challenges requires companies and other actors to broaden their thinking, go beyond organizational boundaries and engage more with their stakeholders. However, broadening organizational perspective and collaborating with diverse stakeholders involves inherent political and process-related tensions. Learning has been identified as a key organizing process for overcoming the challenges that arise through collaborative action for sustainability. In order to understand the role of learning in organizational responses to sustainability, we conduct a cross-disciplinary systematic review of the literature on learning for sustainability and incorporate perspectives from diverse disciplines including business, management, environmental science, sociology, policy, urban planning, and development. The review explores how different disciplines conceptualize and operationalize learning for sustainability and identifies the common themes and challenges. Our findings highlight the different ways that power relations influence learning and decision-making processes, and how entrenched traditional value structures and 'reflexive complicity' limit practitioners and researchers alike in finding meaningful sustainability solutions. We conclude that shifting how we motivate business and management research on learning for sustainability, in a way that prioritizes sustainability outcomes over firm performance, could bring us a step closer to more meaningful responses to sustainability. Similarly, breaking patterns of 'reflexive complicity' by key actors in business could assist in shifting toward more radical and long-term responses to sustainability in practice.

AB  - The role of governance has been receiving increasing attention from food security scholars in recent years. However, in spite of the recognition that governance matters, current knowledge of food security governance is rather fragmented. To provide some clarity in the debate about the role of governance in addressing food (in)security, this paper reports the results of a systematic review of the literature. The synthesis revolves around seven recurring themes: i) the view of governance as both a challenge and solution to food security; ii) a governability that is characterized by high degrees of complexity; iii) failures of the current institutional architectures; iv) the arrival of new players at the forefront; v) calls for coherency and coordination across multiple scales; vi) variation and conflict of ideas; and vii) calls for the allocation of sufficient resources and the integration of democratic values in food security governance. Two lines of discussion of this synthesis are raised. First, the researcher argues that a large proportion of the food security governance literature is characterized by an optimist governance perspective, i.e., a view of governance as a problem-solving mechanism. Complementing this body of literature with alternative governance perspectives in future research may strengthen current understandings of food security governance. Approaching food security as a 'wicked problem' could provide valuable insights in this respect. Second, food security governance as a research field could make headway by engaging in further empirical investigation of current governance arrangements, particularly at sub-national levels.

AB  - Modern and precision agriculture is constantly evolving, and the use of technology has become a critical factor in improving crop yields and protecting plants from harmful insects and pests. The use of neural networks is emerging as a new trend in modern agriculture that enables machines to learn and recognize patterns in data. In recent years, researchers and industry experts have been exploring the use of neural networks for detecting harmful insects and pests in crops, allowing farmers to act and mitigate damage. This paper provides an overview of new trends in modern agriculture for harmful insect and pest detection using neural networks. Using a systematic review, the benefits and challenges of this technology are highlighted, as well as various techniques being taken by researchers to improve its effectiveness. Specifically, the review focuses on the use of an ensemble of neural networks, pest databases, modern software, and innovative modified architectures for pest detection. The review is based on the analysis of multiple research papers published between 2015 and 2022, with the analysis of the new trends conducted between 2020 and 2022. The study concludes by emphasizing the significance of ongoing research and development of neural network-based pest detection systems to maintain sustainable and efficient agricultural production.

AB  - Public urban green spaces provide people with many benefits. Understanding the relationship between public urban green spaces? characteristics and human well-being components may assist in future planning and design of these spaces. This study performed a systematic bibliographic review to analyse the relationships between green spaces? specific characteristics and human well-being components. The green spaces characteristics found in 153 articles were divided in four groups: structure, biodiversity, naturalness, and others; while dimensions of human well-being were divided into four groups: health, security, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action. The number of green spaces and their percentage of vegetation cover and size (structure category) improved human well-being, in all aspects, especially in health. Structure and biodiversity are the characteristics most highly rated in the literature. These green spaces? biodiversity and naturalness contribute to human wellbeing through improvements in health (particularly mental health) and good social relations. The most frequently methods used to assess the relationship of public urban green spaces and human well-being are mainly oriented towards studying perception of the green space?s users. This result highlights an opportunity to assess the congruence between methods evaluating perception and objective measurement. Our findings may provide tools for decision-makers to integrate green spaces into planning, identifying specific characteristics of public urban green spaces that promote human well-being and to face climate change.

AB  - Institutionalized Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a widely debated phenomenon, addressed by both scientific literature and policymakers. The most important contribution of this work is to describe the various theories used for understanding the performance expectations of PPPs, as the focus on performance is still poor despite the growing interest in participant companies (mixed-owned companies), especially at the local level. While analyzing the evaluation of the performance of these entities, a wide stream of literature has focused on profitability and efficiency, showing a substantial difference in terms of the performance of such companies compared to private capital ones. All this leads us to consider the Public Value theory as the best framework in literature to address the many dimensions of performance and business strategy in PPPs while pursuing sustainable development. The interest in this area has increased lately, mainly due to the growing complexity within this dynamic context. Therefore, it seems meaningful to carry out a systematic review of the relevant published literature in this field. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development in Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) that are seen as a form of mixed-owned companies, trying to address their multilayered performance expectations within the public value perspective and to understand how the role of performance measurement is influencing business strategies and the attitude towards sustainable environment. This will prove useful to scholars, policymakers and practitioners alike.
